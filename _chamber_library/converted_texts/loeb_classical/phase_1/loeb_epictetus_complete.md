	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The contrast intended is between γράφω, “write,” § 2, and

	of Plato and Xenophon, which, although they purported to reproduce
	the words of Socrates, were in fact highly finished literary
	compositions.

	and the frankness of his speech. They are, accordingly, as
	you might expect, such remarks as one man might make
	off-hand to another, not such as he would compose for men
	to read in after time. This being their character, they have
	fallen, I know not how, without my will or knowledge, into
	the hands of men. Yet to me it is a matter of small concern
	if I shall be thought incapable of “composing” a work, and
	to Epictetus of no concern at all if anyone shall despise his
	words, seeing that even when he uttered them he was
	clearly aiming at nothing else but to incite the minds of
	his hearers to the best things. If, now, these words of his
	should produce that same effect, they would have, I think,
	just that success which the words of the philosophers ought
	to have; but if not, let those who read them be assured of
	this, that when Epictetus himself spoke them, the hearer
	could not help but feel exactly what Epictetus wanted him
	to feel. If, however, the words by themselves do not produce

	far the art of music? Only so far as to pass judgement upon
	the melody. Does either of them, then, contemplate itself?
	Not at all. But if you are writing to a friend and are at a loss
	as to what to write, the art of grammar will tell you; yet
	whether or not you are to write to your friend at all, the art
	of grammar will not tell. The same holds true of the art of
	music with regard to melodies; but whether you are at this
	moment to sing and play on the lyre, or neither sing nor
	play, it will not tell. What art or faculty, then, will tell? That
	one which contemplates both itself and everything else.
	And what is this? The reasoning faculty; for this is the only
	one we have inherited which will take knowledge both of
	itself—what it is, and of what it is capable, and how valuable
	a gift it is to us—and likewise of all the other faculties.
	For what else is it that tells us gold is beautiful? For the
	gold itself does not tell us. Clearly it is the faculty which
	makes use of external impressions. What else judges with
	discernment the art of music, the art of grammar, the other
	arts and faculties, passing judgement upon their uses and
	pointing out the seasonable occasions for their use? Nothing
	else does.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As was fitting, therefore, the gods have put under our
	control only the most excellent faculty of all and that which
	dominates the rest, namely, the power to make correct use
	of external impressions, but all the others they have not
	put under our control. Was it indeed because they would
	not? I for one think that had they been able they would
	have entrusted us with the others also; but they were quite
	unable to do that. For since we are upon earth and trammelled
	by an earthy body and by earthy associates, how was
	it possible that, in respect of them, we should not be hampered
	by external things?

	But what says Zeus? “Epictetus, had it been possible I
	should have made both this paltry body and this small
	estate of thine free and unhampered. But as it is—let it not
	escape thee—this body is not thine own, but only clay
	cunningly compounded. Yet since I could not give thee
	this, we have given thee a certain portion of ourself, this
	faculty of choice and refusal, of desire and aversion, or, in
	a word, the faculty which makes use of external impressions;
	if thou care for this and place all that thou hast
	therein, thou shalt never be thwarted, never hampered,
	shalt not groan, shalt not blame, shalt not flatter any man.
	What then? Are these things small in thy sight?” “Far be it
	from me!” “Art thou, then, content with them?” “I pray the
	Gods I may be.”[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But now, although it is in our power to care for one
	thing only and devote ourselves to but one, we choose
	rather to care for many things, and to be tied fast to many,
	even to our body and our estate and brother and friend
	and child and slave. Wherefore, being tied fast to many
	things, we are burdened and dragged down by them. That
	is why, if the weather keeps us from sailing, we sit down
	and fidget[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] and keep constantly peering about. “What wind
	is blowing?” we ask. Boreas. “What have we to do with it?
	When will Zephyrus blow?” When it pleases, good sir, or
	rather when Aeolus pleases. For God has not made you
	steward of the winds, but Aeolus.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] “What then?” We must
	make the best of what is under our control, and take the
	rest as its nature is. “How, then, is its nature?” As God wills.

	“Must I, then, be the only one to be beheaded now?”
	Why, did you want everybody to be beheaded for your
	consolation? Are you not willing to stretch out your neck
	as did a certain Lateranus at Rome, when Nero ordered
	him to be beheaded? For he stretched out his neck and
	received the blow, but, as it was a feeble one, he shrank
	back for an instant, and then stretched out his neck again.
	Yes, and before that, when Epaphroditus, a freedman of
	Nero, approached a certain man and asked about the
	ground of his offence, he answered, “If I wish anything, I
	will speak to your master.”[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“What aid, then, must we have ready at hand in such
	circumstances?” Why, what else than the knowledge of
	what is mine, and what is not mine, and what is permitted
	me, and what is not permitted me? I must die: must I, then,
	die groaning too? I must be fettered: and wailing too? I
	must go into exile: does anyone, then, keep me from going
	with a smile and cheerful and serene? “Tell your secrets.”
	I say not a word; for this is under my control. “But I will
	fetter you.” What is that you say, man? fetter [c dimgray]me[/c]? My leg
	you will fetter, but my moral purpose not even Zeus himself
	has power to overcome. “I will throw you into prison.”
	My paltry body, rather! “I will behead you.” Well, when did
	I ever tell you that mine was the only neck that could not
	be severed? These are the lessons that philosophers ought
	to rehearse, these they ought to write down daily, in these
	they ought to exercise themselves.

	take a scourging[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] once they have learned that it is rational.—But
	is it not unendurable to be hanged?—Hardly;
	at all events whenever a man feels that it is rational he goes
	and hangs himself. In short, if we observe, we shall find
	mankind distressed by nothing so much as by the irrational,
	and again attracted to nothing so much as to the
	rational.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now it so happens that the rational and the irrational
	are different for different persons, precisely as good and
	evil, and the profitable and the unprofitable, are different
	for different persons. It is for this reason especially that we
	need education, so as to learn how, in conformity with
	nature, to adapt to specific instances our preconceived idea
	of what is rational and what is irrational. But for determining
	the rational and the irrational, we employ not only our
	estimates of the value of external things, but also the criterion
	of that which is in keeping with one’s own character.
	For to one man it is reasonable to hold a chamber-pot for
	another, since he considers only that, if he does not hold
	it, he will get a beating and will not get food, whereas, if
	he does hold it, nothing harsh or painful will be done to
	him; but some other man feels that it is not merely unendurable
	to hold such a pot himself, but even to tolerate
	another’s doing so. If you ask me, then, “Shall I hold the
	pot or not?” I will tell you that to get food is of greater value
	than not to get it, and to be flayed is of greater detriment
	than not to be; so that if you measure your interests by
	these standards, go and hold the pot. “Yes, but it would
	be unworthy of me.” That is an additional consideration,

	Wherefore, when Florus was debating whether he
	should enter Nero’s festival, so as to make some personal
	contribution to it, Agrippinus said to him, “Enter.” And
	when Florus asked, “Why do you not enter yourself?” he
	replied, “I? why, I do not even raise the question.” For
	when a man once stoops to the consideration of such questions,
	I mean to estimating the value of externals, and
	calculates them one by one, he comes very close to those
	who have forgotten their own proper character. Come,
	what is this you ask me? “Is death or life preferable?” I
	answer, life. “Pain or pleasure?” I answer, pleasure. “But
	unless I take a part in the tragedy[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] I shall be beheaded.”
	Go, then, and take a part, but I will not take a part. “Why
	not?” Because you regard yourself as but a single thread of
	all that go to make up the garment. What follows, then?
	This, that [c dimgray]you[/c] ought to take thought how you may resemble
	all other men, precisely as even the single thread wants to
	have no point of superiority in comparison with the other
	threads. But I want to be the red,[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] that small and brilliant
	portion which causes the rest to appear comely and beautiful.
	Why, then, do you say to me, “Be like the majority of
	people?” And if I do that, how shall I any longer be the

	to defend the whole herd? Or is it clear that with the

	of it also? And, so, among us too, whoever has

	the objects of aversion—such a one has utterly excluded
	desire from himself, or else deferred it to another
	time,[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] and feels aversion only toward the things which
	involve freedom of choice. For if he avoids anything that is
	not a matter of free choice, he knows that some time he
	will encounter something in spite of his aversion to it, and
	will come to grief. Now if it is virtue that holds out the
	promise thus to create happiness and calm and serenity,
	then assuredly progress toward virtue is progress toward
	each of these states of mind. For it is always true that
	whatsoever the goal toward which perfection in anything
	definitely leads, progress is an approach thereto.

	How comes it, then, that we acknowledge virtue to be

	Serenity. Who, then, is making progress? The man who has

	are declaring that the approach to virtue, which is progress,

	it there, wretch, where your work lies. And where is your
	work? In desire and aversion, that you may not miss what
	you desire and encounter what you would avoid; in choice

	Do you not know that the whole book costs only five denarii?

	Where, then, is progress? If any man among you, withdrawing
	from external things, has turned his attention to
	the question of his own moral purpose, cultivating and
	perfecting it so as to make it finally harmonious with nature,
	elevated, free, unhindered, untrammelled, faithful,
	and honourable; and if he has learned that he who craves
	or shuns the things that are not under his control can be
	neither faithful nor free, but must himself of necessity be
	changed and tossed to and fro with them, and must end by
	subordinating himself to others, those, namely, who are
	able to procure or prevent these things that he craves or
	shuns; and if, finally, when he rises in the morning he
	proceeds to keep and observe all this that he has learned;
	if he bathes as a faithful man, eats as a self-respecting
	man,—similarly, whatever the subject matter may be with
	which he has to deal, putting into practice his guiding
	principles, as the runner does when he applies the principles
	of running, and the voice-trainer when he applies the
	principles of voice-training,—this is the man who in all
	truth is making progress, and the man who has not travelled
	at random is this one. But if he has striven merely to
	attain the state which he finds in his books and works only
	at that, and has made that the goal of his travels, I bid him
	go home at once and not neglect his concerns there, since
	the goal to which he has travelled is nothing; but not so
	that other goal—to study how a man may rid his life of
	sorrows and lamentations, and of such cries as “Woe is me!”

	for that set up an altar in his honour, or dedicated a temple

	[b] 5. Against the Academics[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c][/b]
	If a man, says Epictetus, resists truths that are all too
	evident, in opposing him it is not easy to find an argument
	by which one may cause him to change his opinion. The
	reason for this is neither the man’s ability nor the teacher’s
	weakness; nay, when a man who has been trapped in an
	argument hardens to stone, how shall one any longer deal
	with him by argument?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now there are two kinds of petrifaction: one is the
	petrifaction of the intellect, the other of the sense of
	shame, when a man stands in array, prepared neither to
	assent to manifest truths nor to leave the fighting line.
	Most of us dread the deadening of the body and would
	resort to all means so as to avoid falling into such a state,
	but about the deadening of the soul we care not at all.
	Indeed, by Zeus, even in the case of the soul itself, if a man

	is in a bad way; another man notices it, indeed,
	but is not moved and does not improve—he is in a still

	If God had made colours, but had not made the faculty
	of seeing them, of what good had it been?—None at
	all.—But, conversely, if He had made the faculty, but in
	making objects, had made them incapable of falling under
	the faculty of vision, in that case also of what good had it
	been?—None at all.—What then, if He had even made
	both of these, but had not made light?—Even thus it would
	have been of no use.—Who is it, then, that has fitted this
	to that and that to this? And who is it that has fitted the
	sword to the scabbard, and the scabbard to the sword? No

	we are accustomed to prove that the work is certainly the
	product of some artificer, and has not been constructed at

	Does, then, every such work reveal its artificer, but do

	the organs which have been constructed for this purpose,
	do these things not reveal their artificer either? Well, admit

	we do not merely have their forms impressed upon us, but
	also make a selection from among them, and subtract and

	which are in a manner related to them—is not even all this
	sufficient to stir our friends and induce them not to leave
	the artificer out of account? Else let them explain to us
	what it is that produces each of these results, or how it
	is possible that objects so wonderful and so workmanlike
	should come into being at random and spontaneously.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What then? Is it in the case of man alone that these
	things occur? You will, indeed, find many things in man
	only, things of which the rational animal had a peculiar
	need, but you will also find many possessed by us in common
	with the irrational animals. Do they also, then, understand
	what happens? No! for use is one thing, and understanding
	another. God had need of the animals in that they
	make use of external impressions, and of us in that we
	understand the use of external impressions. And so for
	them it is sufficient to eat and drink and rest and procreate,
	and whatever else of the things within their own province
	the animals severally do; while for us, to whom He has
	made the additional gift of the faculty of understanding,
	these things are no longer sufficient, but unless we act
	appropriately, and methodically, and in conformity each
	with his own nature and constitution, we shall no longer
	achieve our own ends. For of beings whose constitutions
	are different, the works and the ends are likewise different.
	So for the being whose constitution is adapted to use only,
	mere use is sufficient, but where a being has also the faculty
	of understanding the use, unless the principle of propriety
	be added, he will never attain his end. What then?
	Each of the animals God constitutes, one to be eaten, another
	to serve in farming, another to produce cheese, and
	yet another for some other similar use; to perform these
	functions what need have they to understand external impressions

	and to be able to differentiate between them?
	But God has brought man into the world to be a spectator
	of Himself and of His works, and not merely a spectator,
	but also an interpreter. Wherefore, it is shameful for man
	to begin and end just where the irrational animals do; he
	should rather begin where they do, but end where nature
	has ended in dealing with us. Now she did not end until
	she reached contemplation and understanding and a manner
	of life harmonious with nature. Take heed, therefore,
	lest you die without ever having been spectators of these

	But you travel to Olympia to behold the work[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c] of
	Pheidias, and each of you regards it as a misfortune to die
	without seeing such sights; yet when there is no need to
	travel at all, but where Zeus is already, and is present in his

	them? Will you decline, therefore, to perceive either who
	you are, or for what you have been born, or what that
	purpose is for which you have received sight?—But some
	unpleasant and hard things happen in life.—And do they
	not happen at Olympia? Do you not swelter? Are you not
	cramped and crowded? Do you not bathe with discomfort?
	Are you not drenched whenever it rains? Do you not have
	your fill of tumult and shouting and other annoyances? But
	I fancy that you hear and endure all this by balancing it off
	against the memorable character of the spectacle. Come,

	the one which he encountered, and a hydra, and a stag, and
	a boar, and wicked and brutal men, whom he made it his
	business to drive out and clear away? And what would he

	been? What would have been the use of those arms of his

	interrogation, and, in general, the handling of all such arguments,[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c]
	has a bearing upon the duties of life. For our
	aim in every matter of inquiry is to learn how the good and
	excellent man may find the appropriate course through it
	and the appropriate way of conducting himself in it. Let
	them say, then, either that the good man will not enter the
	contest of question and answer, or that, once he has entered,
	he will be at no pains to avoid conducting himself
	carelessly and at haphazard in question and answer; or else,
	if they accept neither of these alternatives, they must admit
	that some investigation should be made of those topics
	with which question and answer are principally concerned.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For what is the professed object of reasoning? To state
	the true, to eliminate the false, to suspend judgement in
	doubtful cases. Is it enough, then, to learn this alone?—It
	is enough, says one.—Is it, then, also enough for the man
	who wants to make no mistake in the use of money to be
	told the reason why you accept genuine drachmas and reject
	the counterfeit?—It is not enough.—What, then, must
	be added to this? Why, what else but the faculty that tests
	the genuine drachmas and the counterfeit and distinguishes
	between them? Wherefore, in reasoning also the
	spoken word is not enough, is it? On the contrary, is it not
	necessary to develop the power of testing the true and

	[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c]With the Stoics, whose sole standard of judgement in problems
	of conduct was the appeal to reason, the proper training of
	the reasoning faculties was an indispensable prerequisite to the good life. Three modes of sophistical reasoning are here differentiated.
	“Equivocal premisses” (μεταπίπτοντες λόγοι) are those
	that contain ambiguities in terms which are intended to mean one
	thing at one step in the argument, another at another. “Hypothetical
	premisses” involve assumptions, or conditions. The last class
	proceeds by drawing unexpected conclusions from the answers to
	questions.

	the false and the uncertain and of distinguishing between
	them?—It is necessary.—What else besides this is proposed
	in reasoning? Pray accept the consequence of what
	you have properly granted. Come, is it enough, then, in this
	case also merely to know that this particular thing is true?
	It is not enough, but one must learn in what way a thing
	follows as a consequence upon certain other things, and
	how sometimes one thing follows upon one, and at other
	times upon several conjointly. Is it not, then, necessary that
	a man should also acquire this power, if he is to acquit
	himself intelligently in argument, and is himself not only
	to prove each point when he tries to prove it, but also to
	follow the argument of those who are conducting a proof,
	and is not to be misled by men who quibble as though they
	were proving something? There has consequently arisen
	among us, and shown itself to be necessary, a science which
	deals with inferential arguments and with logical figures
	and trains men therein.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But of course there are times when we have with sound
	reasoning granted the premisses, and the inference from
	them is so-and-so; and, in spite of its being false, it is none
	the less the inference. What, then, should I do? Accept the
	fallacy? And how is that possible? Well, should I say, “it was
	not sound reasoning for me to grant the premisses?” Nay,
	but this is not permissible either. Or, “This does not follow
	from what has been granted?” But that is not permissible,
	either. What, then, must be done in these circumstances?
	Is it not this, that the fact of having borrowed is not enough
	to prove that one is still in debt, but we must add the
	circumstance that one abides by the loan—that is, has not
	paid it—and just so our having once granted the premisses
	is not enough to compel us to accept the inference, but we

	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c]At this point Upton introduced from his ‘codex’ a sentence
	intended to express fully the transition in the argument (§ 18): μὴ
	μενόντων δὲ αὐτῶν ὁποῖα παρεχωρήθη, καὶ ἡμᾶς πᾶσα
	ἀνάγκη τῆς παραχωρήσεως ἀφίστασθαι καὶ <τοῦ Schw.> τὸ

	do not remain as they were granted, we are also bound to abandon
	our concession and our acceptance of what is inconsistent with the
	premisses.” Schenkl indicates a lacuna.

	must abide by our acceptance of the premisses? And what
	is more, if the premisses remain until the end what they
	were when they were granted, there is every necessity for
	us to abide by our acceptance of them, and to allow the
	conclusion that has been drawn from them;…for from our
	point of view and to our way of thinking this inference does
	not now result from the premisses, since we have withdrawn
	from our previous assent to the premisses. It is
	necessary, therefore, to enquire into premisses of this kind
	and into such change and equivocal modification of them,
	whereby, at the very moment the question is put, or the
	answer made, or the deduction drawn, or at some other
	similar stage in the argument, the premisses take on modified
	meanings and give occasion to the unthinking to be
	disconcerted, if they do not see what follows in consequence.
	Why is it necessary? In order that in this matter
	we may not behave unsuitably, nor at haphazard, nor confusedly.

	And the same holds true of hypotheses and hypothetical
	arguments. For it is necessary at times to postulate some
	hypothesis as a sort of stepping-stone for the subsequent
	argument. Are we, therefore, to grant any and every hypothesis
	that is proposed, or not every one? And if not
	every one, what one? And when a man has granted an
	hypothesis, must he abide for ever by it and maintain it, or
	are there times when he should abandon it and accept only
	the consequences which follow from it without accepting

	“If you once admit an hypothesis that involves a possibility,

	the prudent man refuse to engage with this person, and
	avoid enquiry and discussion with him? Yet who but the

	In as many ways as it is possible to vary the meaning

	the forms of his controversial arguments and of his enthymemes[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c]
	in reasoning. Take this syllogism, for instance:
	[c dimgray]If you have borrowed and have not repaid, you owe me the
	money; now you have not borrowed and have not repaid;
	therefore you do not owe me the money[/c]. And no man is
	better fitted to employ such variations skilfully than the
	philosopher. For if, indeed, the enthymeme is an incomplete
	syllogism, it is clear that he who has been exercised
	in the perfect syllogism would be no less competent to deal
	with the imperfect also.

	Why, then, do we neglect to exercise ourselves and one
	another in this way? Because, even now, without receiving

	of the “definite proof” accorded by the syllogism.

	therefore, must we expect, if we should take on this occupation
	also? And especially since it would not merely be an
	additional occupation to draw us away from those which
	are more necessary, but would also be an exceptional excuse
	for conceit and vanity. For great is the power of argumentation
	and persuasive reasoning, and especially if it
	should enjoy excessive exercise and receive likewise a certain
	additional ornament from language. The reason is
	that, in general, every faculty which is acquired by the
	uneducated and the weak is dangerous for them, as being
	apt to make them conceited and puffed up over it. For by
	what device might one any longer persuade a young man
	who excels in these faculties to make them an appendage
	to himself instead of his becoming an appendage to them?
	Does he not trample all these reasons under foot, and strut

	strive to become handsome, or become strong, on the assumption

	For why do you say that you are an Athenian, instead of

	a higher degree of authority and comprehends not merely

	the source from which your race has come, your ancestors
	down to yourself, and from some such entity call yourself

	and whatever things on their account are necessary

	as burdensome and vexatious and unprofitable and depart
	to their kindred. And this is the struggle in which your

	ought to be engaged; you, for your part, would come to him
	saying: “Epictetus, we can no longer endure to be imprisoned

	resting and cleansing it, and, to crown all, being on its
	account brought into contact with these people and those.
	Are not these things indifferent—indeed, nothing—to us?
	And is not death no evil? And are we not in a manner akin

	back whence we came; suffer us to be freed at last from

	same result from you?”[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c] For, in fact, it is foolish and superfluous
	to try to obtain from another that which one can
	get from oneself. Since, therefore, I am able to get greatness
	of soul and nobility of character from myself, am I to
	get a farm, and money, or some office, from you? Far from
	it! I will not be so unaware of what I myself possess. But
	when a man is cowardly and abject, what else can one
	possibly do but write letters in his behalf as we do in behalf
	of a corpse: “Please to grant us the carcase of so-and-so and
	a pint of paltry blood?”[c dimgray][sup]39[/sup][/c] For really, such a person is but a

	hearts, perhaps we too should be accomplishing something.
	I know a man older than myself who is now in charge
	of the grain supply[c dimgray][sup]40[/sup][/c] at Rome. When he passed this place
	on his way back from exile, I recall what a tale he told as
	he inveighed against his former life and announced for the
	future that, when he had returned to Rome, he would
	devote himself solely to spending the remainder of his life
	in peace and quiet, “for how little is yet left to me!”—And

	I told him, “You will not do it, but when once you have
	caught no more than a whiff of Rome you will forget all
	this.” And if also admission to court should be granted, I
	added that he would rejoice, thank God and push his way
	in.—“If you find me, Epictetus,” said he, “putting so much
	as one foot inside the court, think of me what you will.”
	Well, now, what did he do? Before he reached Rome, letters
	from Caesar met him; and as soon as he received them,
	he forgot all those resolutions of his, and ever since he has
	been piling up one property after another. I wish I could
	stand by his side now and remind him of the words that he
	uttered as he passed by here, and remark, “How much
	more clever a prophet I am than you!”

	What then? Do I say that man is an animal made for
	inactivity?[c dimgray][sup]41[/sup][/c] Far be it from me! But how can you say that
	we philosophers are not active in affairs? For example, to
	take myself first: as soon as day breaks I call to mind briefly
	what author I must read over.[c dimgray][sup]42[/sup][/c] Then forthwith I say to
	myself: “And yet what difference does it really make to me
	how so-and-so reads? The first thing is that I get my sleep.”
	Even so, in what are the occupations of those other men
	comparable to ours? If you observe what they do, you will

	[c dimgray][sup]42[/sup][/c]The passage is somewhat obscure, because the precise expression
	employed here occurs elsewhere only in [c dimgray]Ench.[/c] 49. Apparently
	Epictetus read over, or made special preparation upon a
	certain text, before meeting his pupils. In class then he would have
	a pupil read and interpret an assignment, somewhat as in our “recitation,” and follow that by a reading and exposition of his own
	(ἐπαναγνῶναι), which was intended to set everything straight and
	put on the finishing touches. See Schweighäuser’s note and especially
	Ivo Bruns, [c dimgray]De Schola Epicteti[/c] (1897), 8 f. By changing μέ to
	μοί as Capps suggests, a satisfactory sense is secured, [c dimgray]i.e.[/c], what
	pupil must read to me,” but the ἐπί in the compound verb would
	thus be left without any particular meaning, and perhaps it is not
	necessary to emend.

	I up and ran away, until someone brought me word that
	she was well again.—What then, do you feel that you were
	acting right in doing this?—I was acting naturally, he
	said.—But really, you must first convince me of this, that
	you [c dimgray]were[/c] acting naturally, said he, and then I will convince
	you that whatever is done in accordance with nature is
	rightly done.—This is the way, said the man, all, or at least
	most, of us fathers feel.—And I do not contradict you
	either, answered Epictetus, and say that it is not done, but
	the point at issue between us is the other, whether it is
	rightly done. For by your style of reasoning we should have
	to say of tumours also that they are produced for the good
	of the body, just because they occur, and in brief, that to
	err is in accordance with nature, just because practically
	all of us, or at least most of us, do err. Do you show me,
	therefore, how your conduct is in accordance with nature.—
	I cannot, said the man; but do you rather show me
	how it is not in accordance with nature, and not rightly
	done. And Epictetus said: Well, if we were enquiring about
	white and black objects, what sort of criterion should we
	summon in order to distinguish between them?—The
	sight, said the man.—And if about hot and cold, and hard
	and soft objects, what criterion?—The touch.—Very well,
	then, since we are disputing about things which are in
	accordance with nature and things which are rightly or not
	rightly done, what criterion would you have us take?—I do
	not know, he said.—And yet, though it is, perhaps, no great
	harm for one not to know the criterion of colours and
	odours, and so, too, of flavours, still do you think that it is
	a slight harm for a man to be ignorant of the criterion of
	good and evil things, and of those in accordance with nature

	are indispensable.—He agreed.—You, then, said he, now

	reasonable, this we confidently assert to be both right and
	good?—Granted, said he.—What then? I suppose you will
	not deny that going away and leaving one’s child when it
	is sick is at least not reasonable. But we have yet to consider
	whether it is affectionate.—Yes, let us consider
	that.—Were you, then, since you were affectionately disposed
	to your child, doing right when you ran away and left
	her? And has the mother no affection for her child?—On
	the contrary, she has affection.—Ought then the mother
	also to have left her child, or ought she not?—She ought
	not.—What of the nurse? Does she love her child?—She
	does, he said.—Ought, then, she also to have left her?—By
	no means.—What about the school attendant? Does not
	he love the child?—He does.—Ought, then, he as well to
	have gone away and left her, so that the child would thus
	have been left alone and helpless because of the great
	affection of you her parents and of those in charge of her,
	or, perhaps, have died in the arms of those who neither
	loved her nor cared for her?—Far from it!—And yet is it
	not unfair and unfeeling, when a man thinks certain conduct
	fitting for himself because of his affection, that he
	should not allow the same to others who have as much
	affection as he has?—That were absurd.—Come, if it had
	been you who were sick, would you have wanted all your
	relatives, your children and your wife included, to show
	their affection in such a way that you would be left all alone
	and deserted by them?—By no means.—And would you
	pray to be so loved by your own that, because of their
	excessive affection, you would always be left alone in sickness?

	enough for us to be convinced that, if what the philosophers
	say is sound, we ought not to look for the motive
	anywhere outside of ourselves, but that in all cases it is one
	and the same thing that is the cause of our doing a thing

	Concerning gods there are some who say that the divine
	does not so much as exist; and others, that it exists, indeed,
	but is inactive and indifferent, and takes forethought for
	nothing;[c dimgray][sup]45[/sup][/c] and a third set, that it exists and takes forethought,
	though only for great and heavenly things and in
	no case for terrestrial things; and a fourth set, that it also
	takes forethought for things terrestrial and the affairs of
	men, but only in a general way, and not for the individual in
	particular; and a fifth set, to which Odysseus and Socrates

	We must, therefore, first of all enquire about each of
	these statements, to see whether it is sound or not sound.
	For if gods do not exist, how can it be an end to follow the
	gods? And if they exist, indeed, but care for nothing, how
	even thus will that conclusion be sound? But if, indeed,
	they both exist and exercise care, yet there is no communication
	from them to men,—yes, and, by Zeus, to me

	be sound? The good and excellent man must, therefore,

	of the body, and property and companions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Mindful, therefore, of this ordaining we should go to
	receive instruction, not in order to change the constitution
	of things,—for this is neither vouchsafed us nor is it better
	that it should be,—but in order that, things about us being
	as they are and as their nature is, we may, for our own part,
	keep our wills in harmony with what happens. For, look
	you, can we escape from men? And how is it possible? But
	can we, if they associate with us, change them? And who
	vouchsafes us that power? What alternative remains, then,
	or what method can we find for living with them? Some
	such method as that, while they will act as seems best to
	them, we shall none the less be in a state comfortable to
	nature. But you are impatient and peevish, and if you are
	alone, you call it a solitude, but if you are in the company
	of men, you call them schemers and brigands, and you find
	fault even with your own parents and children and brothers
	and neighbours. But you ought, when staying alone, to call
	that peace and freedom, and to look upon yourself as like
	the gods; and when you are in the company of many, you
	ought not call that a mob, nor a tumult, nor a disgusting
	thing, but a feast and a festival, and so accept all things
	contentedly.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, is the punishment of those who do not
	accept? To be just as they are. Is one peevish because he
	is alone? Let him be in solitude! Is he peevish with his
	parents? Let him be an evil son and grieve! Is he peevish

	is there against his will, and where a man is against his will,

	[b][c dimgray]15. What does philosophy profess?[/c][/b]
	When someone consulted Epictetus as to how he could
	persuade his brother to cease being angry with him, he
	replied, Philosophy does not profess to secure for man any
	external possession. Otherwise it would be undertaking
	something that lies outside its proper subject-matter. For
	as wood is the material of the carpenter, bronze that of
	the statuary, just so each man’s own life is the subject-matter
	of the art of living.—Well, what about my brother’s
	life?—That again is the subject-matter of his own art of
	living, but with respect to [c dimgray]your[/c] art of living it comes under
	the category of externals, like a farm, like health, like good
	repute. Philosophy promises none of these things, but
	rather, “In every circumstance I will keep the governing
	principle[c dimgray][sup]50[/sup][/c] in a state of accord with nature.”—Whose governing
	principle?—“His in whom I am.”—How, then, shall
	I keep my brother from being angry at me?—Bring him to
	me and I will tell him, but I have nothing to say to [c dimgray]you[/c] on
	the subject of [c dimgray]his[/c] anger.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And when the man who was consulting him said, What
	I seek to know is this, how, even if my brother refuses to
	be reconciled with me, I may yet be in accord with nature,
	Epictetus replied: Nothing great comes into being all at
	once; why, not even does the bunch of grapes, or a fig. If

	Marvel not that the animals other than man have furnished
	them, ready prepared by nature, what pertains to
	their bodily needs—not merely food and drink, but also a
	bed to lie on,—and that they have no need of shoes, or
	bedding, or clothing, while we are in need of all these
	things. For in the case of animals, born not for their own
	sake, but for service, to have created them in need of other
	things was not beneficial. Why, consider what it would be
	for us to have to take thought not for merely ourselves, but
	also for our sheep and our asses, how they are to be clothed
	and shod, how they are to find food and drink. but just as
	soldiers appear before their general, all ready for service,
	shod, clothed and armed, and it would be shocking if the
	colonel had to go around and equip his regiment with
	shoes or uniforms; so also nature has made animals, which
	are born for service, ready for use, equipped, and in need
	of no further attention. Consequently one small child with
	a rod can drive a flock of sheep.

	beasts, because we do not have to bestow upon them the
	same care as we require for ourselves, and then proceed to
	complain against God on our own account! Yet, by Zeus
	and the gods, one single gift of nature would suffice to
	make a man who is reverent and grateful perceive the
	providence of God. Do not talk to me now of great matters:
	take the mere fact that milk is produced from grass,
	and cheese from milk, and that wool grows from
	skin—who is it that has created or devised these things?

	Come, let us leave the chief works of nature, and consider

	more useless than the hairs on a chin? Well, what then?
	Has not nature used even these in the most suitable way
	possible? Has she not by these means distinguished between
	the male and the female? Does not the nature of
	each one among us cry aloud forthwith from afar, “I am a
	man; on this understanding approach me, on this understanding
	talk with me; ask for nothing further; behold the
	signs?” Again, in the case of women, just as nature has
	mingled in their voice a certain softer note, so likewise she
	has taken the hair from their chins. Not so, you say; on the
	contrary the human animal ought to have been left without
	distinguishing features, and each of us ought to proclaim
	by word of mouth, “I am a man.” Nay, but how fair and
	becoming and dignified the sign is! How much more fair
	than the cock’s comb, how much more magnificent than
	the lion’s mane! Wherefore, we ought to preserve the signs
	which God has given; we ought not to throw them away; we
	ought not, so far as in us lies, to confuse the sexes which
	have been distinguished in this fashion.

	shall it be analyzed? Why, clearly, either by itself, or by
	something else. This latter is assuredly either reason, or it
	will prove to be something else superior to reason, which
	is impossible. If it be reason, who again will analyze [c dimgray]that[/c]
	reason? For if it analyzes its own self, the reason with
	which we started can do as much. If we are going to require

	“Yes,” says someone, “but the cure (of the decisions of
	our will) is a much more pressing need (than the study of
	logic),”[c dimgray][sup]52[/sup][/c] and the like. Do you then wish to hear about this
	other matter? Very well, listen. But if you say to me, “I do
	not know whether your argument is true or false,” and, if
	I use some ambiguous term, and you should then say, “Distinguish,”
	I shall bear with you no longer, but shall tell you,
	“Nay, but there is a much more pressing need.” This is the
	reason, I suppose, why the Stoic philosophers put Logic
	first, just as in the measuring of grain we put first the
	examination of the measure. And if we do not define first
	what a [c dimgray]modius[/c][c dimgray][sup]53[/sup][/c] is, and do not define first what a scale is,
	how shall we be able to proceed with measuring or weighing
	anything? So, in the field of our present enquiry, if we
	have neglected the thorough knowledge and intellectual
	mastery of our standard of judgement for all other things,
	whereby they come to be known thoroughly, shall we ever
	be able to attain intellectual mastery and thorough knowledge
	of the rest of the world? And how could we possibly?
	“Yes,” we are told, “but the [c dimgray]modius[/c] is made out of wood
	and bears no fruit.” True, but it is something with which
	we can measure grain. “Logic also bears no fruit.” Now as

	[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c]Reason, therefore, can be analyzed only by itself.

	for this statement we shall see later; but if one should grant
	even this, it is enough to say in defence of Logic that it has
	the power to discriminate and examine everything else,
	and as one might say, to measure and weigh them. Who
	says this? Only Chrysippus and Zeno and Cleanthes? Well,
	does not Antisthenes say it? And who is it that wrote, “The
	beginning of education is the examination of terms?” Does
	not Socrates,[c dimgray][sup]54[/sup][/c] too, say the same thing? And of whom does
	Xenophon write, that he began with the examination of
	terms, asking about each, “What does it mean?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Is this, then, your great and admirable achievement—the ability to understand and to interpret Chrysippus? And
	who says that? What, then, is your admirable achievement?
	To understand the will of nature. Very well; do you understand
	it all by yourself? And if that is the case, what more
	do you need? For if it is true that “all men err involuntarily,”[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c]
	and you have learned the truth, it must needs be that
	you are doing right already. But, so help me Zeus, I do
	not comprehend the will of nature. Who, then, interprets
	it? Men say, Chrysippus. I go and try to find out what
	this interpreter of nature says. I begin not to understand
	what he says, and look for the man who can interpret him.
	“Look and consider what this passage means,” says the
	interpreter, “just as if it were in Latin!”[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c] What place is
	there here, then, for pride on the part of the interpreter?
	Why, there is no just place for pride even on the part of
	Chrysippus, if he merely interprets the will of nature, but
	himself does not follow it; how much less place for pride,

	[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c]Epictetus seems to be placing himself in the position of one
	of his Roman pupils, who would understand Chrysippus more

	then, in the case of his interpreter! For we have no need
	of Chrysippus on his own account, but only to enable us to
	follow nature. No more have we need of him who divines
	through sacrifice, considered on his own account, but simply
	because we think that through his instrumentality we
	shall understand the future and the signs given by the gods;
	nor do we need the entrails on their own account, but only
	because through them the signs are given; nor do we admire
	the crow or the raven, but God, who gives His signs
	through them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Wherefore, I go to this interpreter and diviner and say,
	“Examine for me the entrails, and tell me what signs they
	give.” The fellow takes and spreads them out and then
	interprets: “Man, you have a moral purpose free by nature
	from hindrances and constraint. This stands written here
	in these entrails. I will prove you that first in the sphere of
	assent. Can anyone prevent you from assenting to truth?
	No one at all. Can anyone force you to accept the false?
	No one at all. Do you see that in this sphere you have a
	moral purpose free from hindrance, constraint, obstruction?
	Come, in the sphere of desire and choice is it otherwise?
	And what can overcome one impulse but another
	impulse? And what can overcome one desire or aversion
	but another desire or aversion?” “But,” says someone, “if a
	person subjects me to the fear of death, he compels me.”
	“No, it is not what you are subjected to that impels you,
	but the fact that you decide it is better for you to do something
	of the sort than to die. Once more, then, it is the
	decision of your own will which compelled you, that is,
	moral purpose compelled moral purpose. For if God had
	so constructed that part of His own being which He has
	taken from Himself and bestowed upon us, that it could be

	If what the philosophers[c dimgray][sup]57[/sup][/c] say is true, that in all men
	thought and action start from a single source, namely feeling—as
	in the case of assent the feeling that a thing is so,
	and in the case of dissent the feeling that it is not so, yes,
	and, by Zeus, in the case of suspended judgement the
	feeling that it is uncertain, so also in the case of impulse
	towards a thing, the feeling that it is expedient for me and
	that it is impossible to judge one thing expedient and yet
	desire another, and again, to judge one thing fitting, and
	yet be impelled to another—if all this be true, why are we
	any longer angry with the multitude?—“They are thieves,”

	these men rob us. For, mark you, stop admiring[c dimgray][sup]58[/sup][/c] your
	clothes, and you are not angry at the man who steals them;
	stop admiring your wife’s beauty, and you are not angry at
	her adulterer. Know that a thief or an adulterer has no
	place among the things that are your own, but only among
	the things that are another’s and that are not under your
	control. If you give these things up and count them as
	nothing, at whom have you still ground to feel angry? But
	so long as you admire these things, be angry at yourself and
	not at the men that I have just mentioned. For consider;
	you have fine clothes and your neighbour does not; you
	have a window and wish to air them. [c dimgray]He[/c] does not know
	wherein the true good of man consists, but fancies that it
	consists in having fine clothes, the very same fancy that you
	also entertain. Shall he not come, then, and carry them off?
	Why, when you show a cake to gluttonous men and then
	gulp it down all to yourself, are you not wanting them to
	snatch it? Stop provoking them, stop having a window, stop
	airing your clothes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Something similar happened to me also the other day.
	I keep an iron lamp by the side of my household gods, and,
	on hearing a noise at the window, I ran down. I found that
	the lamp had been stolen. I reflected that the man who
	stole it was moved by no unreasonable motive. What then?
	To-morrow, I say, you will find one of earthenware. Indeed,
	a man loses only that which he already has. “I have lost my
	cloak.” Yes, for you had a cloak. “I have a pain in my head.”
	You don’t have a pain in your horns, do you? Why, then,
	are you indignant? For our losses and our pains have to do
	only with the things which we possess.

	chain nor cut off? Your moral purpose. This is why the
	ancients gave us the injunction, “Know thyself.” What follows,
	then? Why, but the Gods, that one ought to practise
	in small things, and beginning with them pass on to the
	greater. “I have a head-ache.” Well, do not say “Alas!” “I
	have an ear-ache.” Do not say “Alas!” And I am not saying
	that it is not permissible to groan, only do not groan in the
	centre of your being. And if your slave is slow in bringing
	your bandage, do not cry out and make a wry face and say,
	“Everybody hates me.” Why, who would not hate such a
	person? For the future put your confidence in these doctrines
	and walk about erect, free, not putting your confidence
	in the size of your body, like an athlete; for you ought
	not to be invincible in the way an ass is invincible.[c dimgray][sup]59[/sup][/c]

	Who, then, is the invincible man? He whom nothing
	that is outside the sphere of his moral purpose can dismay.
	I then proceed to consider the circumstances one by one,
	as I would do in the case of the athlete. “This fellow has
	won the first round. What, then, will he do in the second?
	What if it be scorching hot? And what will he do at Olympia?”
	It is the same way with the case under consideration.
	If you put a bit of silver coin in a man’s way, he will despise
	it. Yes, but if you put a bit of a wench in his way, what then?
	Or if it be in the dark, what then? Or if you throw a bit of

	I mean by the invincible athlete.

	[b][c dimgray]19. How ought we to bear ourselves toward tyrants?[/c][/b]
	If a man possesses some superiority, or thinks at least
	that he does, even thought he does not, it is quite unavoidable
	that this man, if he is uneducated, becomes puffed up
	on account of it. For example, the tyrant exclaims, “I am
	the mightiest in the world.” Very well, what can you do for
	me? Can you secure for me desire that is free from any hindrance?
	How can you? Do you have it yourself? Can you
	secure for me aversion proof against encountering what it
	would avoid? Do you have it yourself? Or infallible choice?
	And where can you claim a share in that? Come, when you
	are on board ship, do you feel confidence in yourself, or in
	the skilled navigator? And when you are in a chariot, in
	whom do you feel confidence other than the skilled driver.
	And how is it in the other arts? The same way. What does
	your power amount to, then? “All men pay attention[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c] to
	me.” Yes, and I pay attention to my little plate and wash it
	and wipe it out, and for the sake of my oil-flask I drive a
	peg in the wall. What follows, then? Are these things superior
	to me? No, but they render me some service, and
	therefore I pay attention to them. Again, do I not pay
	attention to my donkey? Do I not wash his feet? Do I not
	curry him? Do you not know that every man pays attention
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]60[/sup][/c]Under all ordinary circumstances the man who is being
	tested will resist the temptations of money, a maid, secrecy, reputation,
	and the like. But if, like the athlete, he be tested under
	abnormal conditions, as when drunk, or mad, or asleep, will be
	hold out against these temptations even then? If he can, he is
	indeed invincible.
	[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c]The whole passage turns on the various meanings of θεραπεύω, which include [c dimgray]serve, attend to, give medical care to,

	who pays attention to you as to a [c dimgray]man?[/c] Point him out to
	me. Who wishes to become like you? Who becomes a zealous
	follower of yours as men did of Socrates? “But I can
	cut off your head.” Well said! I had forgotten that I ought
	to pay attention to you, as to fever or cholera, and set up
	an altar to you, just as in Rome there is an altar to the God
	Fever.

	What is it, then, that disturbs and bewilders the multitude?
	Is it the tyrant and his bodyguards? How is that
	possible? Nay, far from it! It is not possible that that which
	is by nature free should be disturbed or thwarted by anything
	but itself. But it is a man’s own judgements that
	disturb him. For when the tyrant says to a man, “I will
	chain your leg,” the man who has set a high value on his
	leg replies, “Nay, have mercy upon me,” while the man
	who has set a high value on his moral purpose replies, “If it
	seems more profitable to you to do so, chain it.” “Do you
	not care?” “No, I do not care.” “I will show you that I am
	master.” “How can [c dimgray]you[/c] be my master? Zeus has set me free.
	Or do you really think that he was likely to let his own son
	be made a slave? You are, however, master of my dead
	body, take it.” “You mean, then, that when you approach
	me you will not pay attention to me?” “No, I pay attention
	only to myself. But if you wish me to say that I pay attention
	to you too, I tell you that I do so, but only as I pay attention
	to my pot.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This is not mere self-love; such is the nature of the
	animal man; everything that he does is for himself. Why,
	even the sun does everything for its own sake, and, for that
	matter, so does Zeus himself. But when Zeus wishes to be

	of gods,” you can see for yourself that he cannot achieve
	these works, or win these appellations, unless he proves
	himself useful to the common interest; and in general he
	has so constituted the nature of the rational animal man,
	that he can attain nothing of his own proper goods unless
	he contributes something to the common interest. Hence
	it follows that it can no longer be regarded as unsocial for
	a man to do everything for his own sake. For what do you
	expect? That a man should neglect himself and his own

	really expect, then, to be present when the deeds are read
	and say, ‘That is my name they have written?’ And even
	supposing you are now able to be present whenever anyone
	reads them, what will you do if you die?” “My name will
	remain after me.” “Inscribe it on a stone and it will remain

	many names of witnesses, eponymous magistrates, supervising
	officials, and the like. A priest of Augustus would naturally
	be called in often to sign formal documents in one capacity or
	another.

	[b][c dimgray]20. How the reasoning faculty contemplates itself[/c][/b]
	Every art and faculty makes certain things the special
	object of its contemplation. Now when the art or faculty
	itself is of like kind with what it contemplates, it becomes
	inevitably self-contemplative; but when it is of unlike kind,
	it cannot contemplate itself. For example, the art of
	leather-working has to do with hides, but the art itself is
	altogether different from the material of hides, wherefore
	it is not self-contemplative. Again, the art of grammar has
	to do with written speech; it is not, therefore, also itself
	written speech, is it? Not at all. For this reason it cannot
	contemplate itself. Well then, for what purpose have we
	received reason from nature? For the proper use of external
	impressions. What, then, is reason itself? Something
	composed out of a certain kind of external impressions.
	Thus it comes naturally to be also self-contemplative.
	Once more, what are the things that wisdom has been
	given us to contemplate? Things good, bad, and neither
	good nor bad. What, then, is wisdom itself? A good. And
	what is folly? An evil. Do you see, then, that wisdom inevitably
	comes to contemplate both itself and its opposite?
	Therefore, the first and greatest task of the philosopher is
	to test the impressions and discriminate between them,
	and to apply[c dimgray][sup]65[/sup][/c] none that has not been tested. You all see in
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]65[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i.e.[/c], in the sense of basing action upon only such impressions
	as have been tested and found to be trustworthy.

	the matter of coinage, in which it is felt that we have some
	interest, how we have even invented an art, and how many
	means the tester employs to test the coinage—sight, touch,
	smell, finally hearing; he throws the denarius down and
	then listens to the sound, and is not satisfied with the sound
	it makes on a single test, but, as a result of his constant
	attention to the matter, he catches the tune, like a musician.
	Thus, where we feel that it makes a good deal of
	difference to us whether we go wrong or do not go wrong,
	there we apply any amount of attention to discriminating
	between things that are capable of making us go wrong,
	but in the case of our governing principle, poor thing, we
	yawn and sleep and erroneously accept any and every external
	impression; for here the loss that we suffer does not
	attract our attention.

	When, therefore, you wish to realize how careless you
	are about the good and the evil, and how zealous you are
	about that which is indifferent, observe how you feel about
	physical blindness on the one hand, and mental delusion

	feeling as you ought about things good and things evil.

	work, and learning many things.” Well, what then? Do you
	expect it to be possible to acquire the greatest art with a

	is extremely brief. If you would know, read what Zeno has
	to say and you will see. For what is there lengthy in his
	statement: “To follow the gods is man’s end, and the essence
	of good is the proper use of external impressions?”
	Ask, “What, then, is God, and what is an external impression?
	And what is nature in the individual and nature in the
	universe?” You already have a lengthy statement. If

	Epicurus should come and say that the good ought to be
	in the flesh, again the explanation becomes lengthy, and
	you must be told what is the principal faculty within us,
	and what our substantial, and what our essential, nature is.
	Since it is not probable that the good of a snail lies in its
	shell, is it, then, probable that the good of man lies in his
	flesh? But take your own case, Epicurus; what more masterful
	faculty do you yourself possess? What is that thing
	within you which takes counsel, which examines into all
	things severally, which, after examining the flesh itself, decides
	that it is the principal matter? And why do you light a
	lamp and toil in our behalf, and write such quantities of

	[b][c dimgray]22. Of our preconceptions[/c][/b]
	Preconceptions are common to all men, and one preconception
	does not contradict another. For who among
	us does not assume that the good is profitable and something
	to be chosen, and that in every circumstance we
	ought to seek and pursue it? And who among us does
	not assume that righteousness is beautiful and becoming?
	When, then, does contradiction arise? It arises in the application
	of our preconceptions to the particular cases,
	when one person says, “He did nobly, he is brave”; another,
	“No, but he is out of his mind.” Thence arises the conflict
	of men with one another. This is the conflict between Jews
	and Syrians and Egyptians and Romans, not over the question
	whether holiness should be put before everything else
	and should be pursued in all circumstances, but whether
	the particular act of eating swine’s flesh is holy or unholy.
	This, you will find, was also the cause of conflict between
	Agamemnon and Achilles. Come, summon them before
	us. What do you say, Agamemnon? Ought not that to be
	done which is proper, and that which is noble? “Indeed it
	ought.” And what do you say, Achilles? Do you not agree
	that what is noble ought to be done? “As for me, I agree
	most emphatically with that principle.” Very well, then,
	apply your preconceptions to the particular cases. It is just
	there the conflict starts. The one says, “I ought not to be
	compelled to give back Chryseis to her father,” while the
	other says, “Indeed you ought.” Most certainly one of the

	two is making a bad application of the preconception “what
	one ought to do.” Again, the one of them says, “Very well,
	if I ought to give back Chryseis, then I ought to take from
	some one of you the prize [c dimgray]he[/c] has won,” and the other
	replies, “Would you, then, take the woman I love?” “Yes,
	the woman you love,” the first answers. “Shall I, then, be
	the only one—?” “But shall I be the only one to have
	nothing?” So a conflict arises.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, does it mean to be getting an education? It
	means to be learning how to apply the natural preconceptions
	to particular cases, each to the other in conformity
	with nature, and, further, to make the distinction, that
	some things are under our control while others are not
	under our control. Under our control are moral purpose
	and all the acts of moral purpose; but not under our control
	are the body, the parts of the body, possessions, parents,
	brothers, children, country—in a word, all that with which
	we associate. Where, then, shall we place “the good”? To
	what class of things are we going to apply it? To the class
	of things that are under our control?—What, is not health,
	then, a good thing, and a sound body, and life? Nay, and
	not even children, or parents, or country?—And who will
	tolerate you if you deny that? Therefore, let us transfer the
	designation “good” to these things. But is it possible, then,
	for a man to be happy if he sustains injury and fails to get
	that which is good?—It is not possible.—And to maintain
	the proper relations with his associates? And how can it be
	possible? For it is my nature to look out for my own interest.
	If it is my interest to have a farm, it is my interest to
	take it away from my neighbour; if it is my interest to have
	a cloak, it is my interest also to steal it from a bath. This is
	the source of wars, seditions, tyrannies, plots. And again,

	how shall I any longer be able to perform my duty towards
	Zeus? For if I sustain injury and am unfortunate, he pays
	no heed to me. And then we hear men saying, “What have
	I to do with him, if he is unable to help us?” And again,
	“What have I to do with him, if he wills that I be in such a
	state as I am now?” The next step is that I begin to hate
	him. Why, then, do we build temples to the gods, and make
	statues of them, as for evil spirits—for Zeus as for a god of
	Fever?[c dimgray][sup]67[/sup][/c] And how can he any longer be “Saviour,” and
	“Rain-bringer,” and “Fruit-giver?” And, in truth, if we set
	the nature of the good somewhere in this sphere, all these
	things follow.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, shall we do?—This is a subject of enquiry
	for the man who truly philosophizes and is in travail of
	thought. Says such a man to himself, “I do not now see what
	is the good and what is the evil; am I not mad?” Yes, but
	suppose I set the good somewhere here, among the things
	that the will controls, all men will laugh at me. Some white-haired
	old man with many a gold ring on his fingers will
	come along, and then he will shake his head and say, “Listen
	to me, my son; one ought of course to philosophize, but
	one ought also to keep one’s head; this is all nonsense. You
	learn a syllogism from the philosophers, but you know
	better than the philosophers what you ought to do.” Man,
	why, then, do you censure me, if I know? What shall I say
	to this slave? If I hold my peace, the fellow bursts with
	indignation. So I must say, “Forgive me as you would lovers;
	I am not my own master; I am mad.”

	[b][c dimgray]23. In answer to Epicurus[/c][/b]
	Even Epicurus understands that we are by nature social
	beings, but having once set our good in the husk which we
	wear, he cannot go on and say anything inconsistent with
	this. For, he next insists emphatically upon the principle
	that we ought neither to admire nor to accept anything that
	is detached from the nature of the good; and he is right in
	so doing. But how, then, can we still be social beings, if
	affection for our own children is not a natural sentiment?
	Why do you dissuade the wise man from bringing up children?
	Why are you afraid that sorrow will come to him on
	their account? What, does sorrow come to him on account
	of his house-slave Mouse?[c dimgray][sup]68[/sup][/c] Well, what does it matter to
	him if his little Mouse in his home begins to cry? Nay he
	knows, that if once a child is born, it is no longer in our
	power not to love it or to care for it. For the same reason
	Epicurus says that a man of sense does not engage in politics
	either; for he knows what the man who engages in
	politics has to do—since, of course, if you are going to live
	among men as though you were a fly among flies,[c dimgray][sup]69[/sup][/c] what is
	to hinder you? Yet, despite the fact that he knows this, he
	still has the audacity to say, “Let us not bring up children.”
	But a sheep does not abandon its own offspring, nor a wolf;
	and yet does a man abandon his? What do you wish us to
	do? Would you have us be foolish as sheep? But even they
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]68[/sup][/c]The reference here is clearly to Mys (“Mouse”), a favourite
	slave of Epicurus, who was brought up in his house, and took an
	active part in his philosophical studies, as Bentley saw (cf. [c dimgray]Trans.[/c] [c dimgray]Amer. Philol. Assoc.[/c], LII, 451). There is no evidence to support
	the common explanation that Epicurus had compared children to
	mice.
	[c dimgray][sup]69[/sup][/c]Since flies have no social organization or relationships, and
	there is nothing to compel one to live like a man, and not like an
	unsocial animal, except one’s own sense of fitness of things.

	It is difficulties that show what men are. Consequently,

	What for? some one says, So that you may become an
	Olympic victor; but that cannot be done without sweat. To
	my way of thinking no one has got a finer difficulty than
	the one which you have got, if only you are willing to make
	use of it as an athlete makes use of a young man to wrestle
	with. And now we are sending you to Rome as a scout, to
	spy out the land.[c dimgray][sup]70[/sup][/c] But no one sends a coward as a scout,
	that, if he merely hears a noise and sees a shadow anywhere,
	he may come running back in terror and report
	“The enemy is already upon us.” So now also, if you should
	come and tell us, “The state of things at Rome is fearful;
	terrible is death, terrible is exile, terrible is reviling, terrible
	is poverty; flee, sirs, the enemy is upon us!” we shall say
	to you, “Away, prophesy to yourself! Our one mistake was
	that we sent a man like you as a scout.”

	Diogenes, who before you was sent forth as a scout, has
	brought us back a different report. He says, “Death is not
	an evil, since it is not dishonourable”; he says, “Ill repute
	is a noise made by madmen.” And what a report this scout
	has made us about toil and about pleasure and about poverty!
	He says, “To be naked is better than any scarlet robe;
	and to sleep on the bare ground,” he says, “is the softest
	couch.” And he offers as a proof of each statement his own
	courage, his tranquillity, his freedom, and finally his body,
	radiant with health and hardened. “There is no enemy
	near,” says he; “all is full of peace.” How so, Diogenes?
	“Why, look!” says he, “I have not been struck with any -
	missile, have I, or received any wound? I have not fled from
	anyone, have I?” This is what it means to be a proper scout,

	of these things is my own? How, then, do we call them “my
	own?” Merely as we call the bed in the inn “my own.” If,
	then, the inn-keeper dies and leaves you the beds, you will
	have them; but if he leaves them to someone else, [c dimgray]he[/c] will
	have them, and [c dimgray]you[/c] will look for another bed. If, then, you
	do not find one, you will have to sleep on the ground; only
	do so with good courage, snoring and remembering that
	tragedies find a place among the rich and among kings and
	tyrants, but no poor man fills a tragic rôle except as a
	member of the chorus. Now the kings commence in a state

	Oedipus himself. “Nay, but so-and-so is blessed; for he has
	many companions to walk with.” So have I; I fall in line
	with the multitude and have many companions to walk
	with. But, to sum it all up: remember that the door has
	been thrown open. Do not become a greater coward than

	If all this is true and we are not silly nor merely playing

	choice, and all other things are nothing to us,” why are we
	still distressed and afraid? Over the things that we seriously
	care for no one has authority; and the things over which
	other men have authority do not concern us. What kind of
	thing have we left to discuss?—“Nay, give me directions.”
	[c dimgray][sup]77[/sup][/c]—What directions shall I give you? Has not Zeus
	given you directions? Has he not given you that which is
	your own, unhindered and unrestrained, while that which
	is not your own is subject to hindrance and restraint? What
	directions, then, did you bring with you when you came
	from him into this world, what kind of an order? Guard by
	every means that which is your own, but do not grasp at
	that which is another’s. Your faithfulness is your own, your
	self-respect is your own; who, then, can take these things
	from you? Who but yourself will prevent you from using
	them? But you, how do you act? When you seek earnestly
	that which is not your own, you lose that which is your own.
	Since you have such promptings and directions from Zeus,
	what kind do you still want from me? Am I greater than
	he, or more trustworthy? But if you keep these commands
	of his, do you need any others besides? But has he not

	How long, then, is it well to keep these precepts and
	not to break up the game? As long as it is played pleasantly.
	At the Saturnalia a king is chosen by lot; for it has been
	decided to play this game. The king gives his commands:
	“You drink, you mix wine, you sing, you go, you come.” I
	obey, so as not to be the one to break up the game. “Come,
	suppose that you are in an evil plight.” I do not so suppose;
	and who is there to compel me so to suppose? Again, we
	have agreed to play the story of Agamemnon and Achilles.
	The one who has been appointed to play the part of
	Agamemnon says to me, “Go to Achilles, and drag away
	Briseis.” I go. He says, “Come,” and I come. For as we
	behave in the matter of hypothetical proposals, so we
	ought to behave in life also.[c dimgray][sup]79[/sup][/c] “let it be night.” So be it.
	“What then? Is it day?” No, for I have accepted the assumption
	that it is night. “Let us suppose that you assume
	it to be night.” So be it. “But go on and assume that it [c dimgray]is[/c]
	night.” That is not consistent with the hypothesis. So also
	in the present case. “Let us suppose that you are unhappy.”
	So be it. “Are you, then, unfortunate?” Yes. “What then?
	Are you troubled with ill-fortune?” Yes. “But go on and
	assume that you [c dimgray]are[/c] in a wretched plight.” That is not

	[c dimgray][sup]78[/sup][/c]The idea seems to be that all these preconceptions, demonstrations,

	[c dimgray][sup]79[/sup][/c]That is, we accept our hypothesis as long as we can do so in

	How long, then, should we obey such commands? As
	long as it is beneficial, and that means, as long as I preserve
	what is becoming and consistent. Further, some men are
	unduly crabbed and have too sharp tongues and say, “I
	cannot dine at this fellow’s house, where I have to put up
	with his telling every day how we fought in Moesia: ‘I have
	told you, brother, how I climbed up to the crest of the hill;
	well now, I begin to be besieged again.’ ” But another says,
	“I would rather dine and hear him babble all he pleases.”
	And it is for you to compare these estimates; only do nothing
	as one burdened, or afflicted, or thinking that he is in
	a wretched plight; for no one forces you to this. Has some
	one made a smoke in the house? If he has made a moderate
	amount of smoke I shall stay; if too much, I go outside. For
	one ought to remember and hold fast to this, that the door
	stands open. But some one says, “Do not dwell in Nicopolis.”

	authority over [c dimgray]me.[/c] That is why Demetrius said to Nero,
	“You threaten me with death, but nature threatens you.” If
	I admire my paltry body, I have given myself away as a
	slave; if I admire my paltry property, I have given myself
	away as a slave; for at once I show thereby to my own hurt
	what I can be caught with. Just as when the snake draws in
	his head, I say, “Strike that part of him which he is protecting”;
	so do you be assured that your master will attack you
	at that point which you particularly wish to protect. If you
	remember all this, whom will you flatter or fear any more?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I wish to sit where the senators do.—Do you realize
	that you are making close quarters for yourself, that you
	are crowding yourself?—How else, then, shall I have a
	good view in the amphitheatre?—Man, do not become
	spectator and you will not be crowded. Why do you make
	trouble for yourself? Or else wait a little while, and when
	the show is over sit down among the seats of the senators
	and sun yourself. For in general remember this—that we
	crowd ourselves, we make close quarters for ourselves, that
	is to say, the decisions of our will crowd us and make us
	close quarters. Why, what is this matter of being reviled?
	Take your stand by a stone and revile it; and what effect
	will you produce? If, then, a man listens like a stone, what
	profit is there to the reviler? But if the reviler has the
	weakness of the reviled as a point of vantage, then he does
	accomplish something. “Strip him.” Why do you say [c dimgray]‘him’?[/c]
	Take his cloak and strip that off. “I have outraged you.”
	Much good may it do you! This is what Socrates practised,
	and that is why he always wore the same expression on his
	face. But we prefer to practise and rehearse anything
	rather than how to be untrammelled and free. “The philosophers

	Epictetus said, This also is a law governing hypotheses—that
	we must accept what the hypothesis or premiss
	demands. But much more important is the following law
	of life—that we must do what nature demands. For if we
	wish in every matter and circumstance to observe what is
	in accordance with nature, it is manifest that in everything
	we should make it our aim neither to avoid that which
	nature demands, nor to accept that which is in conflict with
	nature. The philosophers, therefore, exercise us first in the
	theory where there is less difficulty, and then after that lead
	us to the more difficult matters; for in theory there is nothing
	which holds us back from following what we are taught,
	but in the affairs of life there are many things which draw
	us away. He is ridiculous, then, who says that he wishes to
	begin with the latter; for it is not easy to begin with the

	children study philosophy. “Very well then, father, I go
	astray, not knowing what is incumbent upon me or what
	my duty is. Now if this is a thing that can neither be taught
	nor learned, why do you reproach me? But if it can be
	taught, teach me; and if you cannot do this, allow me to
	learn from those who profess to know. Really, what is your
	idea? That I intentionally fall into evil and miss the good?
	Far from it! What, then, is the cause of my going astray?
	Ignorance. Very well, do you not want me to put away my
	ignorance? Whom did anger ever teach the art of steering,
	or music? Do you think, then, that your anger will make
	me learn the art of living?”

	Only he can so speak who has applied himself to philosophy
	in such a spirit. But if a man reads upon the subject
	and resorts to the philosophers merely because he wants
	to make a display at a banquet of his knowledge of hypothetical
	arguments, what else is he doing but trying to win
	the admiration of some senator sitting by his side? For
	there in Rome are found in truth the great resources, while
	the riches of Nicopolis look to them like mere child’s-play.[c dimgray][sup]85[/sup][/c]
	Hence it is difficult there for a man to control his
	own external impressions, since the distracting influences
	at Rome are great. I know a certain man who clung in tears
	to the knees of Epaphroditus and said that he was in misery;
	for he had nothing left but a million and a half sesterces.
	What, then, did Epaphroditus do? Did he laugh at him

	“Poor man, how, then, [c dimgray]did[/c] you manage to keep silence?

	How [c dimgray]did[/c] you endure it?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Once when he had disconcerted the student who was
	reading the hypothetical arguments, and the one who had
	set the other the passage to read laughed at him, Epictetus
	said to the latter, “You are laughing at yourself. You did not
	give the young man a preliminary training, nor discover
	whether he was able to follow these arguments, but you
	treat him merely as a reader. Why is it, then,” he added,
	“that to a mind unable to follow a judgement upon a comple
	Xargument we entrust the assigning of praise or blame,
	or the passing of a judgement upon what is done well or
	ill? If such a person speaks ill of another, does the man in
	question pay any attention to him, or if he praises another,
	is the latter elated? when the one who is dispensing praise
	or blame is unable, in matters as trivial as these, to find the
	logical consequence? This, then, is a starting point in philosophy—a perception of the state of one’s own governing
	principle;[c dimgray][sup]86[/sup][/c] for when once a man realizes that it is weak,
	he will no longer wish to employ it upon great matters. But
	as it is, some who are unable to swallow the morsel buy a
	whole treatise and set to work to eat that. Consequently
	they throw up, or have indigestion; after that come colics
	and fluxes and fevers. But they ought first to have considered
	whether they have the requisite capacity. However, in
	a matter of theory it is easy enough to confute the man who
	does not know, but in the affairs of life a man does not
	submit himself to confutation, and we hate the person who
	has confuted us. But Socrates used to tell us not to live a
	life unsubjected to examination.[c dimgray][sup]87[/sup][/c]

	[b][c dimgray]27. In how many ways do the external impressions arise, and what aids should we have ready at hand to deal with them?[/c][/b]
	The external impressions come to us in four ways; for
	either things are, and seem so to be; or they are not, and
	do not seem to be, either; or they are, and do not seem to
	be; or they are not, and yet seem to be. Consequently, in
	all these cases it is the business of the educated man to hit
	the mark. But whatever be the thing that distresses us,
	against that we ought to bring up our reinforcements. If
	the things that distress us are sophisms of Pyrrho and the
	Academy, let us bring up our reinforcements against them;
	if they are the plausibilities of things, whereby we are led
	to think that certain things are good when they are not, let
	us seek reinforcements at that point; if the thing that distresses
	us is a habit, we should try to hunt up the reinforcements
	with which to oppose that. What reinforcements,
	then, is it possible to find with which to oppose habit? Why,
	the contrary habit. You hear the common folk saying, “That
	poor man! He is dead; his father perished, and his mother;
	he was cut off, yes, and before his time, and in a foreign
	land.” Listen to the arguments on the other side, tear yourself
	away from these expressions, set over against one habit
	the contrary habit. To meet sophistic arguments we must
	have the processes of logic and the exercise and the familiarity
	with these; against the plausibilities of things we must
	have our preconceptions clear, polished like weapons, and
	ready at hand.

	fall within the compass of our powers?[c dimgray][sup]90[/sup][/c] And where
	can I go to escape death? Show me the country, show me
	the people to whom I may go, upon whom death does not
	come; show me a magic charm against it. If I have none,
	what do you wish me to do? I cannot avoid death. Instead
	of avoiding the fear of it, shall I die in lamentation and
	trembling? For the origin of sorrow is this—to wish for
	something that does not come to pass. Therefore, if I can
	change externals according to my own wish, I change
	them; but if I cannot, I am ready to tear out the eyes of
	the man who stands in my way. For it is man’s nature not
	to endure to be deprived of the good, not to endure to
	fall into the evil. Then, finally, when I can neither change
	the circumstances, nor tear out the eyes of the man who
	stands in my way, I sit down and groan, and revile whom I
	can—Zeus and the rest of the gods; for if they do not
	care for me, what are they to me? “Yes,” you say, “But
	that will be impious of you.” What, then, shall I get that is
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]88[/sup][/c]And therefore not an evil.
	[c dimgray][sup]89[/sup][/c]A paraphrase of Homer, [c dimgray]Iliad[/c], XII.328.
	[c dimgray][sup]90[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i.e.[/c], if we cannot act as nobly as Sarpedon, we can at least
	think rationally about death, counting it no evil.

	cannot be maintained in any man. Do not these considerations

	Let the follower of Pyrrho or of the Academy come and

	from some particular part, perhaps I do not know how to
	give a reasonable answer, and both views perplex me. But

	that is, the commonly received opinion, and be on

	What is the reason that we assent to anything? The fact
	that it appears to us to be so. It is impossible, therefore, to
	assent to the thing that appears not to be so. Why? Because
	this is the nature of the intellect—to agree to what is true,
	to be dissatisfied with what is false, and to withhold judgement
	regarding what is uncertain. What is the proof of
	this? “Feel, if you can, that it is now night.” That is impossible.
	“Put away the feeling that it is day.” That is impossible.
	“Either feel or put away the feeling that the stars are
	even in number.” That is impossible. When, therefore, a
	man assents to a falsehood, rest assured that it was not his
	wish to assent to it as false; “for every soul is unwillingly
	deprived of the truth,” as Plato says;[c dimgray][sup]93[/sup][/c] it only seemed to
	him that the false was true. Well now, in the sphere of
	actions what have we corresponding to the true and the
	false here in the sphere of perceptions? Duty and what is
	contrary to duty, the profitable and the unprofitable, that
	which is appropriate to me and that which is not appropriate
	to me, and whatever is similar to these. “Cannot a man,

	But passion overmastereth sober thought?[c dimgray][sup]94[/sup][/c]
	It is because the very gratification of her passion and the
	taking of vengeance on her husband she regards as more
	profitable than the saving of her children. “Yes, but she is
	deceived.” Show her clearly that she is deceived, and she
	will not do it; but so long as you do not show it, what else
	has she to follow but that which appears to her to be true?
	Nothing. Why, then, are you angry with her, because the
	poor woman has gone astray in the greatest matters, and
	has been transformed from a human being into a viper?
	Why do you not, if anything, rather pity her? As we pity
	the blind and the halt, why do we not pity those who have
	been made blind and halt in their governing faculties?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Whoever, then, bears this clearly in mind, that the
	measure of man’s every action is the impression of his
	senses (now this impression may be formed rightly or
	wrongly; if rightly, the man is blameless; if wrongly, the
	man himself pays the penalty; for it is impossible that the
	man who has gone astray, is one person, while the man who
	suffers is another[c dimgray][sup]95[/sup][/c]),—whoever remembers this, I say, will
	not be enraged at anyone, will not be angry with anyone,
	will not revile anyone, will not blame, nor hate, nor take
	offence at anyone. So you conclude that such great and
	terrible things have their origin in this—the impression of
	one’s senses? In this and nothing else. The [c dimgray]Iliad[/c] is nothing
	but a sense-impression and a poet’s use of sense-impressions.

	among men? Just where the difference is; and if that element
	wherein the difference lies be preserved and stands
	firm and well fortified on every side, and neither his self-respect,
	nor his faithfulness, nor his intelligence be destroyed,
	then the man also is preserved; but if any of these
	qualities be destroyed or taken by storm, then the man also
	is destroyed. And it is in this sphere that the great things
	are. Did Alexander come to his great fall when the Hellenes
	assailed Troy with their ships, and when they were
	devastating the land, and when his brothers were dying?
	Not at all; for no one comes to his fall because of another’s
	deed; but what went on then was merely the destruction of
	storks’ nests. Nay, he came to his fall when he lost his
	self-respect, his faithfulness, his respect for the laws of
	hospitality, his decency of behaviour. When did Achilles
	come to his fall? When Patroclus died? Far from it; but
	when Achilles himself was enraged, when he was crying
	about a paltry damsel, when he forgot that he was there,
	not to get sweethearts, but to make war. These are the falls
	that come to mankind, this is the siege of their city, this is
	the razing of it—when their correct judgements are torn
	down, when these are destroyed.—Then when women are
	driven off into captivity, and children are enslaved, and
	when the men themselves are slaughtered, are not all these
	things evils?—Where do you get the justification for adding
	this opinion? Let me know also.—No, on the contrary,
	do [c dimgray]you[/c] let [c dimgray]me[/c] know where you get the justification for
	saying that they are not evils?—Let us turn to our standards,
	produce your preconceptions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For this is why I cannot be sufficiently astonished at
	what men do. In a case where we wish to judge of weights,
	we do not judge at haphazard; where we wish to judge what

	materials, if they be correct, make the moral purpose good,
	but if they be crooked and awry, they make it evil. This is
	the law which God has ordained, and He says, “If you wish
	any good thing, get it from yourself.” You say, “No, but from
	someone else.” Do not so, but get it from yourself. For the
	rest, when the tyrant threatens and summons me, I answer
	“Whom are you threatening?” If he says, “I will put you in

	by something else; and nothing else can overcome moral
	purpose, but it overcomes itself. For this reason too the
	law of God is most good and most just: “Let the better
	always prevail over the worse.” “Ten are better than one,”
	you say. For what? For putting in chains, for killing, for
	dragging away where they will, for taking away a man’s
	property. Ten overcome one, therefore, in the point in
	which they are better. In what, then, are they worse? If the

	You will not be able to prove this; no, nor even come
	near proving it. For this is a law of nature and of God: “Let
	the better always prevail over the worse.” Prevail in what?
	In that in which it is better. One body is stronger than
	another body; several persons are stronger than one; the
	thief is stronger than the man who is not a thief. That is
	why I lost my lamp,[c dimgray][sup]100[/sup][/c] because in the matter of keeping

	come out of the prison again.” If you have no further need
	of me in the prison, I shall come out; if you ever need me
	there again, I shall go back in. For how long? For so long
	as reason chooses that I remain with my paltry body; but
	when reason does not so choose, take it and good health to
	you! Only let me not give up my life irrationally, only let
	me not give up my life faintheartedly, or from some casual
	pretext. For again, God does not so desire; for He has need
	of such a universe, and of such men who go to and fro upon
	earth. But if He gives a signal to retreat, as He did to
	Socrates, I must obey Him who gives the signal, as I would
	a general.

	What then? Must I say these things to the multitude?
	For what purpose? Is it not sufficient for a man himself to
	believe them? For example, when the children come up to
	us and clap their hands and say, “To-day is the good Saturnalia,”[c dimgray][sup]102[/sup][/c]
	do we say to them, “All this is not good?” Not at
	all; but we too clap our hands to them. And do you too,
	therefore, when you are unable to make a man change his
	opinion, realize that he is a child and clap your hands to
	him; but if you do not want to do this, you have merely to
	hold your peace.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	All this a man ought to remember, and when he is summoned
	to meet some such difficulty, he ought to know that
	the time has come to show whether we are educated. For

	was a kind of salutation, somewhat like the kiss at Easter
	among Greek Orthodox Christians.

	“It is yours to set the task, mine to practise it well.” No, but
	you [c dimgray]do[/c] say, “Do not propose to me such-and-such a hypothetical
	syllogism, but rather such-and-such a one;[c dimgray][sup]104[/sup][/c] do
	not urge upon me such-and-such a conclusion, but rather
	such-and-such a one.” A time will soon come when the
	tragic actors will think that their masks and buskins and the
	long robe are themselves. Man, all these things you have
	as a subject-matter and a task. Say something, so that we
	may know whether you are a tragic actor or a buffoon; for
	both of these have everything but their lines in common.
	Therefore, if one should take away from him both his buskins
	and his mask, and bring him on the stage as a mere
	shade of an actor, is the tragic actor lost, or does he abide?
	If he has a voice, he abides.

	of the moral purpose either good or evil? Do I injure any

	because nobody gives them anything, and will you not
	yourself come forward and make use of what you have
	learned? For what is lacking now is not quibbles; nay, the
	books of the Stoics are full of quibbles. What, then, is the
	thing lacking now? The man to make use of them, the man
	to bear witness to the arguments by his acts. This is the
	character I would have you assume, that we may no longer
	use old examples in the school, but may have some example
	from our own time also. Whose part is it, then, to
	contemplate these matters? The part of him who devotes
	himself to learning; for man is a kind of animal that loves
	contemplation. But it is disgraceful to contemplate these
	things like runaway slaves;[c dimgray][sup]107[/sup][/c] nay, sit rather free from distractions
	and listen, now to tragic actor and now to the
	citharoede,[c dimgray][sup]108[/sup][/c] and not as those runaways do. For at the very
	moment when one of them is paying attention and praising
	the tragic actor, he takes a glance around, and then if someone
	mentions the word “master,” they are instantly all in a
	flutter and upset. It is disgraceful for men who are philosophers
	to contemplate the works of nature in this spirit. For
	what is a “master?” One man is not master of another man,
	but death and life and pleasure and hardship are his masters.
	So bring Caesar to me, if he be [c dimgray]without[/c] these things,
	and you shall see how steadfast I am. But when he comes
	[c dimgray]with[/c] them, thundering and lightening, and I am afraid of

	the runaway slave? But so long as I have, as it were, only a

	impressions of the senses, but the things which lie outside
	the province of the moral purpose admit neither the nature
	of the evil, nor the nature of the good”; what is there paradoxical
	about the contention of the philosophers, if they
	say, “Where the things that lie outside the province of the
	moral purpose are involved, there show confidence, but
	where the things that lie within the province of the moral
	purpose are involved, there show caution?” For if the evil
	lies in an evil exercise of the moral purpose, it is only in
	regard to matters of this kind that it is right to employ
	caution; but if the things which lie outside the province of
	the moral purpose and are not under our control are nothing
	to us, we ought to employ confidence in regard to them.
	And so we shall be at one and the same time both cautious
	and confident, yes, and, by Zeus, confident because of our
	caution. For because we are cautious about the things
	which are really evil, the result will be that we shall have
	confidence in regard to the things which are not of that
	nature.

	However, we act like deer: when the hinds are frightened
	by the feathers[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and run away from them, where do
	they turn, and to what do they fly for refuge as a safe
	retreat? Why, to the nets; and so they perish because they
	have confused the objects of fear with the objects of
	confidence. So it is with us also; where do we show fear?
	About the things which lie outside the province of the
	moral purpose. Again, in which do we behave with
	confidence as if there were no danger? In the things which
	lie within the province of the moral purpose. To be deceived,
	or to act impetuously, or to do something shameless,
	or with base passion to desire something, makes no

	province of the will we succeed in our aim. But where
	death, or exile, or hardship, or ignominy faces us, there we
	show the spirit of running away, there we show violent
	agitation. Therefore, as might be expected of those men
	who err in matters of the greatest concern, we transform
	our natural confidence into boldness, desperateness, recklessness,
	shamelessness, while our natural caution and self-respect
	we transform into cowardice and abjectness, full of
	fears and perturbations. For if a man should transfer his
	caution to the sphere of the moral purpose and the deeds
	of the moral purpose, then along with the desire to be
	cautious he will also at once have under his control the will
	to avoid; whereas, if he should transfer his caution to those
	matters which are not under our control and lie outside the
	province of the moral purpose, inasmuch as he is applying
	his will to avoid towards those things which are under the
	control of others, he will necessarily be subject to fear,
	instability, and perturbation. For it is not death or hardship
	that is a fearful thing, but the fear of hardship or death.
	That is why we praise the man who said

	Our confidence ought, therefore, to be turned toward

	masks appear fearful and terrible to children because of
	inexperience, in some such manner we also are affected by
	events, and this for the same reason that children are affected
	by bugbears. For what is a child? Ignorance. What
	is a child? Want of instruction. For where a child has
	knowledge, he is no worse than we are. What is death? A
	bugbear. Turn it about and learn what it is; see, it does not
	bite. The paltry body must be separated from the bit of
	spirit, either now or later, just as it existed apart from it
	before. Why are you grieved, then, if it be separated now?
	For if it be not separated now, it will be later. Why? So that
	the revolution of the universe may be accomplished;[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] for
	it has need of the things that are now coming into being,
	and the things that shall be, and the things that have been
	accomplished. What is hardship? A bugbear. Turn it about
	and learn what it is. The poor flesh is subjected to rough
	treatment, and then again to smooth. If you do not find this
	profitable, the door stands open; if you do find it profitable,
	bear it. For the door must be standing open for every
	emergency, and then we have no trouble.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, is the fruit of these doctrines? Precisely
	that which must needs be both the fairest and the most
	becoming for those who are being truly educated—tranquillity,
	fearlessness, freedom. For on these matters we
	should not trust the multitude, who say, “Only the free
	can be educated,” but rather the philosophers, who say,
	“Only the educated are free.”—How is that?—Thus: At

	this time[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] is freedom anything but the right to live as we
	wish? “Nothing else.” Tell me, then, O men, do you wish
	to live in error? “We do not.” Well, no one who lives in error
	is free. Do you wish to live in fear, in sorrow, in turmoil?
	“By no means.” Well then, no man who is in fear, or sorrow,
	or turmoil, is free, but whoever is rid of sorrows and fears
	and turmoils, this man is by the self-same course rid also
	of slavery. How, then, shall we any longer trust you, O
	dearest lawgivers? Do we allow none but the free to get an
	education? For the philosophers say, “We do not allow any
	but the educated to be free”; that is, God does not allow
	it.—When, therefore, in the presence of the praetor a man
	turns his own slave about, has he done nothing?[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]—He has
	done something.—What?—He has turned his slave about
	in the presence of the praetor.—Nothing more?—Yes, he
	is bound to pay a tax of five per cent. of the slave’s
	value.—What then? Has not the man to whom this has
	been done become free?—He has no more become free
	than he has acquired peace of mind. You, for example, who
	are able to turn others about, have [c dimgray]you[/c] no master? Have
	you not as your master money, or a mistress, or a boy
	favourite, or the tyrant, or some friend of the tyrant? If not,

	of Epictetus, under the Roman rule, it meant nothing more than the privilege to live the kind of life that one pleased under the
	authority of the Imperial government. There is a play also on the

	Since he could not have always at hand someone to test his

	habit of testing and examining himself, and was always in
	a practical way trying out some particular primary conception.
	That is what a philosopher writes; but trifling phrases,
	and “said he,” “said I”[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] he leaves to others, to the stupid or

	Socrates did not write. Still there seems to have been some doubt
	on the question (Diog. Laert. I. 16 makes the statement that he
	did not write as resting “on the authority of some”), and the style
	of writing which Epictetus here describes seems not to have been intended for publication, so that it may be possible that Socrates
	wrote copiously, but only as a philosophical exercise, and not for
	others to read.

	no trouble. For if you are willing to keep guard over those
	things which are under your direct authority and by nature
	free, and if you are satisfied with them, what else do you
	care about? For who is master of them, who can take them
	away from you? If you wish to be self-respecting and honourable,

	groan, then groan. For when you subject what is your own
	to externals, then from henceforth be a slave, and stop
	letting yourself be drawn this way and that, at one moment
	wishing to be a slave, at another not, but be either this
	or that simply and with all your mind, either a free man or
	a slave, either educated or uneducated, either a spirited
	fighting cock or a spiritless one, either endure to be beaten
	until you die, or give in at once. Far be it from you to
	receive many blows and yet at the last give in! But if that
	is disgraceful, begin this very moment to decide the question,
	“Where is the nature of good and evil to be found?
	Where truth also is. Where truth and where nature are,
	there is caution; where truth is, there is confidence, where
	nature is.”[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]

	Why, do you think that if Socrates had wished to maintain
	his external possessions he would have come forward
	and said,” Anytus and Meletus are able indeed to kill me,
	but they cannot harm me?” Was he so foolish as not to see
	that this course does not lead to that goal, but elsewhere?
	Why is it unreasonable, then, to add also a word of provocation?
	Just as my friend Heracleitus, who had an unimportant
	lawsuit about a small piece of land in Rhodes; after
	he had pointed out the justice of his claim he went on to
	the peroration in which he said,” But neither will I entreat
	you, nor do I care what your decision is going to be, and it
	is you who are on trial rather than I.” And so he ruined his

	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]These last three sentences make no satisfactory sense in
	themselves, and none of the numerous emendations which have
	been offered seem convincing, while at the same time they inter- rupt the course of the argument where they stand. It would appear,
	as Schenkl suggests, that they constitute a seriously mutilated
	section of the preceding chapter (possibly from the very
	end), which by some accident has become imbedded in an alien
	context.

	case. What is the use of acting like that? Merely make no
	entreaties, but do not add the words “Yes, and I make no
	entreaties,” unless the right time has come for you, as it
	did for Socrates, deliberately to provoke your judges. If
	you, for your part, are preparing a peroration of that sort,
	why do you mount the platform at all, why answer the
	summons?[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] For if you wish to be crucified, wait and the
	cross will come; but if reason decides that you should answer
	the summons and do your best to have what you say
	carry conviction, you must act in accordance therewith, but
	always maintaining what is your own proper character.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Looked at in this way it is also absurd to say, “Advise
	me.” What advice am I to give you? Nay, say rather, “Enable
	my mind to adapt itself to whatever comes.” Since the
	other expression is just as if an illiterate should say, “Tell
	me what to write when some name is set me to write.” For
	if I say, “Write Dio,” and then his teacher comes along and
	sets him not the name “Dio,” but “Theo,” what will happen?
	What will he write? But if you have practised writing,
	you are able also to prepare yourself for everything that is
	dictated to you; if you have not practised, what advice can
	I now offer you? For if circumstances dictate something
	different, what will you say or what will you do? Bear in
	mind, therefore, this general principle and you will not be
	at a loss for a suggestion. But if you gape open-mouthed at
	externals, you must needs be tossed up and down according
	to the will of your master. And who is your master? He
	who has authority over any of the things upon which you
	set your heart or which you wish to avoid.

	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]That is, it is a sheer waste of effort to speak in so provocative a manner as to invite condemnation. If that is what you wish,

	[b][c dimgray]3. To those who recommend persons to the Philosophers[/c][/b]
	That is an excellent answer of Diogenes to the man who
	asked for a letter of recommendation from him: “That you
	are a man,” he says, “he will know at a glance; but whether
	you are a good or a bad man he will discover if he has the
	skill to distinguish between good and bad, and if he is
	without that skill he will not discover the facts, even though
	I write him thousands of times.” For it is just as though a
	drachma asked to be recommended to someone, in order
	to be tested. If the man in question is an assayer of silver,
	you will recommend yourself. We ought, therefore, to have
	also in everyday life the sort of thing that we have in the
	case of silver, so that I may be able to say, as the assayer of
	silver says, “Bring me any drachma you please, and I will
	appraise it.” Now in the case of syllogisms I say, “Bring me
	any you please and I will distinguish for you between the
	one that is capable of analysis and the one that is not.”[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]
	How so? Because, I know how to analyze syllogisms myself;
	I have the faculty which the man must have who is
	going to appraise those who handle syllogisms properly.
	But in everyday life what do I do? Sometimes I call a thing
	good, and sometimes bad. What is the reason? The opposite
	of what was true in the case of syllogisms, namely,
	ignorance and inexperience.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]This is Wolf’s interpretation of the rare word ἀναλυτικός,
	[c dimgray]i. e.[/c], as referring to a syllogism. But Upton, Schweighäuser, and
	others take it in the sense of “a person who is capable of analyzing
	syllogisms.” The former interpretation fits the preceding sentence better, the latter the following sentence. As in § 3 the assayer of
	silver and the assayer of character are blended, so here apparently
	the transition from the syllogism to those who handle it is made
	somewhat abruptly.

	[b][c dimgray]4. To the man who had once been caught in Adultery[/c][/b]
	As Epictetus was remarking that man is born to fidelity,
	and that the man who overthrows this is overthrowing
	the characteristic quality of man, there entered one who
	had the reputation of being a scholar, and who had once
	been caught in the city in the act of adultery. But, goes
	on Epictetus, if we abandon this fidelity to which we are
	by nature born, and make designs against our neighbour’s
	wife, what are we doing? Why, what but ruining and destroying?
	Whom? The man of fidelity, of self-respect, or
	piety. Is that all? Are we not overthrowing also neighbourly
	feeling, friendship, the state? In what position are we placing
	ourselves? As what am I to treat you, fellow? As a
	neighbour, as a friend? Of what kind? As a citizen? What
	confidence am I to place in you? If you were a vessel so
	cracked that it was impossible to use you for anything, you
	would be cast forth upon the dunghills and even from
	there no one would pick you up; but if, although a man, you
	cannot fill a man’s place, what are we going to do with you?
	For, assuming that you cannot hold the place of a friend,
	can you hold that of a slave? And who is going to trust you?
	Are you not willing, therefore, that you too should be cast
	forth upon some dunghill as a useless vessel, as a piece of
	dung? For all that will you say, “Nobody cares for me, a
	scholar!”? No, for you are an evil man, and useless. It is just
	as if the wasps complained that nobody cares for them, but
	all run away from them, and, if anyone can, he strikes them
	and knocks them down. You have such a sting that you

	the theatre the common property of the citizens? When,
	therefore, they are seated there, go, if it so pleases you, and
	throw someone of them out of his seat. In the same way
	women also are by nature common property. But when the
	law-giver, like a host at a banquet, has apportioned them,
	are you not willing like the rest to look for your own portion
	instead of filching away and glutting your greed upon that
	which is another’s? “But I am a scholar and understand

	[b][c dimgray]5. How are magnanimity and carefulness compatible?[/c][/b]
	Materials are indifferent, but the use which we make
	of them is not a matter of indifference. How, therefore,
	shall a man maintain steadfastness and peace of mind, and
	at the same time the careful spirit and that which is neither
	reckless nor negligent? If he imitates those who play at
	dice. The counters are indifferent, the dice are indifferent;
	how am I to know what is going to fall? But to make a
	careful and skilful use of what has fallen, that is now my
	task.[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] In like manner, therefore, the principal task in life
	is this: distinguish matters and weigh them one against another,
	and say to yourself, “Externals are not under my
	control; moral choice is under my control. Where am I to
	look for the good and the evil? Within me, in that which is
	my own.” But in that which is another’s never employ the
	words “good” or “evil,” or “benefit” or “injury,” or anything
	of the sort.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What then? Are these externals to be used carelessly?
	Not at all. For this again is to the moral purpose an evil
	and thus unnatural to it. They must be used carefully, because
	their use is not a matter of indifference, and at the
	same time with steadfastness and peace of mind, because
	the material is indifferent. For in whatever really concerns
	us, there no man can either hinder or compel me. The
	attainment of those things in which I can be hindered or
	compelled is not under my control and is neither good or

	bad, but the use which I make of them is either good or
	bad, and that is under my control. It is, indeed, difficult to
	unite and combine these two things—the carefulness of
	the man who is devoted to material things and the steadfastness
	of the man who disregards them, but it is not
	impossible. Otherwise happiness were impossible. But we
	act very much as though we were on a voyage. What is
	possible for me? To select the helmsman, the sailors, the
	day, the moment. Then a storm comes down upon us. Very
	well, what further concern have I? For my part has been
	fulfilled. The business belongs to someone else, that is, the
	helmsman. But, more than that, the ship goes down. What,
	then, have I to do? What I can; that is the only thing I
	do; I drown without fear, neither shrieking nor crying out
	against God, but recognizing that what is born must also
	perish. For I am not eternal, but a man; a part of the whole,
	as an hour is part of a day. I must come on as the hour and
	like an hour pass away. What difference, then, is it to me
	how I pass away, whether by drowning or by a fever? For
	by something of the sort I must needs pass away.

	This is what you will see skilful ball players doing also.
	None of them is concerned about the ball as being something
	good or bad, but about throwing and catching it.
	Accordingly, form has to do with that, skill with that, and
	speed, and grace; where I cannot catch the ball even if I
	spread out my cloak, the expert catches it if I throw. Yet if
	we catch or throw the ball in a flurry or in fear, what fun is
	there left, and how can a man be steady, or see what comes
	next in the game? But one player will say “Throw!” another,

	that sense, then, Socrates knew how to play ball.
	How so? He knew how to play in the lawcourt. “Tell me,”
	says he, “Anytus, what do you mean when you say that I
	do not believe in God. In your opinion who are the
	[c dimgray]daemones?[/c][c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] Are they not either the offspring of the gods
	or a hybrid race, the offspring of men and gods?” And when
	Anytus had agreed to that statement Socrates went on,
	“Who, then, do you think, can believe that mules exist, but
	not asses?”[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] In so speaking he was like a man playing ball.
	And at that place and time what was the ball that he was
	playing with? Imprisonment, exile, drinking poison, being
	deprived of wife, leaving children orphans. These were the
	things with which he was playing, but none the less he
	played and handled the ball in good form. So ought we also
	to act, exhibiting the ball-player’s carefulness about the
	game, but the same indifference about the object played
	with, as being a mere ball. For a man ought by all means
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c]A variety of ball-playing among the Greeks consisted in
	tossing the ball back and forth between partners or teammates
	(often in response to a call, Plutarch, [c dimgray]Alex.[/c] 39.3), while their opponents
	tried to get the ball away (Galen, [c dimgray]de Parvae Pilae Exercitio,[/c]
	2), somewhat as in the American games Keep-away and Basket-ball.
	An interesting series of calls used in the game is given by
	Antiphanes in [c dimgray]Athenaeus[/c], I.15a, one of which, ἄνω, “Up!”, may be
	the short form of the positive of the call given in the text here. On
	the ball-teams at Sparta see M. N. Tod, [c dimgray]Annual of the British
	School at Athens,[/c] 1903–4, 63 ff. Possibly one might read ἀναβάλῃ,
	“Don’t wait!” or “Don’t stall!” which would fit the context" admirably, although the use of βάλλω in different senses within
	the same sentence would appear rather strange.
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]A term originally used of any spiritual power, and in early
	Greek often of the greatest gods, but in classical and Hellenistic
	times coming generally to be restricted to spiritual essences of a
	lower rank. There is no adequate English word which can be used
	in translation.
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]A free paraphrase of the argument in Plato’s
	[c dimgray]Apology[/c], 26e ff., obviously from memory, for the questions were
	put by Socrates, not to Anytus, but to Meletus.—Socrates has
	been charged with denying the existence of the gods, but at the
	same time introducing new [c dimgray]daemones.[/c] If, however, [c dimgray]daemones[/c] are
	merely offspring of gods, then it is impossible that both charges
	could be true of any sane man.

	yet the judgement about it is not indifferent, but
	is either knowledge, or opinion, or delusion. In like manner,
	although life is a matter of indifference, the use which
	you make of it is not a matter of indifference. Therefore,
	when someone tells you, “These things also are indifferent,”
	do not become careless, and when someone exhorts
	you to be careful, do not become abject and overawed by
	material things. It is good also to know one’s own training

	and capacity, so that where you have had no training you
	may keep quiet and not be annoyed if some other persons
	outshine you in those matters. For you in your turn will
	expect to outshine them in syllogisms, and if they are annoyed
	at that, you will console them by saying, “I have
	learned this, and you have not.” So also in a case where
	some acquired skill is needed, do not seek that which only
	practice can give, but leave that to those who have acquired
	the knack, and be content yourself to remain steadfast.

	when I find the door closed, I must either go away or crawl
	in at the window.” “But go and [c dimgray]do[/c] speak to him.” “I do so
	speak.” “In what manner?” “In no abject spirit.” “But you
	did not get what you wanted.” Surely that was not your

	For example, why do heads of grain grow? Is it not that
	they may also become dry? But when they become dry, is
	it not that they may also be harvested? Since they do not
	grow for themselves alone. If, therefore, they had feeling,
	ought they to pray that they should never at all be harvested?
	But never to be harvested at all is a curse for heads
	of grain. In like manner I would have you know that in the
	case of men as well it is a curse never to die; it is like never
	growing ripe, never being harvested. But, since we are
	ourselves those who must both be harvested and also be
	aware of the very fact that we are being harvested, we are
	angry on that account. For we neither know who we are,
	nor have we studied what belongs to man, as horsemen
	study what belongs to horses. But Chrysantas, when he was
	on the point of striking the foe, refrained because he heard
	the bugle sounding the recall;[c dimgray][sup]26[/sup][/c] it seemed so much more
	profitable to him to do the bidding of his general than to
	follow his own inclination. Yet no one of us is willing, even
	when necessity calls, to obey her readily, but what we suffer
	we suffer with fears and groans, and call it “circumstances.”
	What do you mean by “circumstances,” man? If
	you call “circumstances” your surroundings, all things are
	“circumstances”; but if you use the word of hardships, what
	hardship is involved when that which has come into being
	is destroyed? The instrument of destruction is a sword, or
	a wheel,[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c] or the sea, or a tile, or a tyrant. What concern is
	it to you by what road you descend to the House of Hades?

	“I run the risk of my life in Caesar’s presence.” But do
	I not run a risk by living in Nicopolis, where there are so

	when you cross the Adriatic? Do you not risk your life?
	“But I also risk my opinion at court.” Your own opinion?
	How so? Why, who can compel you to opine anything
	against your will? But do you mean some other man’s opinion?
	And what kind of risk is it of yours that others should
	entertain false opinions? “But I run the risk of banishment.”
	What is banishment? To be somewhere else than in

	If it is to your good, you will go; if not, you have a place to

	much to have listened to so many lectures, and to have
	written so many exercises, and to have sat so long at the
	side of a little old man, who was not worth very much
	himself.” Only remember that distinction which is drawn
	between what is yours and what is not yours. Never lay
	claim to anything that is not your own. A platform and a

	keep it the same, in either place. And then we shall be
	emulating Socrates, when we are able to write paeans in

	I wonder if we should have endured it, had some one else

	[b][c dimgray]7. How should one employ Divination?[/c][/b]
	Because we employ divination when there is no occasion
	for it, many of us neglect many of the duties of life. For
	what can the diviner see that is of greater import than
	death,[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c] or danger, or illness, or in general such things as
	these? If, then, it becomes necessary for me to risk my life
	for my friend, and if it becomes my duty even to die for
	him, where do I find beyond that any occasion to employ
	divination? Have I not within me the diviner that has told
	me the true nature of good and of evil, that has set forth
	the signs characteristic of both of them? What further use
	have I, then, of entrails, or of birds? But when he says, “It
	is expedient for you,” do I accept it? Why, does he know
	what is expedient? Does he know what is good? Has he
	learned the signs characteristic of things good and things
	evil, as he has the signs characteristic of entrails? For if he
	knows the signs characteristic of these, he knows also those
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c]The idea seems to be: We go to a diviner in order to find out
	what acts to avoid if we would escape evils to ourselves. But the
	things in life that are accounted our chief ills are death, danger, illness, and the like. These evils one must sometimes, in self-respect,
	accept, and they are in fact, not evils at all. Hence the petty
	things about which men consult the diviner fall into insignificance.

	it is for you to tell me what is indicated by signs—life or
	death, poverty or wealth; but whether these things are
	expedient or inexpedient, am I going to ask of you? Why
	don’t you speak on points of grammar?[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c] Well then, on
	[c dimgray]this[/c] matter, in which we mortals are all astray and in conflict
	with one another, you [c dimgray]do[/c] speak? Wherefore, that was
	an admirable answer which the woman gave who wished to
	send a boatload of supplies to Gratilla after she had
	been exiled. To a man who said, “Domitian will confiscate
	them,” she replies, “I should rather have him confiscate
	them than myself fail to send them.”

	What, then, induces us to employ divination so constantly?
	Cowardice, fear of the consequences. This is why
	we flatter the diviners, saying: “Master, shall I inherit my
	father’s property?” “Let us see; let us offer a sacrifice about
	that matter.” “Yes, master, as fortune wills.” Then if the
	diviner says, “You will inherit the property,” we thank him
	as though we had received the inheritance from [c dimgray]him.[/c] That
	is why they in their turn go on making mock of us. Well,
	what then? We ought to go to them without either desire
	or aversion, just as the wayfarer asks the man who meets
	him which of two roads leads to his destination, without
	any desire to have the right-hand road lead there any more
	than the left-hand road; for he does not care to travel one
	particular road of the two, but merely the one that leads to
	his destination. So also we ought to go to God as a guide,
	making use of Him as we make use of our eyes; we do
	not call upon them to show us such-and-such things by

	God is helpful; but the good also is helpful. It would

	found to be where we find that of God to be. What, then,
	is the true nature of God? Flesh? Far from it! Land? Far
	from it! Fame? Far from it! It is intelligence, knowledge,
	right reason. Here, therefore, and only here, shall you seek
	the true nature of the good. Surely you do not seek it at all
	in a plant, do you? No. Nor in an irrational creature? No.
	If, then, you seek it in that which is rational, why do you
	keep on seeking it somewhere else than in that which differentiates
	the rational from the irrational? Plants are incapable
	of dealing even with external impressions; for that
	reason you do not speak of the “good” in referring to them.
	The good requires, therefore, the faculty of using external
	impressions. Can that be all that it requires? For, if that be
	all, then you must assert that things good, and happiness
	and unhappiness, are to be found in the other animals as
	well as in man. But, as a matter of fact, you do not so assert,
	and you are right; for even if they have in the highest
	degree the faculty of using external impressions, still they

	do not have the faculty of understanding, at all events, their

	they are born to serve others, and are not themselves of

	immortal, or ageless, or exempt from disease? No, but one
	who dies like a god, who bears disease like a god. This is
	what I have; this is what I can do; but all else I neither have
	nor can do. I will show you the sinews of a philosopher.
	What do you mean by sinews? A desire that fails not of
	achievement, an aversion proof against encountering what
	it would avoid, an appropriate choice, a thoughtful purpose,
	a well-considered assent. This is what you shall see.

	animal, someone says. To begin with, from what are we distinguished
	by the rational element? From the wild beasts.
	And from what else? From sheep and the like. See to it,
	then, that you never act like a wild beast; if you do, you will

	do, the man in you is destroyed in this way also. Well, when
	do we act like sheep: When we act for the sake of the belly,
	or of our sex-organs, or at random, or in a filthy fashion, or
	without due consideration, to what level have we degenerated?
	To the level of sheep. What have we destroyed? The
	reason. When we act pugnaciously, and injuriously, and
	angrily, and rudely, to what level have we degenerated? To
	the level of the wild beasts. Well, the fact is that some of
	us [c dimgray]are[/c] wild beasts of a larger size, while others are little
	animals, malignant and petty, which give us occasion to say,
	“Let it be a lion that devours me!”[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c] By means of all these
	actions the profession of a man is destroyed. For when is
	a complex thing preserved? When it fulfils its profession;
	consequently, the salvation of a complex thing is to be
	composed of parts that are true. When is a discrete[c dimgray][sup]39[/sup][/c] thing
	preserved? When it fulfils its profession. When are flutes,
	a lyre, a horse, a dog preserved? What is there to be surprised
	at, then, if a man also is preserved in the same way
	and in the same way destroyed? Now deeds that correspond
	to his true nature strengthen and preserve each particular
	man; carpentry does that for the carpenter, grammatical
	studies for the grammarian. But if a man acquires
	the habit of writing ungrammatically, his art must necessarily
	be destroyed and perish. So modest acts preserve
	the modest man, whereas immodest acts destroy him; and
	faithful acts preserve the faithful man while acts of the
	opposite character destroy him. And again, acts of the opposite

	That is why the philosophers admonish us not to be
	satisfied with merely learning, but to add thereto practice
	also, and then training. For in the course of years we have
	acquired the habit of doing the opposite of what we learn
	and have in use opinions which are the opposite of the
	correct ones. If, therefore, we do not also put in use the
	correct opinions, we shall be nothing but the interpreters
	of other men’s judgements. For who is there among us here
	and now that cannot give a philosophical discourse about
	good and evil? It will run like this: Of things that be, some
	are good, others evil, and others indifferent; now good
	things are virtues and everything that partakes in the virtues;
	evil are the opposite; while indifferent are wealth,
	health, reputation. Then, if we are interrupted in the midst
	of our speech by some unusually loud noise, or if someone
	in the audience laughs at us, we are upset. Where, you
	philosopher, are the things you are talking about? Where
	did you get what you were just saying? From your lips, and
	that is all. Why, then, do you pollute the helpful principles
	that are not your own? Why do you gamble about matters
	of the very utmost concern? For to store away bread and
	wine in a pantry is one thing, and to eat them is another.
	What is eaten is digested, distributed, becomes sinews,
	flesh, bones, blood, a good complexion, easy breathing.
	What is stored away you can readily take and show whenever
	you please, but you get no good from it except in so far
	as you are reputed to possess it. For how much better is it

	to set forth these principles than those of other schools of
	thought? Sit down now and given a philosophical discourse
	upon the principles of Epicurus, and perhaps you will discourse
	more effectively than Epicurus himself. Why, then,
	do you call yourself a Stoic, why do you deceive the multitude,
	why do you act the part of a Jew,[c dimgray][sup]40[/sup][/c] when you are a
	Greek? Do you not see in what sense men are severally
	called Jew, Syrian, or Egyptian? For example, whenever
	we see a man halting between two faiths, we are in the
	habit of saying, “He is not a Jew, he is only acting the part.”
	But when he adopts the attitude of mind of the man who
	has been baptized and has made his choice, then he both
	is a Jew in fact and is also called one. So we also are counterfeit
	“baptists,” ostensibly Jews, but in reality something
	else, not in sympathy with our own reason, far from applying
	the principles which we profess, yet priding ourselves
	upon them as being men who know them. So, although we
	are unable even to fulfil the profession of man, we take on
	the additional profession of the philosopher—so huge a
	burden! It is as though a man who was unable to raise ten
	pounds wanted to lift the stone of Aias.[c dimgray][sup]41[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]40[/sup][/c]It would appear (especially from the expression “counterfeit
	‘baptists’” below) that Epictetus is here speaking really of the
	Christians, who were in his time not infrequently confused with
	the Jews. (But it should be observed that the text translated here
	is an emendation, for the MS. says “the part of Greeks when you
	are a Jew,” which may possibly be defended on the understanding
	that, in the parlance of Epictetus, a Jew is one who does not follow
	reason as his sole guide.) The sense of this much vexed passage I take to be: True Jews
	([c dimgray]i.e.[/c] Christians) are a very marked class of men because of the
	rigorous consistency between their faith and their practice. But
	there are some who for one reason or another (possibly in order
	to avail themselves of the charity which the Christians dispensed
	to the poor, as Schweighäuser suggests,—like the so-called “rice
	Christians”) profess a faith which they do not practise. It is this
	class, then, which Epictetus has in mind when he bitterly calls
	himself and his pupils “counterfeit ‘baptists.’ ”

	[b][c dimgray]10. How is it possible to discover a man’s duties from the designations which he bears?[/c][/b]
	Consider who you are. To begin with, a Man; that is,
	one who has no quality more sovereign than moral choice,
	but keeps everything else subordinate to it, and this moral
	choice itself free from slavery and subjection. Consider,
	therefore, what those things are from which you are separated
	by virtue of the faculty of reason. You are separated
	from wild beasts, you are separated from sheep. In addition
	to this you are a citizen of the world, and a part of it,
	not one of the parts destined for service, but one of primary
	importance;[c dimgray][sup]42[/sup][/c] for you possess the faculty of understanding
	the divine administration of the world, and of
	reasoning upon the consequences thereof. What, then, is
	the profession of a citizen? To treat nothing as a matter of
	private profit, not to plan about anything as though he were
	a detached unit, but to act like the foot or the hand, which,
	if they had the faculty of reason and understood the constitution
	of nature, would never exercise choice or desire
	in any other way but by reference to the whole. Hence the
	philosophers well say that if the good and excellent man
	knew what was going to happen, he would help on the
	processes of disease and death and maiming, because he
	would realize that this allotment comes from the orderly
	arrangements of the whole, and the whole is more sovereign
	than the part, and the state more sovereign than the
	citizen. But as it is, seeing that we do not know beforehand
	what is going to happen, it is our duty to cleave to that
	which is naturally more fit to be chosen, since we are born
	for this purpose.

	own as belonging to his father, to be obedient to him in all
	things, never to speak ill of him to anyone else, nor to say
	or do anything that will harm him, to give way to him in

	Next, if you sit in the town council of some city, remember

	duly considered, always suggests the acts that are appropriate
	to it. But if you go off and speak ill of your brother,
	I say to you, “You have forgotten who you are and what
	your designation is.” Why, if you were a smith and used
	your hammer amiss, you would have forgotten the smith
	you were; but if you forgot the brother you are, and become
	an enemy instead of a brother, will you seem to
	yourself to have exchanged nothing for nothing? And if,
	instead of being a man, a gentle and social being, you have

	animal, have you lost nothing? What, must you lose a bit
	of pelf so as to suffer damage, and does the loss of nothing
	else damage a man? Yet, if you lost your skill in the use of
	language or in music, you would regard the loss of it as
	damage; but if you are going to lose self-respect and dignity
	and gentleness, do you think that does not matter? And yet
	those former qualities are lost from some external cause
	that is beyond the power of our will, but these latter are
	lost through our own fault; and it is neither noble to have
	nor disgraceful to lose these former qualities, but not to
	have these latter, or having had them to lose them, is a
	disgrace and a reproach and a calamity. What is lost by the
	victim of unnatural lust? His manhood. And by the agent?
	Beside a good many other things he also loses his manhood
	no less than the other. What does the adulterer lose? He
	loses the man of self-respect that was, the man of self-control,
	the gentleman, the citizen, the neighbour. What does
	the man lose who is given to anger? Something else. Who is
	given to fear? Something else. No one is evil without loss
	and damage. Furthermore, if you look for your loss in pelf,
	all those whom I have just mentioned suffer neither injury
	nor loss; nay, if it so chance, they even get gain and
	profit, when, through some of their deeds just mentioned,
	they also acquire pelf. But observe that if you make paltry
	pelf your standard for everything, not even the man
	who loses his nose will in your eyes have suffered an injury.—“
	Oh yes, he has,” someone says, “for his body is
	mutilated.”—Come now, and does the man who has lost
	his entire sense of smell lose nothing? Is there, then, no
	such thing as a faculty of the mind, the possession of which

	means gain to a man, and the loss, injury?—What faculty
	do you mean? Have we not a natural sense of self-respect?—
	We have.—Does not the man who destroys this
	suffer a loss, is he not deprived of something, does he not
	lose something that belonged to him? Doe we not have a
	natural sense of fidelity, a natural sense of affection, a natural
	sense of helpfulness, a natural sense of keeping our
	hands off one another? Shall, therefore, the man who allows
	himself to suffer loss in such matters, be regarded as
	having suffered neither injury nor loss?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Well, what then? Am I not to injure the man who has
	injured me?—First consider what injury is, and call to
	mind what you have heard the philosophers say. For if the
	good lies in moral purpose, and the evil likewise in moral
	purpose, see if what you are saying does not come to something
	like this, “Well, what then? Since so-and-so has injured
	himself by doing me some wrong, shall I not injure
	myself by doing him some wrong?” Why, then, do we not
	represent the case to ourselves in some such light as that?
	Instead of that, where there is some loss affecting our body
	or our property, there we count it injury; but is there no
	injury where the loss affects our moral purpose? For the
	man who has been deceived or who has done some wrong
	has no pain in his head, or his eye, or his hip, neither does
	he lose his land. But these are the things we care for and
	nothing else; yet the question whether we are going to have
	a moral purpose characterized by self-respect and good
	faith, or by shamelessness and bad faith, does not so much
	as begin to disturb us, except only in so far as we make it
	a topic of trivial discussion in the classroom. Therefore, so
	far as our trivial discussions go, we do make some progress,
	but, apart from them, not even the very least.

	[b][c dimgray]11. What is the beginning of philosophy?[/c][/b]
	The beginning of philosophy with those who take it up
	as they should, and enter in, as it were, by the gate, is a
	consciousness of a man’s own weakness and impotence
	with reference to the things of real consequence in life.
	For we come into being without any innate concept of a
	right-angled triangle, or of a half-tone musical interval, but
	by a certain systematic method of instruction we are taught
	the meaning of each of these things, and for that reason
	those who do not know them also do not fancy that they
	do. But, on the other hand, who has come into being without
	an innate concept of what is good and evil, honourable
	and base, appropriate and inappropriate, and happiness,
	and of what is proper and falls to our lot, and what we ought
	to do and what we ought not to do? Wherefore, we all use
	these terms and endeavour to adapt our preconceptions
	about them to the individual instances. “He has done well,
	as he ought, or as he ought not; he has been unfortunate,
	or fortunate; he is a wicked man, or he is a just man”—who
	of us refrains from expressions of this kind? Who of us
	waits before he uses them until he has learned what they
	mean, as those who have no knowledge of lines or sounds
	wait before they use the terms relating to them? The reason
	is that we come into the world with a certain amount
	of instruction upon this matter already given us, as it were,
	by nature, and that starting with this we have added thereto
	our opinion.—Yes, by Zeus, for do I in my own case not
	have by gift of nature knowledge of what is noble and base;
	do I not have a concept of the matter?—You do.—Do I not
	apply it to individual instances?—You do.—Do I not, then,

	upon which they are agreed, but then, because they
	make an unsuitable application of them, get into disputes.
	Since if, in addition to having the principles themselves,
	they really possessed also the faculty of making suitable
	application of the same, what could keep them from being
	perfect? But now, since you think that you can also apply
	your preconceptions suitably to the individual cases, tell

	thinks?[c dimgray][sup]44[/sup][/c] Nay, how is it possible for conflicting opinions to
	be right? Consequently, not all opinions are right.—But
	are [c dimgray]our[/c] opinions right? Why ours, rather than those of the
	Syrians; why ours, rather than those of the Egyptians; why
	ours, rather than my own, or those of so-and-so?—There
	is no reason why.—Therefore, the opinion which each man
	holds is not a sufficient criterion for determining the truth;
	for also in the case of weights and measures we are not
	satisfied with the mere appearance, but we have invented
	a certain standard to test each. In the present case, then,
	is there no standard higher than opinion? And yet how can
	it be possible that matters of the utmost consequence
	among men should be undeterminable and undiscoverable.—
	Therefore, there [c dimgray]is[/c] some standard.—Then why do
	we not look for it and find it, and when we have found it
	thenceforth use it unswervingly, not so much as stretching
	out our finger without it? For this is something, I think, the
	discovery of which frees from madness those who use only
	opinion as the measure of all things, so that thenceforward,
	starting with certain principles that are known and clearly
	discriminated, we may use in the judgement of specific
	cases an organically articulated system of preconceived
	ideas.

	What subject has arisen that we wish to investigate?
	—Pleasure.—Subject it to the standard, put it into the
	balance. Should the good be the sort of thing that we can
	properly have confidence and trust in?—It should.—Can
	we properly have confidence, then, in something that is
	insecure?—No.—Pleasure contains no element of security,

	good. But if you are not endowed with keen eyesight and
	if one balance is not enough for you, bring another. Can
	one properly feel elated over the good?—Yes.—Can one
	properly feel elated, then, over the moment’s pleasure?
	See that you do not say that it is proper; if you do, I shall

	And so are matters judged and weighed, if we have the
	standards ready with which to test them; and the task of

	known is the task of the good and excellent man.

	What a man ought to learn before he will know how to
	conduct an argument has been precisely defined by the
	philosophers of our school; but as to the proper use of what
	we have learned we are still utterly inexperienced. At all
	events, give to anyone of us you please some layman with
	whom to carry on an argument; he will find no way of
	dealing with him, but after moving the man a little, in case
	the latter thwarts him, our man gives up trying to handle
	him, and thereafter either reviles him, or laughs him to
	scorn, and remarks, “He is a mere layman; it is impossible
	to do anything with him.” But the real guide, whenever he
	finds a person going astray, leads him back to the right road,
	instead of leaving him with a scornful laugh or an insult.

	So also do you show him the truth and you will see that he

	How did Socrates act? He used to force the man who
	was arguing with him to be his witness, and never needed
	any other witness. That is why he could say, “I can dispense
	with all the others, and am always satisfied to have my
	fellow-disputant for a witness; and the votes of the rest I
	do not take, but only that of my fellow-disputant.”[c dimgray][sup]45[/sup][/c] For he
	used to make so clear the consequences which followed
	from the concepts, that absolutely everyone realized the
	contradiction involved and gave up the battle. “And so does
	the man who feels envy rejoice in it?”[c dimgray][sup]46[/sup][/c]—“Not at all; but
	he experiences pain rather than joy.” (By the contradiction
	in terms he has moved the other party to the argument.)
	“Very well, does envy seem to you to be feeling of pain at
	evils? And yet what envy is there of evils?” (Consequently,
	he has made his opponent say that envy is a feeling of pain
	at good things.) “Very well, would a man feel envy about
	matters that did not concern him in the least?”—“Not at
	all.” And so he filled out and articulated the concept, and
	after that went his way; he did not start in by saying, “Define
	envy for me,” and then, when the other had defined it,
	remark, “That is a bad definition you have made, for the
	definition term does not fit the subject defined.” “Those
	are technical terms, and for that reason wearisome to the
	layman and hard for him to follow, and yet we are unable

	could himself follow, and so, by the assistance of his
	own external impressions, be able to accept or reject some
	proposition—we are absolutely unable to move him by
	their use. The result is that, recognizing this incapacity
	of ours, we naturally refrain from attempting the matter,
	those of us, I mean, who are at all cautious. But the rash
	multitude of men, when once they have let themselves in
	for something of this sort, get confused themselves and
	confuse others, and finally, after reviling their opponents
	and being themselves reviled, they walk away.

	Now this was the first and most characteristic thing
	about Socrates, that he never got wrought up during an
	argument, never used any term of abuse or insolence, but
	endured the abuse of others, and put an end to strife. If
	you wish to know how great was the faculty he had in this
	field, read the [c dimgray]Symposium[/c] of Xenophon, and you will see
	how many cases of strife he settled. Therefore, and with
	good reason, among the poets also very high praise has
	been accorded to the following sentiment:

	“Soon doth he shrewdly make an end of a quarrel

	Well, what then? Nowadays this activity is not a very
	safe one, and especially so in Rome. For the man who
	engages in it will clearly be under obligation not to do it in
	a corner, but he must go up to some rich person of consular
	rank, if it so chance, and ask him, “You there, can you tell
	to whose care you have entrusted your horses?” “I can,
	indeed,” answers the man. “Is it, then, some chance comer,

	When I see a man in anxiety, I say to myself, What can
	it be that this fellow wants? For if he did not want something
	that was outside of his control, how could he still
	remain in anxiety? That is why the citharoede when singing
	all alone shows no anxiety, but does so when he enters the
	theatre, even though he has a very beautiful voice and plays
	the cithara admirably; for he does not wish merely to sing
	well, but also to win applause, and that is no longer under
	his control. Accordingly, where he has skill, there he shows
	confidence. Set before him any layman that you please, and
	the musician pays no attention to him; but in a matter of
	which he has no knowledge, and which he has never studied,
	there he is in anxiety. What is the meaning of this?
	Why, he simply does not know what a crowd is, or the
	applause of a crowd; to be sure, he has learned how to
	strike the lowest and the highest strings on the cithara, but
	what the praise of the multitude is, and what function it
	has in life, that he neither knows nor has studied. Hence
	he must needs tremble and turn pale.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now then, I cannot say that the man is not a citharoede,
	when I see anyone in a state of fear, but I can say something
	else of him, and, indeed, not one thing only, but a number
	of things. And first of all, I call him a stranger and say: This
	man does not know where in the world he is, but though
	he has been living here so long a time, he is ignorant of the
	laws of the city and its customs, what he is allowed to do
	and what he is not allowed to do. Nay more, he has never
	even called in a lawyer to tell him and explain to him what
	are the usages conformable with law; yet he does not write
	a will without knowing how he ought to write it or else

	calling in an expert, nor does he just casually affix his seal
	to a bond or give a written guarantee; but without the
	services of a lawyer he exercises desire and aversion and
	choice and design and purpose. How do I mean “without
	the services of a lawyer?” Why, he does not know that he
	is wishing for things that are not vouchsafed him, and wishing
	to avoid the inevitable, and he does not know either
	what is his own or what is another’s. Did he but know, he
	would never feel hindered, never constrained, would not
	be anxious. How could he? Is any man in fear about things
	that are not evil?—No.—What then? Is he in fear about
	things that are evil, indeed, but that are in his own power
	to prevent?—Not at all.—If, then, things indifferent are
	neither good nor bad, but all matters of moral purpose are
	under our control, and no man can either take them away
	from us, or bring upon us such of them as we do not wish,
	what room is there left for anxiety? Yet we are anxious
	about our wretched body, about our trifling estate, about
	what Caesar will think, but are anxious about none of the
	things that are within us. We are not anxious about not
	conceiving a false opinion, are we?—No, for that is under
	my control.—Or about making a choice contrary to nature?—
	No, not about this, either.—Then, whenever you
	see a man looking pale, just as the physician judging from
	the complexion says, “This man’s spleen is affected, and
	this man’s liver,” so do you also say, “This man’s desire and
	aversion are affected, he is not getting along well, he is
	feverish.” For there is nothing else that changes a man’s
	complexion, or makes him tremble, or his teeth to chatter,
	or to

	That is why Zeno was not anxious when he was about to
	meet Antigonus; for over none of the things that Zeno
	regarded highly did Antigonus have power, and what Antigonus
	did have power over Zeno cared nothing about.
	But Antigonus was anxious when he was about to meet
	Zeno, and very naturally so; for he wanted to please him,
	and that lay outside of his control; yet Zeno did not care
	about pleasing [c dimgray]him,[/c] any more than any other artist cares
	about pleasing one who has no knowledge of his art.

	Do I care to please you? What do I gain thereby? For
	do you know the standards according to which man is
	judged by man? Have you been concerned to know what
	a good man is, and what an evil man, and how each becomes
	what he is? Why, then, are you not a good man
	yourself?—How do you make out, he answers, that I am
	not a good man?—Why, because no good man grieves or
	groans, no good man laments, no good man turns pale and
	trembles, or asks, “How will he receive me? How will he
	listen to me?” You slave! He will receive you and listen to
	you as seems best to [c dimgray]him.[/c] Why, then, are you concerned
	about things that are not your own? Now is it not his own
	fault if he gives a bad reception to what you have to
	say?—Of course.—Is it possible for one man to make the
	mistake and yet another suffer the harm?—No.—Why,
	then, are you anxious over what is not your own?—That is
	all very well, but I am anxious over how I shall speak to

	please?—Yes, but I am afraid that I shall be disconcerted.—
	You are not afraid of being disconcerted when

	to read something, would you not feel the same way about
	it?—Quite the same.—What is the reason? Why, because
	every art has an element of strength and confidence inside
	its own field. Have you, then, not practised speaking? And
	what else did you practise in your school?—Syllogisms and
	arguments involving equivocal premisses.—To what end?
	Was it not to enable you to conduct an argument skilfully?
	And does not “skilfully” mean seasonably and securely and
	intelligently, and, more than that, without making mistakes
	and without embarrassment, and, in addition to all this,
	with confidence?—Surely.—Well then, if you are on horseback
	and have ridden out upon the plain against a man who
	is on foot, are you in anxiety, assuming that you are in
	practice and the other is not?—Yes, that is all very well,
	but Caesar has authority to put me to death.—Then tell
	the truth, wretch, and do not brag, nor claim to be a philosopher,
	nor fail to recognize your masters; but as long as
	you let them have this hold on you through your body,
	follow everyone that is stronger than you are. But Socrates
	used to practise speaking to some purpose—Socrates, who
	discoursed as he did to the Tyrants,[c dimgray][sup]49[/sup][/c] to his judges, and in
	the prison. Diogenes had practised speaking—Diogenes,
	who talked to Alexander as he did, to Philip, to the pirates,
	to the man who had bought him … \[Leave such matters\]
	to those who are seriously interested in them, to the brave;
	but do you walk away to your own concerns and never

	[b][c dimgray]14. To Naso[/c][/b]
	Once when a certain Roman citizen[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c] accompanied by
	his son had come in and was listening to one of his readings,
	Epictetus said: This is the style of my teaching, and
	then lapsed into silence. But when the other requested to
	know what came next, he replied: Instruction in the technique
	of any art is boring to the layman who has had no
	experience in it. Now the products of the arts show immediately
	their use towards the purpose for which they are
	made, and most of them possess also a certain attractiveness
	and charm. For example, to stand by and watch the
	process by which a shoemaker learns his trade is, indeed,
	not pleasant, yet the shoe is useful and not an unpleasant
	thing to look at either. And the process of education in the
	case of a carpenter is especially tiresome to the layman who
	happens to be watching, but the work which the carpenter
	does shows the use of his art. You will find the same much
	more true in the case of music; for if you are standing by
	when someone is taking a lesson, the process of instruction
	will strike you as the most unpleasant of all, yet the results
	of music are sweet and pleasing to the ear of the layman.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So also in our own case, we picture the work of the
	philosopher to be something like this: He should bring his
	own will into harmony with what happens, so that neither
	anything that happens happens against our will, nor anything
	that fails to happen fails to happen when we wish it
	to happen. The result of this for those who have so ordered
	the work of philosophy is that in desire they are not disappointed,
	[m1]\ [/m]

	A Julius Naso, the son of a man of letters, is mentioned not infrequently in the correspondence of the younger Pliny. See

	and in aversion they do not fall into what they
	would avoid; that each person passes his life to himself,
	free from pain, fear, and perturbation, at the same time
	maintaining with his associates both the natural and the acquired
	relationships, those namely of son, father, brother,
	citizen, wife, neighbour, fellow-traveller, ruler, and subject.

	Something like this is our picture of the work of the
	philosopher. The next thing after this is that we seek the
	means of achieving it. We see, then, that the carpenter
	becomes a carpenter by first learning something, the
	helmsman becomes a helmsman by first learning something.
	May it not be, then, that in our case also it is not
	sufficient to wish to become noble and good, but that we
	are under the necessity of learning something first? We
	seek, then, what this is. Now the philosophers say that the
	first thing we must learn is this: That there is a God, and
	that He provides for the universe, and that it is impossible
	for a man to conceal from Him, not merely his actions, but
	even his purposes and his thoughts. Next we must learn
	what the gods are like; for whatever their character is discovered
	to be, the man who is going to please and obey
	them must endeavour as best he can to resemble them. If
	the deity is faithful, he also must be faithful; if free, he also
	must be free; if beneficent, he also must be beneficent; if
	high-minded, he also must be high-minded, and so forth;
	therefore, in everything he says and does, he must act as
	an imitator of God.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Where, then, ought I to start?—If you enter upon this
	task, I will say that in the first place you ought to understand
	the meaning of terms.—So you imply that I do not
	now understand the meaning of terms?—You do not.—

	How comes it, then, that I use them?—Why, you use them
	as the illiterate use written speech, as the cattle use external
	impressions; for use is one thing, and understanding
	another. But if you think you understand terms, propose
	any term you please, and let us put ourselves to the test, to
	see whether we understand it.—But it is unpleasant to
	be subjected to an examination when one is already somewhat
	advanced in years, and, if it so chance, has served his
	three campaigns.[c dimgray][sup]52[/sup][/c]—I realize that myself. For now you
	have come to me like a man who stood in need of nothing.
	But what could anyone even imagine you to be in need of?
	You are rich, you have children, possibly also a wife, and
	many slaves; Caesar knows you, you have many friends in
	Rome, you perform the duties incumbent upon you, and
	when a man has done you either good or harm you know
	how to pay him back in kind. What do you still lack? If,
	therefore, I show you that what you lack are things most
	necessary and important for happiness, and that hitherto
	you have devoted your attention to everything but what
	was appropriate for you to do, and if I add the colophon,[c dimgray][sup]53[/sup][/c]

	citizen of the same state, both the large state[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c] and the
	small; and then, though in the act of murder, and while
	engaged in the destruction of a human being that has done
	no wrong, you say that you “must abide by your decisions!”
	But if the idea ever entered your head to kill [c dimgray]me,[/c] would
	you have to abide by your decisions?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Well, it was hard work to persuade that man; but there
	are some men of to-day whom it is impossible to move. So
	that I feel that I now know what I formerly did not understand—the meaning of the proverb, “A fool you can neither
	persuade nor break.”[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c] God forbid that I should ever
	have for a friend a wise fool![c dimgray][sup]57[/sup][/c] There is nothing harder to
	handle. “I have decided,” he says! Why yes, and so have
	madmen; but the more firm their decision is about what is
	false, the more hellebore[c dimgray][sup]58[/sup][/c] they need. Will you not act like
	a sick man, and summon a physician? “I am sick, sir; help
	me. Consider what I ought to do; it is my part to obey you.”
	So also in the present instance. “I know not what I ought to
	be doing, but I have come to find out.” Thus one should
	speak. No, but this is what one hears, “Talk to me about
	anything else, but on this point I have made my decision.”
	“Anything else” indeed! Why, what is more important or
	more to your advantage than to be convinced that it is not
	sufficient for a man merely to have reached decisions, and
	to refuse to change? These are the sinews of madness, not
	health. “If you force me to this, I would gladly die.” What
	for, man? What has happened? “I have decided”! It was

	answer sophisms? Why, then, are you surprised to find that
	in the fields in which you have practised you surpass yourself,
	but in that in which you have not practised you remain
	the same? For why is it that the orator, although he knows
	that he has composed a good speech, has memorized what
	he has written and is bringing a pleasing voice to his task,
	is still anxious despite all that? Because he is not satisfied
	with the mere practise of oratory. What, then, does he
	want? He wants to be praised by his audience. Now he has
	trained himself with a view to being able to practise oratory,
	but he has not trained himself with reference to praise
	and blame. For when did he ever hear any one say what
	praise is, what blame is, and what is the nature of each?
	What kinds of praise are to be sought, and what kinds of
	blame are to be avoided? And when did he ever go through
	this course of training in accordance with these principles?
	Why, then, are you any longer surprised because he surpasses
	all others in the field in which he has studied, but
	in that in which he has not practised he is no better than
	the multitude? He is like a citharoede who knows how to
	play to the harp, sings well, has a beautiful flowing gown,
	and still trembles when he comes upon the stage; for all
	that has gone before he knows, but what a crowd is he does
	not know, nor what the shouting and the scornful laughter
	of a crowd are. Nay, he does not even know what this
	anxiety itself is, whether it is something that we can control,
	or beyond our powers, whether he can stop it or not.
	That is why, if he is praised, he goes off the stage all puffed
	up; but if he is laughed to scorn, that poor windbag of his
	conceit is pricked and flattens out.

	We too experience something of the same kind. What
	do we admire? Externals. What are we in earnest about?

	About externals. Are we, then, at a loss to know how it comes
	about that we are subject to fear and anxiety? Why,
	what else can possibly happen, when we regard impending
	events as things evil? We cannot help but be in fear,
	we cannot help but be in anxiety. And then we say, “O
	Lord God, how may I escape anxiety?” Fool, have you not
	hands? Did not God make them for you? Sit down now and
	pray forsooth that the mucus in your nose may not run!
	Nay, rather wipe your nose and do not blame God! What
	then? Has he given you nothing that helps in the present
	case? Has he not given you endurance, has he not given
	you magnanimity, has he not given you courage? When you
	have such serviceable hands as these do you still look for
	someone to wipe your nose? But these virtues we neither
	practise nor concern ourselves withal. Why, show me one
	single man who cares [c dimgray]how[/c] he does something, who is concerned,
	not with getting something, but with his own action.
	Who is there that is concerned with his own action
	while he is walking around? Who, when he is planning, is
	concerned with the plan itself, and not with getting what
	he is planning about? And then if he gets it, he is all set up
	and says, “Yes, indeed, what a fine plan we made! Did I
	not tell you, brother, that, if there was anything at all in
	my views, it was impossible for the plan to fall out otherwise?”
	But if the plan goes the other way, he is humble and
	wretched, and cannot even find any explanation at what has
	happened. Who of us ever called in a seer for a case of this
	kind? Who of us ever slept in a temple[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c] for enlightenment

	Why, then, do we wonder any longer that, although in
	material things we are thoroughly experienced, nevertheless
	in our actions we are dejected, unseemly, worthless,
	cowardly, unwilling to stand the strain, utter failures one
	and all? For we have not troubled ourselves about these
	matters in time past, nor do we even now practise them.
	Yet if we were afraid, not of death or exile, but of fear itself,
	then we should practise how not to encounter those things
	that appear evil to us. But as it is, we are fiery and fluent in

	to sea, on gazing down into the deep or looking around

	myself, fancying that if I am wrecked I shall have to swallow
	this whole expanse of waters; but it does not occur to
	me that three pints are enough. What is it, then, that disturbs
	me? The expanse of sea? No, but my judgement.
	Again, when there is an earthquake, I fancy that the whole
	city is going to fall upon me; what, is not a little stone
	enough to knock my brains out?

	what else is the burden that is weighing him down but a
	judgement? Children, indeed, when they cry a little because
	their nurse has left, forget their troubles as soon as
	they get a cookie. Would you, therefore, have [c dimgray]us[/c] resemble
	children? No, by Zeus! For I claim that we should be
	influenced in this way, not by a cookie, but by true judgements.
	And what are these? The things which a man ought
	to practise all day long, without being devoted to what is
	not his own, either comrade, or place, or gymnasia, nay, not
	even to his own body; but he should remember the law and
	keep that before his eyes. And what is the law of God? To
	guard what is his own, not to lay claim to what is not his
	own, but to make use of what is given him, and not to yearn
	for what has not been given; when something is taken
	away, to give it up readily and without delay, being grateful
	for the time in which he had the use of it—all this if you do
	not wish to be crying for your nurse and your mammy! For
	what difference does it make what object a man has a
	weakness for and depends upon? In what respect are you
	superior to the man who weeps for a maid, if you grieve
	for a trivial gymnasium, a paltry colonnade, a group of
	youngsters, and that way of spending your time? Someone
	else comes and grieves because he is no longer going to
	drink the water of Dirce.[c dimgray][sup]63[/sup][/c] What, is the water of the Marcian
	aqueduct inferior to that of Dirce? “Nay, but I was
	accustomed to that water.” And you will get accustomed to
	this in turn. And then, if you become addicted to something
	of this kind, weep for this too in turn, and try to write

	and friends did he have with him as he went

	a son of God, and was. It was therefore in obedience to His

	But you are no Heracles, you say, and you cannot
	clear away the wickedness of other men, nay, nor are you
	even a Theseus, to clear away the ills of Attica merely. Very
	well, clear away your own then. From just here, from out

	fear, desire, envy, joy at others’ ills; cast out greed, effeminacy,

	devoted to Him only, and consecrated to His commands.
	But if you wish anything else, with lamentation and groaning

	To get rid of thinking that one knows;[c dimgray][sup]71[/sup][/c] for it is impossible
	to get a man to begin to learn that which he thinks
	he knows. However, as we go to the philosophers we all
	babble hurly-burly about what ought to be done and what
	ought not, good and evil, fair and foul, and on these
	grounds assign praise and blame, censure and reprehension,
	passing judgement on fair and foul practices, and
	discriminating between them. But what do we go to the
	philosophers for? To learn what we do [c dimgray]not[/c] think we know.
	And what is that? General principles. For some of us want
	to learn what the philosophers are saying, thinking it will
	be witty and shrewd, others, because they wish to profit
	thereby. But it is absurd to think that when a man wishes
	to learn one thing he will actually learn something else, or,
	in short, that a man will make progress in anything without
	learning it. But the multitude are under the same misapprehension
	as was Theopompus, the orator,[c dimgray][sup]72[/sup][/c] who actually
	censures Plato for wishing to define every term. Well, what
	does he say? “Did none of us before your time ever use the
	words ‘good’ or ‘just’? Or, without understanding what
	each of these terms severally mean, did we merely utter
	them as vague and empty sounds?” Why, who tells you,
	Theopompus, that we did not have a natural conception of
	each term, that is, a preconceived idea of it? But it is impossible
	to adjust our preconceived ideas to the appropriate

	καὶ αὐτὸ τοῦτο σκεψάμενον, ποίαν τινὰ ἑκάστῃ αὐτῶν
	[c dimgray]8[/c]οὐσίαν ὑποτακτέον. ἐπεὶ τοιαῦτα λέγε καὶ πρὸς τοὺς
	ἰατρούς· “τίς γὰρ ἡμῶν οὐκ ἔλεγεν ὑγιεινόν τι καὶ
	νοσερόν, πρὶν Ἱπποκράτη γενέσθαι; ἢ κενῶς τὰς φωνὰς
	[c dimgray]9[/c]ταύτας ἀπηχοῦμεν;” ἔχομεν γάρ τινα καὶ ὑγιεινοῦ

	μὲν λέγει “ἀνάτεινον,” ὁ δὲ λέγει “δὸς τροφήν·” καὶ ὁ
	μὲν λέγει “φλεβοτόμησον,” ὁ δὲ λέγει “σικύασον.” τί
	τὸ αἴτιον; ἄλλο γε ἢ ὅτι τὴν τοῦ ὑγιεινοῦ πρόληψιν

	[c dimgray]10[/c]Οὕτως ἔχει καὶ ἐνθάδ᾿ ἐπὶ τῶν κατὰ τὸν βίον.
	ἀγαθὸν καὶ κακὸν καὶ συμφέρον καὶ ἀσύμφορον τίς
	ἡμῶν οὐ λαλεῖ; τίς γὰρ ἡμῶν οὐκ ἔχει τούτων ἑκάστου
	πρόληψιν; ἆρ᾿ οὖν διηρθρωμένην καὶ τελείαν; τοῦτο
	[c dimgray]11[/c]δεῖξον. “πῶς δείξω;” ἐφάρμοσον αὐτὴν καλῶς ταῖς ἐπὶ

	ὁ μέν τις ἐφαρμόζει τὴν τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ πρόληψιν, ὁ δ᾿
	[c dimgray]13[/c]οὔ; τῇ δὲ τῆς ἡδονῆς, τῇ δὲ τῆς ὑγείας; καθόλου γὰρ
	εἰ πάντες οἱ τὰ ὀνόματα λαλοῦντες μὴ κενῶς ἴσμεν

	ate facts without having first systematized them and having
	raised precisely this question—what particular fact is to be
	classified under each preconception. Suppose, for example,
	that you make the same sort of remark to the physicians:
	“Why, who among us did not use terms ‘healthy’
	and ‘diseased’ before Hippocrates was born? Or were we
	merely making an empty noise with these sounds?” For,
	of course, we have a certain preconception of the idea
	“healthy.” But we are unable to apply it. That is why one
	person says, “Keep abstaining from food,” and another,
	“Give nourishment”; again, one says, “Cut a vein,” and
	another says, “Use the cupping-glass.” What is the reason?
	Is it really anything but the fact that a person is unable
	properly to apply the preconceived idea of “healthy” to the
	specific instances?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So it stands here also, in the affairs of life. Who among
	us has not upon his lips the words “good” and “evil,” “advantageous”
	and “disadvantageous”? For who among us
	does not have a preconceived idea of each of these terms?
	Very well, is it fitted into a system and complete? Prove
	that it is. “How shall I prove it?” Apply it properly to specific
	facts. To start with, Plato classifies definitions under
	the preconception “the useful,” but you classify them under
	that of “the useless.” Is it, then, possible for both of you
	to be right? How can that be? Does not one man apply his
	preconceived idea of “the good” to the fact of wealth, while
	another does not? And another to that of pleasure, and yet
	another to that of health? Indeed, to sum up the whole
	matter, if all of us who have these terms upon our lips
	possess no mere empty knowledge of each one severally,
	and do not need to devote any pains to the systematic
	arrangement of our preconceived ideas, why do we disagree,

	why fight, why blame one another?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And yet what need is there for me to bring forward now
	our strife with one another and make mention of that? Take
	you own case; if you apply properly your preconceived
	ideas, why are you troubled,[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c] why are you hampered? Let
	us pass by for the moment the second field of study[c dimgray][sup]74[/sup][/c]—that
	which has to do with out choices and the discussion of what
	is our duty in regard to them. Let us pass by also the
	third—that which has to do with our assents. I make you a
	present of all this. Let us confine our attention to the first
	field, one which allows an almost palpable proof that you
	do not properly apply your preconceived ideas. Do you at
	this moment desire what is possible in general and what is
	possible for you in particular? If so, why are you hampered?
	Why are you troubled? Are you not at this moment
	trying to escape what is inevitable? If so, why do you fall
	into any trouble, why are you unfortunate? Why is it that
	when you want something it does not happen, and when
	you do not want it, it does happen? For this is the strongest
	proof of trouble and misfortune. I want something, and it
	does not happen; and what creature is more wretched than
	I? I do not want something, and it does happen; and what
	creature is more wretched than I?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Medea, for example, because she could not endure this,
	came to the point of killing her children. In this respect at
	least hers was the act of a great spirit. For she had the
	proper conception of what it means for anyone’s wishes not
	to come true. “Very well, then,” says she,[c dimgray][sup]75[/sup][/c] “in these circumstances
	I shall take vengeance upon the man who has

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c]The word, δυσροεῖν, is the opposite of the technical term
	εὐροεῖν (τὸ εὐροῦν, εὐροία), which is a metaphor derived from
	the even flow of quiet waters.
	[c dimgray][sup]74[/sup][/c]The three fields, according to Epictetus, are, 1. ὄρεξις, desire;
	2. ὁρμή, choice; 3. συγκατάθεσις, assent. Compare III.2.

	his being in such an evil plight? How can that be accomplished?
	I kill my children. But I shall be punishing myself
	also. Yet what do I care?” This is the outbursting of a soul
	of great force. For she did not know where the power lies
	to do what we wish—that we cannot get this from outside
	ourselves, nor by disturbing and deranging things. Give up
	wanting to keep your husband, and nothing of what you
	want fails to happen. Give up wanting him to live with you
	at any cost. Give up wanting to remain in Corinth, and, in
	a word, give up wanting anything but what God wants. And
	who will prevent you, who will compel you? No one, any
	more than anyone prevents or compels Zeus.

	When you have such a leader as Zeus and identify your

	that you will fail? Give to poverty and to wealth your aversion
	and your desire: you will fail to get what you wish, and
	you will fall into what you would avoid. Give them to
	health; you will come to grief; so also if you give them to
	offices, honours, country, friends, children, in short to anything
	that lies outside the domain of moral purpose. But
	give them to Zeus and the other gods; entrust them to their
	keeping, let them exercise the control; let your desire and
	your aversion be ranged on their side—and how can you
	be troubled any longer? But if you show envy, wretched
	man, and pity, and jealousy, and timidity, and never let a
	day pass without bewailing yourself and the gods, how can
	you continue to say that you have been educated? What
	kind of education, man, do you mean? Because you have
	worked on syllogisms, and arguments with equivocal premisses?

	towards my country, towards strangers.” Advance now
	to the second field of study; this also is yours. “Yes, but I

	Every habit and faculty is confirmed and strengthened

	that of running by running. If you wish to be a good reader,
	read; if you wish to be a good writer, write. If you should
	give up reading for thirty days one after the other, and be
	engaged in something else, you will know what happens.
	So also if you lie in bed for ten days, get up and try to take
	a rather long walk, and you will see how wobbly your legs
	are. In general, therefore, if you want to do something,
	make a habit of it; if you want not to do something, refrain
	from doing it, and accustom yourself to something else
	instead. The same principle holds true in the affairs of
	the mind also; when you are angry, you may be sure, not
	merely that this evil has befallen you, but also that you have
	strengthened the habit, and have, as it were, added fuel to
	the flame. When you have yielded to someone in carnal
	intercourse, do not count merely this one defeat, but count
	also the fact that you have fed your incontinence, you have
	given it additional strength. For it is inevitable that some

	habits and faculties should, in consequence of the corresponding
	actions, spring up, though they did not exist before,
	and that others which were already there should be
	intensified and made strong.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In this way, without doubt, the infirmities of our mind
	and character spring up, as the philosophers say. For when
	once you conceive a desire for money, if reason be applied
	to bring you to a realization of the evil, both the passion is
	stilled and our governing principle is restored to its original
	authority; but if you do not apply a remedy, your governing
	principle does not revert to its previous condition,
	but, on being aroused again by the corresponding external
	impressions, it bursts into the flame of desire more quickly
	than it did before. And if this happens over and over again,
	the next stage is that a callousness results and the infirmity
	strengthens the avarice. For the man who has had a fever,
	and then recovered, is not the same as he was before the
	fever, unless he has experienced a complete cure. Something
	like this happens also with the affections of the mind.
	Certain imprints and weals are left behind on the mind,
	and unless a man erases them perfectly, the next time he
	is scourged upon the old scars, he has weals no longer but
	wounds. If, therefore, you wish not to be hot-tempered, do
	not feed your habit, set before it nothing on which it can
	grow. As the first step, keep quiet and count the days on
	which you have not been angry. “I used to be angry every
	day, after that every other day, then every third, and then
	every fourth day.” If you go as much as thirty days without a
	fit of anger, sacrifice to God. For the habit is first weakened
	and then utterly destroyed. “To-day I was not grieved” (and

	To-day when I saw a handsome lad or a handsome
	woman I did not say to myself, “Would that a man might
	sleep with her,” and “Her husband is a happy man,” for the
	man who uses the expression “happy” of the husband
	means “Happy is the adulterer” also; I do not even picture
	to myself the next scene—the woman herself in my presence,
	disrobing and lying down by my side. I pat myself on
	the head and say, Well done, Epictetus, you have solved a
	clever problem, one much more clever than the so-called
	“Master”:[c dimgray][sup]80[/sup][/c] But when the wench is not only willing, but
	nods to me and sends for me, yes, and when she even lays
	hold upon me and snuggles up to me, if I still hold aloof
	and conquer, this has become a solved problem greater
	than [c dimgray]The Liar[/c], and [c dimgray]The Quiescent.[/c][c dimgray][sup]81[/sup][/c] On this score a man

	How, then, may this be done? Make it your wish finally
	to satisfy your own self, make it your wish to appear beautiful
	in the sight of God. Set your desire upon becoming
	pure in the presence of your pure self and of God. “Then
	when an external impression of that sort comes suddenly
	upon you,” says Plato,[c dimgray][sup]82[/sup][/c] “go and offer an expiatory sacrifice,

	who you are, and what you are an impression of; allow me

	Everything true as an event in the past is necessary, and
	(2) An impossible does not follow a possible, and (3) What
	is not true now and never will be, is nevertheless possible,
	Diodorus, realizing this contradiction, used the plausibility
	of the first two propositions to establish the principle,
	Nothing is possible which is neither true now nor ever will
	be. But one man will maintain, among the possible combinations
	of two at a time, the following, namely, (3) Something
	is possible, which is not true now and never will be,
	and (2) An impossible does not follow a possible; yet he
	will not grant the third proposition (1), Everything true
	as an event in the past is necessary, which is what Cleanthes
	and his group, whom Antipater has stoutly supported,
	seem to think. But others will maintain the other two
	propositions, (3) A thing is possible which is not true now
	and never will be, and (1) Everything true as an event in
	the past is necessary, and then will assert that, An impossible
	[c dimgray]does[/c] follow a possible.[c dimgray][sup]89[/sup][/c] But there is no way by which
	one can maintain all three of these propositions, because
	of their mutual contradiction.[c dimgray][sup]90[/sup][/c]

	If, then, someone asks me, “But which pair of these do
	you yourself maintain?” I shall answer him that I do not
	know; but I have received the following account: Diodorus
	used to maintain one pair, Panthoides and his group, I
	believe, and Cleanthes another, and Chrysippus and his
	group the third. “What, then, is [c dimgray]your[/c] opinion?” I do not

	[c dimgray][sup]89[/sup][/c]That is, deny (2) that “An impossible does [c dimgray]not[/c] follow a possible.”
	[c dimgray][sup]90[/sup][/c] That is, each pair is in conflict with the third.

	When asked, “Who was the father of Hector?” he replied,
	“Priam.” “Who were his brothers?” “Alexander and

	is the account that I have received.” “From whom?” “From

	about these same matters, and possibly others like him.”

	further have I to say about it? But if I am a vain person, I
	can astonish the company, especially at a banquet, by enumerating
	those who have written on the subject. “Chrysippus
	also has written admirably on this topic in the first book
	of his treatise [c dimgray]On Things Possible[/c]. And Cleanthes has written
	a special work on the subject, and Archedemus. Antipater
	also has written, not only in his book [c dimgray]On Things
	Possible[/c], but also a separate monograph in his discussion
	of [c dimgray]The Master Argument[/c]. Have you not read the treatise?”
	“I have not read it.” “Then read it.” And what good will it
	do him? He will be more trifling and tiresome than he is
	already. You, for example, what have you gained by the
	reading of it? What judgement have you formed on the

	island of Calypso[c dimgray][sup]91[/sup][/c] which never was and never will be!

	do me this favour; do not begrudge an old man the sight
	of that spectacle which to this very day I have never seen.
	Do you fancy that you are going to show me the Zeus or
	the Athena of Pheidias, a creation of ivory and gold? Let
	one of you show me the soul of a man who wishes to be of
	one mind with God, and never again to blame either God
	or man, to fail in nothing that he would achieve, to fall into
	nothing that he would avoid, to be free from anger, envy
	and jealousy—but why use circumlocutions?—a man who
	has set his heart upon changing from a man into a god, and
	although he is still in this paltry body of death, does none
	the less have his purpose set upon fellowship with Zeus.
	Show him to me! But you cannot. Why, then, do you mock
	your own selves and cheat everybody else? And why do you
	put on a guise that is not your own and walk about as
	veritable thieves and robbers who have stolen these designations
	and properties that in no sense belong to you?

	And so now I am your teacher, and you are being taught
	in my school. And my purpose is this—to make of you
	a perfect work, secure against restraint, compulsion, and
	hindrance, free, prosperous, happy, looking to God in
	everything both small and great; and you are here with the
	purpose of learning and practising all this. Why, then, do

	contradicts it finds himself obliged at the same time to
	employ it. For example, if a man should contradict the
	proposition that there is a universal statement which is
	true, it is clear that he must assert the contrary, and say:
	No universal statement is true. Slave, this is not true,
	either. For what else does this assertion amount to than: If
	a statement is universal, it is false? Again, if a man comes
	forward and says, “I would have you know that nothing is
	knowable, but that everything is uncertain;” or if someone
	else says, “Believe me, and it will be to your advantage,
	when I say: One ought not to believe a man at all;” or again,
	someone else, “Learn from me, man, that it is impossible
	to learn anything; it is I who tell you this and I will prove
	it to you, if you wish,” what difference is there between
	these persons and—whom shall I say?—those who call
	themselves Academics? “O men,” say the Academics, “give
	your assent to the statement that no man assents to any
	statement; believe [c dimgray]us[/c] when we say that no man can believe
	anybody.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So also Epicurus, when he wishes to do away with the
	natural fellowship of men with one another, at the same
	time makes use of the very principle that he is doing away
	with. For what does he say? “Be not deceived, men, nor
	led astray, nor mistaken; there is no natural fellowship with
	one another among rational beings; believe me. Those who
	say the contrary are deceiving you and leading you astray
	with false reasons.” Why do [c dimgray]you[/c] care, then? Allow us to be
	deceived. Will you fare any the worse, if all the rest of us
	are persuaded that we do have a natural fellowship with
	one another, and that we ought by all means to guard it?
	Nay, your position will be much better and safer. Man, why

	opinions, write them down and bequeathe them to others
	and give up your sleep because of them and become in fact

	Shall we speak of Orestes as being pursued by the Furies

	inconceivable. Neither, then, is it possible for a man
	absolutely to lose the affections of a man, and those who
	cut off their bodily organs are unable to cut off the really
	important thing—their sexual desires. So with Epicurus:
	he cut off everything that characterizes a man, the head of

	in cutting off the desires of human beings; for that he could

	but does exactly the opposite, endeavouring to take away
	and destroy whatever faculty he does possess for discovering
	the truth. What do you say, philosopher? What is your
	opinion of piety and sanctity? “If you wish, I shall prove
	that it is good.” By all means, prove it, that our citizens may
	be converted and may honour the Divine and at last cease
	to be indifferent about the things that are of supreme importance.
	“Do you, then, possess the proofs?” I do, thank
	heaven. “Since, then, you are quite satisfied with all this,
	hear the contrary: The gods do not exist, and even if they
	do, they pay no attention to men, nor have we any fellowship
	with them, and hence this piety and sanctity which the
	multitude talk about is a lie told by impostors and sophists,
	or, I swear, by legislators to frighten and restrain evildoers.”
	Well done, philosopher! You have conferred a service
	upon our citizens, you have recovered our young men who
	were already inclining to despise things divine. “What
	then? Does not all this satisfy you? Learn now how righteousness
	is nothing, how reverence is folly, how a father is
	nothing, how a son is nothing.” Well done, philosopher!
	Keep at it; persuade the young men, that we may have
	more who feel and speak as you do. It is from principles
	like these that our well-governed states have grown great!
	Principles like these have made Sparta what it was! These
	are the convictions which Lycurgus wrought into the Spartans
	by his laws and his system of education, namely that
	neither is slavery base rather than noble, nor freedom noble
	rather than base! Those who died at Thermopylae died

	Grateful men indeed and reverential: Why, if nothing

	enjoy night and day, the changes of the year and the stars
	and the sea and the earth and the co-operation of men,
	they are not moved in the least by any one of these things,
	but look merely for a chance to belch out their trivial
	“problem,” and after thus exercising their stomach to go
	off to the bath. But what they are going to say, or what they
	are going to talk about, or to whom, and what their hearers
	are going to get out of these things that they are saying, all

	and be influenced by them, or, having been influenced
	already, may lose all the germs of the nobility which
	he possessed; that we may be giving an adulterer grounds

	What, then, in your opinion is good or bad, base or

	Some of their faults men readily admit, but others not
	so readily. Now no one will admit that he is foolish or
	unintelligent, but, quite the contrary, you hear everyone
	say, “I wish I had as much luck as I have sense.” But they
	readily admit that they are timid, and say, “I am a bit timid,
	I admit; but in general you will not find me to be a fool.”
	A man will not readily admit that he is incontinent, not at
	all that he is unjust, and will never admit that he is envious
	or meddlesome; but most men will admit that they are
	moved by pity. What is the reason for this? The principal
	reason is confusion of thought and an unwillingness to
	admit a fault in matters which involve good and evil; but,
	apart from that, different people are affected by different
	motives, and, as a rule, they will never admit anything that
	they conceive to be disgraceful; timidity, for example, they
	conceive to be an indication of a prudent disposition, and
	the same is true of pity, but stupidity they conceive to be
	a slave’s quality altogether; also they will never plead guilty
	to offences against society. Now in the case of most errors,

	the principal reason why men are inclined to admit them
	is because they conceive that there is an involuntary element
	in them, as, for instance, in timidity and pity. And if
	a man ever does, grudgingly, admit that he is incontinent,
	he adds that he is in love, expecting to be excused as for an
	involuntary act. But injustice they do not at all conceive of
	as involuntary. In jealousy there is also, as they fancy, an
	element of the involuntary, and therefore this too is a fault
	which men grudgingly admit.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When such are the men we live among—so confused,
	so ignorant both of what they mean by “evil” and what evil
	quality they have, or whether they have one, or, if so, how
	they come to have it, or how they will get rid of it—among
	such men I wonder whether it is not worth while for us also
	to watch ourselves, each one asking himself the questions:
	“Is it possible that I too am one of these people? What
	conceit am I cherishing regarding myself? How do I conduct
	myself? Do I for my part act like a wise man? Do I
	for my part act like a man of self-control? Do I for my part
	ever say that I have been educated to meet whatever
	comes? Have I the consciousness, proper to a man who
	knows nothing, that I do know nothing? Do I go to my

	to obey? Or do I, too, like a sniffling child, go to school to
	learn only the history of philosophy and to understand the
	books which I did not understand before, and, if chance
	offers, to explain them to others?” Man, at home you have
	fought a regular prize-fight with your slave, you have
	driven your household into the street, you have disturbed
	your neighbours’ peace; and now do you come to me with
	a solemn air, like a philosopher, and sitting down pass

	because nothing is being sent you from home,[c dimgray][sup]101[/sup][/c] and you
	sit there while the lecture is going on, thinking, on your
	part, of nothing in the world but how you stand with your
	father or your brother! You reflect: “What are my people
	at home saying about me? At this moment they are thinking
	that I am making progress in my studies, and they are
	saying ‘He will know everything when he comes back
	home!’ I did want, at one time, I suppose, to learn everything
	before going back home, but that requires a great
	deal of hard work, and nobody sends me anything, and at
	Nicopolis they have rotten accommodations at the baths,
	and my lodgings are bad, and the school here is bad.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And then people say: “Nobody gets any good from going
	to school.” Well, who goes to school—who, I repeat—with the expectation of being cured? Who with the
	expectation of submitting his own judgements for purification?
	Who with the expectation of coming to a realization
	of what judgements he needs? Why, then, are you
	surprised, if you carry back home from your school precisely
	the judgements you bring to it? For you do not come
	with the expectation of laying them aside, or of correcting
	them, or of getting others in exchange for them. Not at all,
	nor anything like it. Look rather to this at least—whether
	you are getting what you came for. You want to be able to
	speak fluently about philosophic principles. Well, are you
	not becoming more of an idle babbler? Do not these petty
	philosophic principles supply you with material for making
	exhibitions? Do you not resolve syllogisms, and arguments

	eye-salves are not useless to those who rub them
	on when and as they ought, and poultices are not useless,
	jumping-weights are not useless; but they are useless to
	some people, and, on the other hand, useful to others. If

	I will tell him that it is useful. “Is it useful, then, to me?” I

	[b][c dimgray]22. Of friendship[/c][/b]
	Whatever a man is interested in he naturally loves. Now
	do men take an interest in things evil? Not at all. Well, and
	do they take an interest in things which in no respect concern
	them? No, not in these, either. It remains, therefore,
	that men take an interest in good things only; and if they
	take an interest in them, they love them. Whoever, then,
	has knowledge of good things, would know how to love
	them too; but when a man is unable to distinguish things
	good from things evil, and what is neither good nor evil
	from both the others, how could he take the next step and
	have the power to love? Accordingly, the power to love
	belongs to the wise man and to him alone.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	How so? says someone; for I am foolish myself, but yet
	I love my child.—By the gods, I am surprised at you; at the
	very outset you have admitted that you are foolish. For
	something is lacking in you; what is it? Do you not use
	sense perception, do you not distinguish between external
	impressions, do you not supply the nourishment for your
	body that is suitable to it, and shelter, and a dwelling? How
	comes it, then, that you admit you are foolish? Because, by
	Zeus, you are frequently bewildered and disturbed by your
	external impressions, and overcome by their persuasive
	character; and at one moment you consider these things
	good, and then again you consider them, though the very
	same, evil, and later on as neither good nor evil; and, in a
	word, you are subject to pain, fear, envy, turmoil, and
	change; that is why you are foolish, as you admit you are.
	And in loving are you not changeable? But as for wealth,
	and pleasure, and, in a word, material things, do you not
	consider them at one moment good, at another bad? And

	subject to change show good will to that friend?—No, neither

	to, throw a piece of meat between them and you will find

	wants to bury you, the sooner the better, and how earnestly

	attainment of this, we revile even them, cast their statues
	to the ground, and burn their temples, as Alexander ordered
	the temples of Asclepius to be burned when his
	loved one died.[c dimgray][sup]106[/sup][/c] For this reason, if a man puts together
	in one scale his interest and righteousness and what is
	honourable and country and parents and friends, they are
	all safe; but if he puts his interest in one scale, and in the
	other friends and country and kinsmen and justice itself,
	all these latter are lost because they are outweighed by his
	interest. For where one can say “I” and “mine,” to that side
	must the creature perforce incline; if they[c dimgray][sup]107[/sup][/c] are in the
	flesh, there must the ruling power be; if they are in the
	moral purpose, there must it be; if they are in externals,
	there must it be. If, therefore, I am where my moral purpose
	is, then, and then only, will I be the friend and son
	and the father that I should be. For then this will be my
	interest—to keep my good faith, my self-respect, my forbearance,
	my abstinence, and my co-operation, and to
	maintain my relations with other men. But if I put what is
	mine in one scale, and what is honourable in the other, then
	the statement of Epicurus assumes strength, in which he
	declares that “the honourable is either nothing at all, or at
	best only what people hold in esteem.”

	It was through ignorance of this that the Athenians and
	Lacedaemonians quarrelled, and the Thebans with both of
	them, and the Great King with Greece, and the Macedonians

	with both of them, and in our days the Romans with
	the Getae, and yet earlier than any of these, what happened
	at Ilium was due to this. Alexander was a guest of
	Menelaus, and if anyone had seen their friendly treatment
	of one another, he would have disbelieved any man who
	said they were not friends. But there was thrown in between
	them a morsel, a pretty woman, and to win her war
	arose. So now, when you see friends, or brothers, who seem
	to be of one mind, do not instantly make pronouncement
	about their friendship, not even if they swear to it, nor even
	if they say that they cannot be separated from one another.
	The ruling principle of the bad man is not to be trusted; it
	is insecure, incapable of judgement, a prey now to one external
	impression and now to another. Nay, do not make
	the same enquiry that most men do, asking whether two
	men are of the same parents, or were brought up together,
	or had the same school attendant, but this, and this only:
	Where do they put their interest—outside themselves, or
	in their moral purpose? If outside, call them not friends,
	any more than you would call them faithful, steadfast, courageous,
	or free; nay, call them not even human beings, if
	you are wise. For it is no judgement of human sort which
	makes them bite (that is revile) one another, and take to
	the desert (that is, to the market-place) as wild beasts take
	to the mountains, and in courts of law act the part of brigands;
	nor is it a judgement of human sort which makes
	them profligates and adulterers and corrupters; nor is it
	any such thing which makes men guilty of any of the many

	thereby disparaging the gifts received from God, as though
	one were denying the usefulness of the faculty of vision, or
	that of hearing, or that of speech itself. Did God give you
	eyes to no purpose, did He to no purpose put in them a
	spirit[c dimgray][sup]110[/sup][/c] so strong and so cunningly devised that it reaches
	out to a great distance and fashions the forms of whatever
	is seen? And what messenger is so swift and so attentive as
	the eye? And did He to no purpose make also the intervening
	air so active and so intent[c dimgray][sup]111[/sup][/c] that the vision passes
	through it as through some tense medium? And did He to
	no purpose create light, without the presence of which all
	else were useless?

	Man, be neither ungrateful for these gifts, nor yet forgetful
	of the better things, but for sight and hearing, yes
	and, by Zeus, for life itself and for what is conducive to it,
	for dry fruits, for wine, for olive oil, give thanks unto God;
	and at the same time remember that He has given you
	something better than all these things—the faculty which
	can make use of them, pass judgement upon them, estimate
	the value of each. For what is that which, in the case
	of each of these faculties, shows what it is worth?[c dimgray][sup]112[/sup][/c] Is it

	[c dimgray][sup]110[/sup][/c]In Stoic physiology the spirit of vision connected the central
	mind with the pupil of the eye, and sight was produced by the
	action of this spirit upon external objects, not by the passive re- ception of rays. See L. Stein, [c dimgray]Psychologie der Stoa[/c] (1886), 127–9;

	[c dimgray][sup]111[/sup][/c]That is, firm, taut, elastic, so as to be sensitive to the action
	of the spirit of vision, and not dull and yielding like mud or putty.

	provoked by it or not? Is it not that of moral purpose? And
	this faculty of speech and of the adornment of language, if
	it really is a separate faculty, what else does it do, when
	discourse arises about some topic, but ornament and compose
	the words, as hairdressers do the hair? But whether
	it is better to speak than to keep silence, and to do so in
	this way, or in that, and whether this is appropriate or not
	appropriate, and the proper occasion and utility of each
	action—what else tells us all this but the faculty of moral
	purpose? Would you, then, have it come forward and condemn
	itself?

	“What then,” says an objector, “if the matter stands like

	be stronger than that which is unhindered? What are by

	by Epictetus. It is not impossible that the whole paragraph, §§ 16–19, is derived from a separate context and fitted in here
	rather badly by Arrian himself or by some ancient reader or editor,

	Nothing that lies outside its sphere, but only itself
	when perverted. For this reason moral purpose becomes
	the only vice, or the only virtue.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Therefore, since it is so great a faculty and has been set
	over everything else, let [c dimgray]it[/c] come before us and say that the
	flesh is of all things the most excellent. Nay, even if the
	flesh itself called itself most excellent, one would not have
	tolerated such a statement. But now what is it, Epicurus,
	that makes such a declaration? that composed the treatise
	[c dimgray]On the End, or The Physics,[/c] or [c dimgray]On the Standard?[/c][c dimgray][sup]114[/sup][/c] that
	caused you to let your beard grow long?[c dimgray][sup]115[/sup][/c] that wrote as it
	was dying: “We are spending what is our last and at the

	purpose? Come, do you confess that you have something
	superior to the flesh, and you are not insane, either? Are
	you, in all truth, so blind and deaf?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Well, what then? Does a man despise his other faculties?
	Far from it! Does a man say there is no use or advancement
	save in the faculty of moral purpose? Far from
	it! That is unintelligent, impious, ungrateful towards God.
	Nay, he is but assigning its true value to each thing. For

	was at the point of death, he wrote the following letter to Idomeneus:
	‘We have written this letter to you on a happy day to us,
	which is also the last day of our life. For strangury has attacked
	me, and also a dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to
	the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind,
	which arises from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplations,
	counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg you to
	take care of the children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of
	the devotion shown by the youth to me, and to philosophy.’ ”

	there is some use in an ass, but not as much as there is in

	is in a slave; there is use also in a slave, but not as much as
	there is in your fellow-citizens; there is use also in these,
	but not as much as there is in the magistrates. Yet because
	some things are superior we ought not to despise the use
	which the others give. There is a certain value also in the
	faculty of eloquence, but it is not as great as that of the
	faculty of moral purpose. When, therefore, I say this, let
	no one suppose that I am bidding you neglect speech, any
	more than I bid you neglect eyes, or ears, or hands, or feet,
	or dress, or shoes. But if you ask me, “What, then, is the
	highest of all things?” what shall I say? The faculty of eloquence?
	I cannot; but rather that of moral purpose, when
	it becomes a [c dimgray]right[/c] moral purpose. For it is this which uses
	not only that faculty of eloquence but also all the other

	But to do away with the faculty of eloquence and to say

	really is a faculty of this kind, we may not be able to despise

	between beauty and ugliness. What! could a man be affected
	in the same way by the sight of Thersites and that
	of Achilles? Or by the sight of Helen and that of some
	ordinary woman? But these are the notions of foolish and
	boorish persons who do not know the nature of each several
	thing, but are afraid that if a man notices the superiority
	of the faculty in question he will immediately be
	carried away by it and come off worsted. Nay, the great
	thing is this: to leave each in the possession of his own
	proper faculty, and, so leaving him, to observe the value of
	the faculty, and to learn what is the highest of all things,
	and in everything to pursue after this, to be zealous about
	this, treating all other things as of secondary value in comparison
	with it, thought without neglecting these, as far as
	this is possible. For we must take care of our eyes too, yet
	not as the highest thing, but we must take care of them for
	the sake of the highest; because this latter will not have its

	kinsmen, to do the duties of a citizen yourself, to marry,
	bring up children, hold the customary offices. For you did
	not come into the world to select unusually fine places, I
	ween, but to live and go about your business in the place
	where you were born and were enrolled as a citizen. Something
	like this takes place also in the matter which we are
	considering. Since a man must advance to perfection
	through the spoken word and such instruction as you receive
	here, and must purify his own moral purpose and
	correct the faculty which makes use of external impressions,
	and since the instruction must necessarily be given
	by means of certain principles, and in a particular style,
	and with a certain variety and impressiveness in the form
	of these principles, some persons are captivated by all
	these things and stay where they are; one is captivated by
	style, another by syllogisms, another by arguments with
	equivocal premisses, another by some other “inn” of that
	sort, and staying there they moulder away as though they
	were among the Sirens.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Man, your purpose was to make yourself competent to
	use conformably with nature the external impressions that
	came to you, in desire not to fail in what you would attain,
	and in avoidance not to fall into what you would avoid,
	never suffering misfortune, never ill fortune, free, unhindered,
	unconstrained, conforming to the governance of
	Zeus, obeying this, well satisfied with this, blaming no one,
	charging no one, able to say with your whole heart the
	verses, beginning:

	And then, although you have this purpose, because some
	petty trick of style, or certain principles, catch your fancy,
	are you going to stay just where you are and choose to dwell
	there, forgetful of the things at home and saying “This is
	fine?” Well, who says that it is not fine? But only like a
	passageway, like an “inn.” For what is to prevent a man
	having the eloquence of Demosthenes and yet being unhappy,
	and what is to prevent him from analyzing syllogisms
	like Chrysippus, and yet being wretched, from sorrowing,
	envying, in a word, from being disturbed and
	miserable? Absolutely nothing. You see, then, that these
	were “Inns” of no value, while your purpose was something
	else. When I speak thus to some people they think that I
	am disparaging the study of rhetoric or that of general
	principles. Yet I am not disparaging this, but only the habit
	of dwelling unceasingly on these matters and setting one’s
	hopes in them. If a man does his hearers harm by presenting
	this view, set me down too as one of those who work
	harm. But when I see that one thing is highest and supreme,
	I cannot say the same of something else, in order
	to gratify you, my hearers.

	I’ll follow and not falter; if my will
	Prove weak and craven, still I’ll follow on.
	They are derived from a poem of Cleanthes (Von Arnim, [c dimgray]Stoicorum
	Veterum Fragmenta[/c], I. frag. 527). For a somewhat indifferent
	translation of them into Latin, see Seneca, [c dimgray]Erist.[/c], 107.11, who adds as a fifth verse in the pointed style characteristic of him:
	[c dimgray]Ducunt volentem fata, nolentem trahunt.[/c] “The willing are led by
	fate, the reluctant dragged.” It is not impossible that the sentiment
	here expressed may be one of the remote and probably
	unconscious inspirations of Cardinal Newman’s celebrated hymn,
	“Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom/Lead Thou me
	on!” For his mind being haunted by “some texts of this kind,” [c dimgray]i.e.,[/c]
	that “God meets those who go in His way,” see Ward’s [c dimgray]Life of John

	[b][c dimgray]24. To one of those whom he did not deem worthy[/c][/b]
	Someone said to him: I have often come to you, wishing
	to hear you and you have never given me an answer; and
	now, if it be possible, I beg you to say something to me. He
	answered: Do you think that, just as in anything else there
	is an art, so there is also an art in speaking, and that he who
	has this art will speak with skill, while he who does not have
	it will speak without skill?—I do.—Then he who by speaking
	benefits himself and is able to benefit others would be
	speaking with skill, while he who confers injury rather than
	benefit would be without skill in this art of speaking? You
	would find that some are injured and others benefited.
	And are all those who hear benefited by what they hear, or
	would you find that of them too some are benefited but
	others injured?—Yes, that is true of them also, he
	said.—Then in this case too are all those that show skill in
	listening benefited, but all those that do not show such skill
	are injured?—He agreed.—Is there, therefore, also a certain
	skill in listening, just as there is in speaking?—So it
	seems.—But, if you please, look at the matter from this
	angle also: whose part do you think it is to handle an instrument
	musically?—The musician’s.—Very well, and
	whose part does it appear to you to be to make a statue
	properly?—The sculptor’s.—Does it appear to you to require
	no art to look at a statute with skill?—This also requires
	art.—If, then, to speak as one ought is the part of a
	skilled person, do you see that to hear with benefit to himself
	is also the part of the skilled person? Now as for perfection
	and benefit, if you please, let us drop the consideration
	of them for the present, since both of us are far

	for you? How can I? For do you really understand
	what a proof is, or how anything is demonstrated, or by

	speech also, when the suitable hearer appears, and when

	in the breast of a man? Does the vine say to the husbandman,
	“Pay attention to me?” Nay, but the vine by its very
	appearance shows that it will profit him to pay attention to

	treats both Agamemnon and Achilles with more civility than they

	had no undue reverence for the great figures of the Epic.

	to give, Epictetus said: Do you see how you yourself admit
	that all this instruction is necessary, if, without it, you cannot
	so much as know whether it is necessary or not?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]26. What is the distinctive characteristic of error?[/c][/b]
	Every error involves a contradiction. For since he who
	is in error does not wish to err, but to be right, it is clear that
	he is not doing what he wishes. For what does the thief
	wish to achieve? His own interest. Therefore, if thievery is
	against his interest, he is not doing what he wishes. Now
	every rational soul is by nature offended by contradiction;
	and so, as long as a man does not understand that he is
	involved in contradiction, there is nothing to prevent him
	from doing contradictory things, but when he has come to
	understand the contradiction, he must of necessity abandon
	and avoid it, just as a bitter necessity compels a man
	to renounce the false when he perceives that it is false; but
	as long as the falsehood does not appear, he assents to it as
	the truth.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He, then, who can show to each man the contradiction
	which causes him to err, and can clearly bring home to him
	how he is not doing what he wishes, and is doing what he
	does not wish, is strong in argument, and at the same time
	effective both in encouragement and refutation. For as
	soon as anyone shows a man this, he will of his own accord
	abandon what he is doing. But so long as you do not point
	this out, be not surprised if he persists in his error; for he
	does it because he has an impression that he is right. That

	Once, when he was visited by a young student of rhetoric whose hair was somewhat too elaborately dressed, and whose attire in general was highly embellished, Epictetus said: Tell me if you do not think that some dogs are beautiful, and some horses, and so every other creature.—I do, said the young man.—Is not the same true also of men, some of them are handsome, and some ugly?—Of course.—Do we, then, on the same grounds, pronounce each of these creatures in its own kind beautiful, or do we pronounce each beautiful on special grounds? I shall show you what I mean. Since we see that a dog is born to do one thing, and a horse another, and, if you will, a nightingale for something else, in general

	it would not be unreasonable for one to declare that each of them was beautiful precisely when it achieved supreme excellence in terms of its own nature; and, since each has a different nature, each one of them, I think, is beautiful in a different fashion. Is that not so?—He agreed.—Does it not follow, then, that precisely what makes a dog beautiful, makes a horse ugly, and precisely what makes a horse beautiful, makes a dog ugly, if, that is, their natures are different?—So it appears.—Yes, for, to my way of thinking, what makes a pancratiast[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] beautiful does not make a wrestler good, and, more than that, makes a runner quite absurd: and the same man who is beautiful for the pentathlon[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] is very ugly for wrestling?—That is so, said he.—What, then, makes a man beautiful other than just that which makes a dog or a horse beautiful in its kind?—Just that, said he.—What is it, then, that makes a dog beautiful? The presence of a dog’s excellence. What makes a horse beautiful? The presence of a horse’s excellence. What, then, makes a man beautiful? Is it not the presence of a man’s excellence? Very well, then, young man, do you too, if you wish to be beautiful, labour to achieve this, the excellence that characterizes a man.—And what is that?—Observe who they are whom you yourself praise, when you praise people dispassionately; is it the just, or the unjust?—The just;—is it the temperate, or the dissolute?—The temperate;—and is it the self-controlled, or the uncontrolled?—The self-controlled.—In making yourself that kind of person, therefore, rest assured that you will be making yourself

Here you are coming to me to get some benefit, and I shall be bestowing no benefit at all; and you are coming to me as to a philosopher, and I shall be saying nothing to you as a philosopher. Besides, is it anything but cruel for me to leave you unreformed? If some time in the future you come to your senses, you will have good reason to blame me: “What did Epictetus observe in me,” you will say to yourself, “that, although he saw me in such a condition and coming to him in so disgraceful a state, he should let me be so and say never a word to me? Did he so completely despair of me? Was I not young? Was I not ready to listen to reason? And how many other young fellows make any number of mistakes of the same kind in their youth? I am told that once there was a certain Polemo[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] who from being a very dissolute young man underwent such an astonishing transformation. Well, suppose he did not think that I should be another Polemo; he could at least have set my hair right, he could have stripped me of my ornaments, he could have made me stop plucking my hairs; but although he saw me looking like—what shall I say?—he held his peace.” As for me, I do not say what it is you look

	If you bring this charge against me some day, what shall I be able to say in my own defence? Yes; but suppose I speak and he not obey. And did Laius obey Apollo?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Did he not go away and get drunk and say good-bye to the oracle? What then? Did that keep Apollo from telling him the truth? Whereas I do not know whether you will obey me or not. Apollo knew perfectly well that Laius would not obey, and yet he spoke.—But why did he speak?—And why is he Apollo? And why does he give out oracles? And why has he placed himself in this position,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] to be a prophet and a fountain of truth, and for the inhabitants of the civilized world to come to him? And why are the words “Know thyself” carved on the front of his temple, although no one pays attention to them?

Nevertheless, once he had been assigned this post, as he himself says, by the ordinance of the Deity,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] he never abandoned it. Nay, what does he say even to his judges? “If you acquit me,” he says, “on these conditions, namely, that I no longer engage in my present practices, I will not accept your offer, neither will I give up my practices, but I will go up to young and old, and, in a word, to everyone that I meet, and put to him the same question that I put now, and beyond all others I will especially interrogate you,” he says, “who are

	“my nature” would seem to be more logical here (cf. Grant’s
	note on Aristotle’s [c dimgray]Ethics[/c], 2.1.3). But μου is supported by
	the precisely similar σου of § 30, which is if anything even
	more illogical. In the original remark of Diogenes, whom
	Epictetus is clearly quoting in § 30 (see the note at that
	point), ἐγκαλεῖν τῇ φύσει is used as it is normally in Greek.

And why do you care what we are about? “Why, what is that you are saying? You are my partner and kinsman, and yet you neglect yourself and provide the State with a bad citizen, and your kin with a bad kinsman, and your neighbours with a bad neighbour.” “Well, who are you?”
	Here it is a bold thing to say, “I am he who must needs take interest in men.” For no ordinary ox dares to withstand the lion himself;[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] but if the bull comes up and withstands him, say to the bull, if you think fit, “But who are you?” and “What do you care?” Man, in every species nature produces some superior individual, among cattle, dogs, bees, horses. Pray do not say to the superior individual, “Well, then, who are you?” Or if you do, it will get a voice from somewhere and reply to you, “I am the same sort of thing as red in a mantle;[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] do not expect me to resemble the rest, and do not blame my nature[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] because it has made me different from the rest.”

	you, but I shall say: Young man, whom do you wish to make beautiful? First learn who you are, and then, in the light of that knowledge, adorn yourself. You are a human being; that is, a mortal animal gifted with the ability to use impressions rationally. And what is “rationally”? In accordance with nature and perfectly. What element of superiority, then, do you possess? The animal in you? No. Your mortality? No. Your ability to use impressions? No. Your reason is the element of superiority which you possess; adorn and beautify that; but leave your hair to Him who fashioned it as He willed. Come, what other designations apply to you? Are you a man or a woman?—A man.—Very well then, adorn a man, not a woman. Woman is born smooth and dainty by nature, and if she is very hairy she is a prodigy, and is exhibited at Rome among the prodigies. But for a man [c dimgray]not[/c] to be hairy is the same thing, and if by nature he has no hair he is a prodigy, but if he cuts it out and plucks it out of himself, what shall we make of him? Where shall we exhibit him and what notice shall we post? “I will show you,” we say to the audience, “a man who wishes to be a woman rather than a man.” What a dreadful spectacle! No one but will be amazed at the notice; by Zeus, I fancy that even the men who pluck out their own hairs do what they do without realizing what it means. Man, what reason have you to complain against your nature?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Because it brought you into the world as a man?[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] What then? Ought it to have brought all persons into the world

Your paltry body[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] doesn’t please you, eh? Make a clean sweep of the whole matter; eradicate your—what shall I call it?—the cause of your hairiness; make yourself a woman all over, so as not to deceive us, not half-man and half-woman. Whom do you wish to please? Frail womankind? Please them as a man. “Yes, but they like smooth men.”
	Oh, go hang! And if they liked sexual perverts, would you have become such a pervert? Is this your business in life, is this what you were born for, that licentious women should take pleasure in you? Shall we make a man like you a citizen of Corinth,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and perchance a warden of the city, or superintendent of ephebi,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] or general, or superintendent of the games? Well, and when you have married are you going to pluck out your hairs? For whom and to what end?

	“Try, then, to be beautiful.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] What does he tell him? “Dress your locks and pluck the hairs out of your legs?” God forbid! No, he says, “Make beautiful your moral purpose, eradicate your worthless opinions.” How treat your paltry body, then? As its nature is. This is the concern of Another;[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] leave it to Him.—What then? Does the body have to be left unclean?—God forbid! but the man that you are and were born to be, keep that man clean, a man to be clean as a man, a woman as a woman, a child as a child. No, but let’s pluck out also the lion’s mane, so that he may not fail to be “cleaned up,” and the cock’s comb, for he too ought to be “cleaned up”![c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Clean? Yes, but clean as a cock, and the other clean as a lion, and the hunting dog clean as a hunting dog!

	There are three fields of study[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] in which the man who is going to be good and excellent must first have been trained. The first has to do with desires and aversions, that he may never fail to get what he desires, nor fall into what he avoids; the second

	with cases of choice and of refusal, and, in general, with duty, that he may act in an orderly fashion, upon good reasons, and not carelessly; the third with the avoidance of error and rashness in judgement, and, in general, about cases of assent. Among these the most important and especially pressing is that which has to do with the stronger emotions; for a strong emotion does not arise except a desire fails to attain its object, or an aversion falls into what it would avoid.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] This is the field of study which introduces to us confusions, tumults, misfortunes and calamities; and sorrows, lamentations, envies;[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and makes[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] us envious and jealous—passions which make it impossible for us even to listen to reason. The second field of study deals with duty; for I ought not to be unfeeling like a statue, but should maintain my relations, both natural and acquired, as a religious man, as a son, a brother, a father, a citizen.

	The third belongs only to those who are already making progress; it has to do with the element of certainty in the matters which have just been mentioned, so that even in dreams, or drunkenness, or a state of melancholy-madness, a man may not be taken unawares by the appearance of an untested sense-impression.—This, says someone, is beyond us.—But philosophers nowadays pass by the first and second fields of study, and concentrate upon the third, upon arguments which involve equivocal premisses, which derive syllogisms by the process of interrogation, which involve hypothetical premisses,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	the one who is already good and excellent.—Do
	you, then, fall short in this? Have you already attained perfection in the other subjects? Are you proof against deception in handling small change? If you see a pretty wench, do you resist the sense-impression? If your neighbour receives an inheritance, do you not feel a twinge of envy? And is security of judgement now the only thing in which you fall short? Wretch, even while you are studying these very topics you tremble and are worried for fear someone despises you, and you ask whether anybody is saying anything about you. And if someone should come and say, “A discussion arising as to who was the best of the philosophers, someone who was there said that So-and-so was the only real philosopher,” immediately your poor little one-inch soul shoots up a yard high.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] But if another party to the discussion says, “Nonsense, it’s a waste of time to listen to So-and-so. Why, what does he know? He has the rudiments, but nothing else,” you are beside yourself, you grow pale, immediately you shout, “I’ll show him who I am, that I am a great philosopher!” Yet we see what a man is by just such conduct. Why do you wish to show it by anything else? Do you not know that Diogenes[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] showed one of the sophists thus, pointing out his middle finger at him,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and then when the man was furious with rage, remarked, “That’s So-and-so; I’ve pointed him out to you.” For a man is not

	something like a stone or a stick of wood to be pointed out with a finger, but when one shows a man’s judgements, then one shows him as a man.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Let us take a look at your judgements too. Is it not evident that you set no value on your own moral purpose, but look beyond to the things that lie outside the province of the moral purpose, namely, what So-and-so will say, and what impression you will make, whether men will think you a scholar, or that you have read Chrysippus or Antipater? Why, if you have read them and Archedemus too, you have everything! Why are you any longer worried for fear you will not show us who you are? Do you wish me to tell you what kind of a man you have shown us that you are? A person who comes into our presence[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] mean, hypercritical, quick-tempered, cowardly, finding fault with everything, blaming everybody, never quiet, vain-glorious; these are the qualities which you have exhibited to us. Go away now and read Archedemus; then if a mouse falls down and makes a noise, you are dead with fright. For the same kind of death awaits you that carried off—what’s his name?—oh, yes, Crinus.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] He, too, was proud of himself because he could understand Archedemus. Wretch, are you not willing to let alone those things that do not concern you? They are appropriate for those who can study them without disturbance of spirit, who have the right to say, “I do not yield to anger, or sorrow, or envy; I am not subject to restraint, or to compulsion. What do I yet lack? I enjoy leisure, I have peace of mind. Let us see how we ought to deal with equivocal

	The subject-matter with which the good and excellent man has to deal is his own governing principle, that of a physician and the masseur is the body, of a farmer is his farm; but the function of the good and excellent man is to deal with his impressions in accordance with nature. Now just as it is the nature of every soul to assent to the true, dissent from the false, and to withhold judgement in a matter of uncertainty, so it is its nature to be moved with desire toward the good, with aversion toward the evil, and feel neutral toward what is neither evil nor good. For just as neither the banker nor the greengrocer may legally refuse the coinage of Caesar, but if you present it, whether he will or no, he must turn over to you what you are purchasing with it, so it is also with the soul. The instant the good appears it attracts the soul to itself, while the evil repels the soul from itself. A soul will never refuse a clear sense-impression of good,

	any more than a man will refuse the coinage of Caesar. On this concept of the good hangs every impulse to act both of man and of God.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	That is why the good is preferred above every form of kinship. My father is nothing to me, but only the good. “Are you so hard-hearted?” Yes, that is my nature. This is the coinage which God has given me. For that reason, if the good is something different from the noble and the just, then father and brother and country and all relationships simply disappear. But shall I neglect my good, so that you may have it, and shall I make way for you? What for? “I am your father.” But not a good.
	“I am your brother.” But not a good. If, however, we define the good as consisting in a right moral purpose, then the mere preservation of the relationships of life becomes a good; and furthermore, he who gives up some of the externals achieves the good. “My father is taking away my money.”
	But he is doing you no harm. “My brother is going to get the larger part of the farm.” Let him have all he wants. That does not help him at all to get a part of your modesty, does it, or of your fidelity, or of your brotherly love? Why, from a possession of this kind who can eject you? Not even Zeus. Nay, nor did He even wish to, but this matter He put under my control, and He gave it to me even as He had it Himself, free from hindrance, compulsion, restraint.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When, therefore, different persons have different pieces of coinage, a man offers the coin and gets what is bought by it. A thief has come to the province as Proconsul. What coinage does he use? Silver. Offer it and carry away what you wish. An adulterer

	It is chiefly with this principle in mind that a man must exercise himself. Go out of the house at early dawn, and no matter whom you see or whom you hear, examine him and then answer as you would to a question. What did you see? A handsome man or a handsome woman? Apply your rule. Is it outside the province of the moral purpose, or inside? Outside. Away with it. What did you see? A man in grief over the death of his child? Apply your rule. Death lies outside the province of the moral purpose. Out of the way with it. Did a Consul meet you? Apply your rule. What sort of thing is a consulship? Outside the province of the moral purpose, or inside? Outside. Away with it, too, it does not meet the test; throw it away, it does not concern you. If we had kept doing this and had exercised ourselves from dawn till dark with this principle in mind,—by the gods, something would have been achieved! But as it is, we are caught gaping straightway at every external impression that comes along, and we wake up a little only during the lecture, if indeed we do so even then.

Let a man but transfer his judgements to matters that lie within the province of the moral purpose, and I guarantee that he will be steadfast, whatever be the state of things about him.

	The soul is something like a bowl of water, and the external impressions something like the ray of light that falls upon the water. Now when the water is disturbed, it looks as though the ray of light is disturbed too, but it is not disturbed. And so, therefore, when a man has an attack of vertigo, it is not the arts and the virtues that are thrown into confusion, but the spirit in which they exist; and when this grows steady again, so do they too.

	The Procurator of Epirus took the side of a comic actor in a somewhat undignified manner and was reviled by the people for doing so. Thereupon he brought word to Epictetus that he had been reviled,

	and gave expression to his indignation at the men who had so reviled him. Why, what wrong were they doing? said Epictetus. They too were taking sides, just as you yourself were. But when the other asked, Is that the way, then, in which a man takes sides? he replied, Yes, they saw you, their Governor, the friend and Procurator of Caesar, taking sides in this way, and weren’t they likely to take sides themselves in the same way? Why, if people should not take sides in this way, you had better not do so yourself; but if they should, why are you angry if they imitated you? For whom have the people to imitate but you, their superior? Whom do they look to but you, when they go to the theatres? “See,” says one of them, “how the Procurator of Caesar acts in the theatre; he shouts; very well, I’ll shout too. He jumps up and down; I’ll jump up and down too. His claque of slaves sit in different parts of the house and shout, whereas I haven’t any slaves; very well, I’ll shout as loud as I can to make up for all of them,” You ought to know, then, that when you enter the theatre, you enter as a standard of behaviour and as an example to the rest, showing them how they ought to act in the theatre. Why, then, did they revile you? Because every man hates what stands in his way. They wanted So-and-so to get the crown, while you wanted the other man to get it. They were standing in your way, and you in theirs. You turned out to be the stronger; they did what they could, and reviled what was standing in their way. What, then, do you wish? That you should be able to [c dimgray]do[/c] what you wish, but that they should not even [c dimgray]say[/c] what they wish? And what is there

Isn’t Caesar informed of what is said? What, then, does he do? He knows that if he punishes all who revile him he will have no one left to rule over. What then? Ought you upon entering the theatre to say, “Come, let’s see that Sophron gets the crown”? and not rather, “Come, let me in this subject-matter maintain my moral purpose in accord with nature”? No one is dearer to me than myself; it is absurd, therefore, for me to let myself be hurt in order that another man may win a victory as a comic actor.—Whom, then, do I wish to win the victory? The victor; and so the one whom I wish to win the victory will always win it.—But I wish Sophron to get the crown.—Stage as many contests as you will in your own house, and proclaim him victor in the Nemean, Pythian, Isthmian, and Olympic games; but out in public do not arrogate to yourself more than your due, and do not filch away a public privilege. Otherwise you must put up with being reviled; because, when you do the same things that the people do, you are putting yourself on their level.

	at home? Do you not raise the question whether you are doing here any of the things that have a bearing upon your moral purpose, so that it shall be improved? For if you are not accomplishing anything, it was no use for you to have come in the first place. Go back and tend to your affairs at home. For if your governing principle cannot be brought into conformity with nature, no doubt your paltry piece of land can be made to conform with it.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] You will increase the amount of your small change; you will care for your father in his old age, you will walk up and down in the market, you will hold office; a poor wretch yourself, you will do wretchedly whatever comes next. But if you understand yourself, namely, that you are putting away certain bad judgements and taking on others in their place, and that you have transferred your status from what lies outside the province of the moral purpose to what lies inside the same, and that if ever you say “Alas!” you are speaking, not for your father’s sake, or your brother’s sake, but “for my own sake,” then why take account of illness any longer? Do you not know that disease and death needs must overtake us, no matter what we are doing? They overtake the farmer at his work in the fields, the sailor on the sea. What do you wish to be doing when it overtakes you? For no matter what you do you will have to be overtaken by death. If you have anything better to be doing when you are so overtaken, get to work on that.

And now it is Thy will that I leave this festival; I go, I am full of gratitude to Thee that Thou hast deemed me worthy to take part in this festival with Thee, and to see Thy works, and to understand Thy governance.” Be this my thought, this my writing, this my reading, when death comes upon me.

	which labour has been expended in our time, progress also will be found in our time. The fact is that in our time labour has been expended upon the solution of syllogisms, and there is progress along that line; but in the early days not only had labour been expended upon maintaining the governing principle in a state of accord with nature, but there was also progress along that line. Do not, therefore, substitute one thing for the other, and do not expect, when you devote labour to one thing, to be making progress in another. But see whether any one of us who is devoting himself to keeping in a state of conformity with nature, and to spending his life so, fails to make progress. For you will find that there is none of whom that is true.

	The good man is invincible; naturally, for he enters no contest where he is not superior. “If you want my property in the country,” says he, “take it; take my servants, take my office, take my paltry body. But you will not make my desire fail to get what I will, nor my aversion fall into what I would avoid.” This is the only contest into which the good man enters, one, namely, that is concerned with the things which belong in the province of the moral purpose; how, then, can he help but be invincible?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When someone asked him what “general perception”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] was, he replied, Just as a sense of hearing which distinguishes merely between sounds would be called “general,” but that which distinguishes between tones is no longer “general,” but “technical,” so there are certain things which those men who are not altogether perverted see by virtue of their general faculties. Such a mental constitution is called “general perception.”

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]On the use of the term κοινὸς νοῦς in Epictetus one may
	compare Benhöffer, [c dimgray]Epiktet und die Stoa[/c], 121 and 224. It
	means simply the intellectual faculty that any normal man
	possesses.

	It is not an easy thing to prevail upon soft young men; no, and you can’t catch soft cheese on a fishhook[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] either—but the gifted young men, even if you try to turn them away, take hold of reason all the more firmly. And so also Rufus for the most part tried to dissuade men, using such efforts to dissuade as a means of discriminating between those who were gifted and those who were not. For he used to say, “Just as a stone, even if you throw it upwards, will fall downwards to earth by virtue of its very constitution, so is also the gifted man; the more one beats him back, the more he inclines toward his natural object.”

	[b] A conversation with the Imperial Bailiff[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] of the Free Cities, who was an Epicurean[/b]
	When the Imperial Bailiff, who was an Epicurean, came to visit him, Epictetus said: It is proper for us laymen to make inquiry of you philosophers what the best thing in the world is—just as those who have come to a strange town make inquiry of the citizens and people who are familiar with the place—so that, having learned what it is, we may go in quest of it ourselves and behold it, as do strangers with the sights in the cities. Now that three things belong to man, soul, and body, and things external, hardly anyone denies; all you have to do, then, is to

	ἁπαλός (“soft”) is used of the cheese, which Wolf and Upton,

	that is the kinds of cheese which is meant.

	answer the question, Which is the best? What are we going to tell men? The flesh? And was it for this that Maximus[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] sailed all the way to Cassiope[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] during the winter with his son, to see him on his way? Was it to have pleasure in the flesh? When the other had denied that and said “God forbid!”
	Epictetus continued: Is it not proper to have been very zealous for that which is best?—It is certainly most proper.—What have we better, then, than the flesh?—The soul, said he.—Are the goods of the best thing better, or those of the inferior?—Those of the best thing.—Do goods of the soul belong in the sphere of the moral purpose, or do they not?—To the sphere of the moral purpose.—Is the pleasure of the soul, therefore, something that belongs in this sphere?—He agreed.—At what is this produced? At itself?[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] But that is inconceivable. For we must assume that there is already in existence a certain antecedent essence of the good, by partaking of which we shall feel pleasure of soul.—He agreed to this also.—At what, then, are we going to feel this pleasure of soul? If it is at the goods of the soul, the essence of the good has already been discovered. For it is impossible that one thing be good, and yet that it is justifiable for us to take delight in something else; nor again, that when the antecedent is not good the consequent be good; because, in order to justify the consequent, the antecedent must be good. But say not so, you Epicureans, if you are in your right mind; for you will be saying what is inconsistent both with Epicurus and with the rest of

	That is why Maximus acted foolishly if he made his voyage for the sake of anything but the flesh, that is, for the sake of anything but the best And a man acts foolishly too, if, when he is judge and able to take the property of other men, he keeps his hands off it. But, if you please, let us consider this point only, that the stealing be done secretly, safely, without anybody’s knowledge. For even Epicurus himself does not declare the act of theft evil, but only getting caught, and merely because it is impossible to feel certain that one will not be detected, he says, “Do not steal.” But I tell you that if it is done adroitly and circumspectly, we shall escape detection; besides that, we have influential friends in Rome, both men and women; and the Greeks are a feeble folk, none of them will have the courage to go up to Rome for that purpose. Why refrain from your own good? This is foolish, it is silly. And again, I shall not believe you, even if you tell me that you do refrain. For just as it is impossible to assent to what is seen to be false, and to reject what is true, so it is impossible to reject what is seen to be good. Now wealth is a good, and when it comes to pleasures is, so to speak, the thing most productive of them. Why should you not acquire it? And why should we not seduce our neighbour’s wife, if we can escape detection? And

	In the name of God, I ask you, can you imagine an Epicurean State? One man says, “I do not marry.” “Neither do I,” says another, “for people ought not to marry.” No, nor have children; no, nor perform the duties of a citizen. And what, do you suppose, will happen then? Where are the citizens to come from? Who will educate them? Who will be superintendent of the ephebi,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] or gymnasium director? Yes, and what will either of these teach them? What the young men of Lacedaemon or Athens were taught? Take me a young man; bring him up according to your doctrines. Your doctrines are bad, subversive of the State, destructive to the family, not even fit for women. Drop these doctrines, man. You live in an imperial State; it is your duty to hold office, to judge uprightly, to keep your hands off the property of other people; no woman but your wife ought to look handsome to you, no boy handsome, no silver plate handsome, no gold plate. Look for doctrines consistent with these principles of conduct, doctrines which will enable you to refrain gladly from matters so persuasive to attract and to overpower a man.

	In a piece of plate what is the best thing, the silver or the art? The substance of the hand is mere flesh, but the important thing is the works of the hand. Now duties are of three kinds; first, those that have to do with mere existence, second, those that have to do with existence of a particular sort, and third, the principal duties themselves.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] So also in the case of man, it is not his material substance that we should honour, his bits of flesh, but the principal things. What are these? The duties of citizenship, marriage, begetting children, reverence to God, care of parents,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] in a word, desire, avoidance, choice, refusal, the proper performance of each one of these acts, and that is, in accordance with our nature. And what is our nature? To act as free men, as noble, as self-respecting. Why, what other living being blushes, what other comprehends the impression of shame? And it is our nature to subordinate pleasure to these duties as their servant, their minister, so as to arouse our interest and keep us acting in accordance with nature.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The classification of duties in this sentence is obscure, and the commentators have ever been in straits both to elucidate it, and to explain what bearing it has upon the
	context. The first two classes (which are essentially one)
	deal with outward existence; the last touches our higher
	nature. A full discussion of this matter will be found in
	A. Bonhöffer; [c dimgray]Die Ethik des Stoikers Epiktet[/c], p. 205–6. A
	very similar Stoic division of duties into five classes, where
	the third class of Epictetus is triply divided, will be found in
	Cicero, [c dimgray]De Finibus[/c], III. 16 and 20. I believe that the sentence,
	though probably going back to Epictetus, did not belong here originally (so also Bonhöffer, it seems), but derived from a marginal note upon τὰ προηγούμενα, just below, and the sentence immediately following.

	gold and silver plate are enough to satisfy you; what do you need doctrines for?—Yes, but I sit too as judge over the Hellenes.—Do you know how to sit as judge? What has brought you to know that?—Caesar wrote credentials for me.—Let him write you credentials that will allow you to sit as a judge in music and literature; and what good will it do you? However this may be, there is another question, and that is, how did you come to be a judge? Whose hand did you kiss—that of Symphorus or that of Numenius?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] In front of whose bedroom door did you sleep?[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] To whom did you send presents? After all, don’t you recognize that the office of judge is worth exactly as much as Numenius is?—But I can throw whom I will into prison.—As you can a stone.—But 1 can have beaten to death with a club whom I will.—As you can an ass.—That is not governing men. Govern us as rational beings by pointing out to us what is profitable, and we will follow you; point out what is unprofitable, and we will turn away from it. Bring us to admire and emulate you, as Socrates brought men to admire and emulate him. He was the one person who governed people as men, in that he brought them to subject to him their desire, their aversion, their choice, their refusal. “Do this; do not do this; otherwise I will throw you into prison.” Say that, and yours ceases to be a government as over rational beings. Nay, rather, say, “As Zeus has ordained, do this; if you do not do so, you will be punished, you will suffer injury.” What kind of injury? No injury but that of not doing what you ought; you will destroy the man of fidelity in you, the man of honour, the man of

	[b][c dimgray]How ought we to exercise ourselves to deal with the impressions of our senses?[/c][/b]
	As we exercise ourselves to meet the sophistical interrogations, so we ought also to exercise ourselves daily to meet the impressions of our senses, because these too put interrogations to us. So-and-so’s son is dead. Answer, “That lies outside the sphere of the moral purpose, it is not an evil.” His father has disinherited So-and-so; what do you think of it? “That lies outside the sphere of the moral purpose, it is not an evil.” Caesar has condemned him. “That lies outside the sphere of the moral purpose, it is not an evil.” He was grieved at all this. “That lies within the sphere of the moral purpose, it is an evil.” He has borne up under it manfully. “That lies within the sphere of the moral purpose, it is a good.” Now if we acquire this habit, we shall make progress; for we shall never give our assent to anything but that of which we get a convincing sense-impression.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] His son is dead. What happened? His son is dead. Nothing else? Not a thing. His ship is lost. What happened? His ship is lost. He was carried off to prison. What happened? He was carried off to prison. But the observation: “He has fared ill,” is an addition that

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The φαντασία καταληπτική, a term peculiar to Stoic
	psychology, is “an impression so distinct and vivid and
	consistent and permanent as to carry its own conviction of
	certainty and to be its own criterion of truth” (P. E. More,
	[c dimgray]Hellenistic Philosophies[/c], 85). See Bonhöffer, [c dimgray]Epiktet und die
	Stoa,[/c] 160–7, 228–32. Among recent writers E. R. Bevan,
	[c dimgray]Stoics and Sceptics[/c], 36, renders the phrase “grasping impression”;
	G. Murray, [c dimgray]The Stoic Philosophy[/c], 27 and 44,
	“comprehensive sense-impression.” Cf. R. M. Wenley, [c dimgray]Stoicism,[/c] 87, for the metaphor in the adjective: “Conviction of truth must . . . involve an unshakable grip upon the actual.”

	Hear how the Romans feel about philosophers, if you care to know.

	There came in to visit Epictetus one day a man who was on his way to Rome, where he was engaged in a lawsuit involving an honour to be bestowed on him.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Compare I. 9, 20; III. 13, 14, and Vol. I. p. xxv f.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]For the particular expression here, see II. 6, 22.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]The sense of this curious and apparently quite detached
	anecdote, which has puzzled some scholars, seems to be that
	the otherwise quite unknown Italicus, who was clearly not a
	philosopher [c dimgray]propria persona[/c], but merely enjoyed some local
	reputation among people at Rome for dabbling in philosophy,
	was being urged by his friends to submit to some hardship
	in a truly philosophic manner, and resented the implication
	that he actually [c dimgray]was[/c] a philosopher like the mean and humble
	slave or freedman Epictetus. Roman popular feeling about philosophy is probably not greatly overdrawn in the well-known advice of Ennius (frag. sc. 376 Vahlen) to taste of philosophy, but not to gorge oneself upon it; and the jest of Plautus ([c dimgray]Captivi,[/c] 284), apropos of a reckless romancer, that
	“he is not simply lying now, he is philosophizing.”
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]The situation seems a bit strange to us, but the famous lawsuit between Aeschines and Ctesiphon, in which Demosthenes delivered the oration [c dimgray]De Corona,[/c] technically, indeed, in behalf of Ctesiphon, but actually in his own cause, offers a close parallel.

	Epictetus asked what the reason was for the trip to the Capital, and the man proceeded to ask what opinion he had about the matter. If you ask me [c dimgray]what[/c] you are going to [c dimgray]do[/c] in Rome, says Epictetus, whether you will succeed or fail, I have no precept to offer. If, however, you ask [c dimgray]how[/c] you are going to [c dimgray]fare,[/c] I have this to say: If you have sound judgements, you will fare well; if unsound judgements, ill; since in every case the way a man fares is determined by his judgement.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] For what is it that made you eager to be elected patron of the people of Cnossos?[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Your judgement.

Do we all, then, have sound judgements, both you and your opponent? If so, then how do you come to disagree? But do you have sound judgements rather than he? Why? You think so. So does he, and so do madmen. This is a poor criterion. But show me that you have made any study of your own judgements and have paid attention to them. And as now you are sailing to Rome so as to become patron of the men of Cnossos, and you are not satisfied to stay at home and keep the honours which you had, but you have set your heart upon something greater and more conspicuous, so did you ever make a voyage for the purpose of studying your own judgements, and of rejecting one,

	if it is unsound? Whom have you ever visited for this purpose? What time have you set yourself, what period of your life? Review the periods of your life, all to yourself, if you are ashamed to do so before me. When you were a boy were you in the habit of examining your judgements? Did you not habitually do what you then did just as you do everything now? And when you grew to be a youth and were attending the lectures of the rhetoricians, and were yourself practising, what did you fancy that you yet lacked? And when you were a young man and began to take part in politics, and to plead cases yourself, and to have a good reputation, who any longer seemed in your eyes to be your equal? Would you under any circumstances have submitted to be put through an examination on the charge that you had wretched judgements? Very well then, what do you wish me to say to you?—Help me in this affair.—I have no precepts to offer for this; and you too, if you came to me for this purpose, have not come to me as to a philosopher, but as to a vegetable-dealer, as to a cobbler.—To what end, then, do philosophers have precepts to offer?—To this end, that whatever happen, our governing principle shall be, and abide to the end, in accord with nature. Do you regard that as a trifle?—No; it is of the utmost moment.—What then? Does this require only a little time, and is it possible to acquire it on a passing visit? Acquire it, then, if you can!

	understand the other’s judgements, and in his turn exhibits his own. Learn to know my judgements; show me your own, and then say you have met me. Let us put one another to the test; if I cherish any evil judgement, take it away; if you cherish one, bring it forward. That is what it means to meet a philosopher. Oh no; but your way is: “We are passing, and while we are hiring our ship, we have a chance to take a look at Epictetus; let’s see what in the world he has to say.” Then you leave with the remark: “Epictetus was nothing at all, his language was full of solecisms and barbarisms.” What else were you capable of judging, when you came in like that?

	“But,” says someone, “if I devote myself to these things, I shall not own a farm any more than you do, I shall not have silver goblets any more than you, or fine cattle any more than you.” To all this it is perhaps enough to answer: “I do not need them; but you, even if you acquire many possessions, need still others, and whether you will or not, are more poverty-stricken than I am.”—What, then, do I need?—What you do not have; steadfastness, your mind in a state of conformity with nature, freedom from vexation of spirit. Patron or not patron, what do I care? But you care. I am richer than you are; I am not worried about what Caesar is going to think of me; I flatter no man for that purpose. All this is what I have as an offset to your silver plate, and your gold plate. You have furnishings of gold, but your reason, your judgements, your assent, your choice, your desire—of earthenware. But when I have these in a state of conformity with nature, why should I not take up logic also as a sort of hobby?

	For, I have plenty of leisure; my mind is not being dragged this way and that. What shall I do, seeing there is nothing that disturbs me? What have I which more becomes a man than this? You and your kind when you have nothing to do are restless, go to the theatre, or wander up and down aimlessly. Why should not the philosopher develop his own reason? You turn to vessels of crystal, I to the syllogism called “The Liar”;[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] you to myrrhine ware,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] I to the syllogism called “The Denyer.”[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Everything that you already have seems small in your sight, but everything that I have seems important to me. Your strong desire is insatiate, mine is already satisfied. The same thing happens to the children who put their hand down into a narrow-necked jar and try to take out figs and nuts: if they get their hand full, they can’t get it out, and then they cry. Drop a few and you will get it out. And so do you too drop your desire; do not set your heart upon many things and you will obtain.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	And keep these verses on hand to use, not by way of exclamations, as we cry, “Paean Apollo!”
	Again, in a fever have ready the judgements which apply to that. Let us not, if we fall into a fever, abandon and forget all our principles, saying: “If I ever study philosophy again, let anything happen that will! I’ll have to go away somewhere and take care of my poor body.” Yes indeed, if fever does not go there too![c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] But what is philosophy? Does it not mean making preparation to meet the things that come upon us? Do you not understand, then, that what you are saying amounts to something like this: “If I ever again prepare to bear quietly the things that come upon me, let anything happen that will”?

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The sense of this difficult and corrupt passage seems to be that Epictetus sarcastically approves the plan, with, however, the proviso, that there be no fever where his interlocutor plans to go; which was impossible, because there was no such place. In other words, one cannot avoid hardships by changing one’s residence; therefore, prepare to meet them wherever you are.

	It is just as if a man should give up the pancratium[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] because he has received blows. The only difference is that in the pancratium a man may stop, and so avoid a severe beating, but in life, if we stop the pursuit of philosophy, what good does it do? What, then, ought a man to say to himself at each hardship that befalls him? “It was for [c dimgray]this[/c] that I kept training, it was to meet [c dimgray]this[/c] that I used to practise.”
	God says to you, “Give Me proof, whether you have striven lawfully,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] eaten what is prescribed,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] taken exercise, heeded your trainer.” After that, do you flinch when the time for action arrives? Now it is time for your fever, let it come upon you in the right way; for thirst, bear your thirst in the right way; to go hungry, bear hunger in the right way. It is not in your power, you say? Who is there to prevent you? Nay, your physician will prevent you from drinking, but he cannot prevent you from thirsting in the right way; and he will prevent you from eating, but he cannot prevent you from bearing hunger in the right way.

	But am I not a scholar?—And for what purpose do you devote yourself to scholarship? Slave, is it not that you may be happy? Is it not that you may be secure? Is it not that you may conform to nature and live your life in that way. What prevents you, when you have a fever, from having your governing principle conform with nature? Here is the proof of the matter, the test of the philospher. For this too is a part of life; like a stroll, a voyage, a journey, such is also a fever, I presume you do not read while taking a stroll, do you?—No.—No more than when you have a fever. But if you stroll in the right way, you perform what is expected of a stroller;

	if you have fever in the right way, you perform the things expected of the man who has a fever. What does it mean to have fever in the right way? Not to blame God, or man, not to be overwhelmed by what happens to you, to await death bravely and in the right way, to do what is enjoined upon you; when your physician comes to see you, not to be afraid of what he will say, and at the same time not to be carried away with joy, if he says, “You are doing splendidly”; for what [c dimgray]good[/c] to you lay in that remark? Why, when you were well, what [c dimgray]good[/c] was it to you? It means not to be downhearted, too, if he says, “You are in a bad way.” For what does it mean to be in a bad way? That you are close to a separation of the soul from the body. What, then, is terrifying about that? If you do not draw near now, will you not draw near later? And is the universe going to be upset when you die? Why, then, do you wheedle your physician? Why do you say, “If you wish, Master, I shall get well”? Why do you give him occasion to put on airs? Why not give him just what is his due? As I give the shoemaker his due about my foot, the builder his due about my house, so also the physician his due about my paltry body, something that is not mine, something that is by nature dead.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] These are the things that the moment demands for a man who is in a fever; if he meets these demands, he has what properly belongs to him. For it is not the business of the philosopher to guard these external matters—neither
	his paltry wine, nor his paltry oil, nor his paltry body—but what? His own governing principle. And how treat externals? Only so far as not to act thoughtlessly about them. What proper occasion is

	there, then, any longer for fear? What proper occasion, then, any longer for anger? Or for fear about things that are not his own concern, worthless things? For here are the two principles that you ought to have ready at hand: Outside the sphere of the moral purpose there is nothing either good or bad; and, We ought not to lead events, but to follow them. “My brother ought not to have treated me so.” No; but it is for him to look to that. As for me, no matter how he behaves, I shall observe all my relations to him as I ought. For this is my part, the other does not belong to me; in this nobody can hinder me, the other is subject to hindrance.

	There are certain punishments, assigned as it were by law, for those who are disobedient to the divine dispensation. “Whoever shall regard as good anything but the things that fall within the scope of his moral purpose, let him envy, yearn, flatter, feel disturbed; whoever shall regard anything else as evil, let him sorrow, grieve, lament, be unhappy.”
	Nevertheless, for all that we are so severely punished, we cannot desist.

	This, then, is what one should have ready to use in the case of a father: “I may not rightfully dishonour a father, not even if a worse man than art thou should come; for of Zeus, the God of Fathers,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] are they all”; and so in the case of a brother: “For of Zeus, the God of Kindred, are they all.” And similarly, in the other social relations, we shall find Zeus overseeing them all.

	[b][c dimgray]Of training[/c][/b]
	We ought not to take our training in things that are unnatural or fantastic, since in that case we who profess to be philosophers will be no better than the mountebanks. For it is a hard thing also to walk a tight-rope, and not merely hard but dangerous too. Ought we also for this reason to practise walking a tight-rope, or setting up a palm, or throwing our arms about statues?[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Not a bit of it. Not every difficult and dangerous thing is suitable for training, but only that which is conducive to success in achieving the object of our effort. And what is the object of our effort? To act without hindrance in choice and in aversion. And what does this mean? Neither to fail to get what we desire, nor to fall into what we would avoid. Toward this end, therefore, our

	etc.[/c], p. 1116; and especially A. B. Cook, [c dimgray]Zeus[/c] (index).
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]“Setting up a palm” may possibly mean climbing a pole
	with only the hands and the feet, like the climbers of palms, as
	Upton and Schweighäuser (after Bulinger) suggest. There was a “palm-bearer” (φοινεικοφόρος, or σπαδεικοφόρος) connected with the gymnasium at Tegea in Arcadia ([c dimgray]I.G.[/c] V. 2, Nos. 47, 48, 50, 53), who possibly had charge of the exercise referred to here, whatever its exact character may have been. As for embracing statues, Diogenes was said to have done that nude in cold weather, so as to harden himself. Diog. Laert. 6, 23.

	training also should tend. For since it is impossible without great and constant training to secure that our desire fail not to attain, and our aversion fell not into what it would avoid, be assured that, if you allow training to turn outwards, towards the things that are not in the realm of the moral purpose, you will have neither your desire successful in attaining what it would, nor your aversion successful in avoiding what it would. And since habit is a powerful influence, when we have accustomed ourselves to employ desire and aversion only upon these externals, we must set a contrary habit to counteract this habit, and where the very slippery nature of sense-impressions is in play, there we must set our training as a counteracting force.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I am inclined to pleasure; I will betake myself to the opposite side of the rolling ship, and that beyond measure, so as to train myself. I am inclined to avoid hard work; I will strain and exercise my sense-impressions to this end, so that my aversion from everything of this kind shall cease. For who is the man in training? He is the man who practises not employing his desire, and practises employing his aversion only upon the things that are within the sphere of his moral purpose, yes, and practises particularly in the things that are difficult to master. And so different men will have to practise particularly to meet different things. To what purpose is it, then, under these conditions, to set up a palm tree, or to carry around a leather tent, or a mortar and pestle?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Man, practise, if you are

	carried about with them such equipment ostentatiously to

	shelter and the simplest utensils to prepare grain for food,
	somewhat as Diogenes was content with his [c dimgray]pithos[/c] and a cup
	(although eventually he discarded even the latter). But it
	must be confessed that the passage is very obscure. Seneca,
	[c dimgray]De ira[/c], 2, 12, speaks somewhat disparagingly of [c dimgray]ille qui[/c] [c dimgray]meditatus est . . . sarcinae ingenti cervices supponere[/c] (that is, “the man who has practised carrying about enormous burdens on his back”), pretty clearly in reference to this same custom, but without throwing much light upon it.

Then you will make such progress, that, even if someone strikes you, you will say to yourself, “Imagine that you have thrown your arms about a statue. “Next train yourself to use wine with discretion, not with a view to heavy drinking (for there are some clumsy fools who practise with this in mind), but first for the purpose of achieving abstention from wine, and keeping your hands off a wench, or a sweet-cake. And then some day, if the occasion for a test really comes, you will enter the lists at a proper time for the sake of discovering whether your sense-impressions still overcome you just as they did before. But first of all flee far away from the things that are too strong for you.

For, just as Socrates used to tell us not to live a life unsubjected to examination,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] so we ought not to accept a sense-impression unsubjected to examination, but should say, “Wait, allow me to see who you are and whence you come”[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] (just as the night-watch say, “Show me your

	A forlorn state is the condition of one who is without help. For a man is not forlorn merely because he is alone, any more than a man in the midst of a crowd is necessarily not forlorn. At all events, when we have lost a brother, or a son, or a friend with whom we have shared the same bed, we say that we have been left forlorn, though often we are in Rome, with such large crowds meeting us in the streets, and so many people living in the same

	house with us, and sometimes even though we have a multitude of slaves. For according to the nature of the concept the ‘forlorn’ means the person who is without help, and exposed to those who wish to injure him. That is why, when we go on a journey, we call ourselves forlorn most especially at the moment that we encounter robbers. For it is not the sight of a human being as such which puts an end to our forlorn condition, but the sight of a faithful, and unassuming, and helpful human being. Why, if being alone is enough to make one forlorn, you will have to say that even Zeus himself is forlorn at the World-Conflagration,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and bewails himself: “Wretched me! I have neither Hera, nor Athena, nor Apollo, nor, in a word, brother, or son, or grandson, or kinsman.” There are even those who say that this is what he does when left alone at the World-Conflagration; for they cannot conceive of the mode of life of one who is all alone, starting as they do from a natural principle, namely, the facts of natural community of interest among men, and mutual affection, and joy in intercourse. But one ought none the less to prepare oneself for this also, that is, to be able to be self-sufficient, to be able to commune with oneself; even as Zeus communes with himself, and is at peace with himself, and contemplates the character of his governance, and occupies himself with ideas appropriate to himself, so ought we also to be able to converse with ourselves, not to be in need of others, not to be at a loss for

	Behold now, Caesar seems to provide us with profound peace, there are no wars any longer, nor battles, no brigandage on a large scale, nor piracy, but at any hour we may travel by land, or sail from the rising of the sun to its setting. Can he, then, at all provide us with peace from fever too, and from shipwreck too, and from fire, or earthquake, or lightning? Come, can he give us peace from love? He cannot. From sorrow? From envy? He cannot—from absolutely none of these things. But the doctrine of the philosophers promises to give us peace from these troubles too. And what does it say? “Men, if you heed me, wherever you may be, whatever you may be doing, you will feel no pain, no anger, no compulsion, no hindrance, but you will pass your lives in tranquillity and in freedom from every disturbance.” When a man has this kind of peace proclaimed to him, not by Caesar—why, how could [c dimgray]he[/c] possibly proclaim it?—but proclaimed by God through the reason, is he not satisfied, when he is alone? When he contemplates and reflects, “Now no evil can befall me, for me there is no such thing as a brigand, for me there is no such thing as an earthquake, everything is full of peace, everything

Another,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] whose care it is, supplies food; Another supplies raiment; Another has given senses; Another preconceptions. Now whenever He does not provide the necessities for existence, He sounds the recall; He has thrown open the door and says to you, “Go.” Where? To nothing you need fear, but back to that from which you came, to what is friendly and akin to you, to the physical elements.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] What there was of fire in you shall pass into fire, what there was of earth into earth, what there was of spirit into spirit, what there was of water into water. There is no Hades, nor Acheron, nor Cocytus, nor Pyriphlegethon, but everything is filled with gods and divine powers.”[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] A man who has this to think upon, and who beholds the sun, and moon, and stars, and enjoys land and sea, is no more forlorn than he is without help. “Why, what then?

Practise at some one time a style of living like an invalid, that at some other time you may live like a healthy man.

And if you do so with good reason, whenever you have some good in you, you will exercise your desire aright.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] No, that’s not our way, but we wish to live like wise men from the very start, and to help mankind. Help indeed! What are you about? Why, have you helped yourself? But you wish to help them progress. Why, have you made progress yourself? Do you wish to help them? Then show them, by your own example, the kind of men philosophy produces, and stop talking nonsense.

	As the good chorus-singers in tragedy cannot render solos, but can sing perfectly well with a number of other voices, so some men cannot walk around by themselves. Man, if you are anybody, both walk around by yourself, and talk to yourself, and don’t hide yourself in the chorus. Let yourself be laughed at sometimes, look about you, shake yourself up, so as to find out who you actually are.

	Whenever a man drinks water only, or has some ascetic practice, he takes every opportunity to talk about it to everybody: “I drink water only.” Why, do you drink water just for the sake of drinking water? Man, if it is good for you to drink water, drink it! Otherwise your conduct is absurd. But if it does you good and you drink water only, don’t say a word about it to the people who are annoyed by such persons. Why, what’s your object? Are these just the ones you wish to please?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

	Here are two things of which one must rid men, conceit and diffidence. Now conceit is to fancy that one needs nothing further. And diffidence is to assume that one cannot enjoy a life of serenity

Now conceit is removed by cross-examination, and this is what Socrates starts with. . . .[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] But that the matter is not impossible, consider and search—this kind of search will do you no harm; and, indeed, to philosophize practically amounts to this, that is, to search how it is possible to employ desire and aversion without hindrance.

	“I am superior to you, for my father has consular rank.”[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Another says, “I have been a tribune, and you have not.” And if we were horses, you would be saying: “My sire was swifter than yours,” or, “I have quantities of barley and fodder,” or, “I have pretty neck-trappings.” What then, if, when you were talking like this, I said, “Granted all that, let’s run a race, then”? Come now, is there, then, nothing in man like running in the case of a horse, whereby the worse and the better will be recognized? Isn’t there such a thing as reverence, faith, justice? Prove yourself superior in these points, in order to be superior as a human being.

	[b][c dimgray]That we ought to approach each separate thing with circumspection[/c][/b]
	In each separate thing that you do consider the matters which come first, and those which follow after, and only then approach the thing itself. Otherwise, at the start you will come to it enthusiastically because you have never reflected upon any of the subsequent steps, but later on, when some of them appear, you will give up disgracefully. “I wish to win an Olympic victory. “But consider the matters which come before that and those which follow after; and only when you have done that, then, if it profits you, put your hand to the task. You have to submit to discipline, follow a strict diet, give up sweet-cakes, train under compulsion, at a fixed hour, in heat or in cold; you must not drink cold water,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] nor wine just whenever you feel like it; you must have turned yourself over to your trainer precisely as you would to a physician. Then when the contest comes on, you have to “dig in” beside[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] your opponent, sometimes dislocate your wrist, sprain your ankle, swallow quantities of sand, take a scourging;[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] yes, and then sometimes get beaten along with all that. After you have counted up these points, go on into the games, if you still wish to; otherwise, I would have you observe that you will be turning back like children. Sometimes they play athletes, again gladiators, again they blow trumpets, and then act a play about anything that they have seen and admired. So you too are now

	an athlete, now a gladiator, then a philosopher, after that a rhetorician, yet with your whole soul nothing, but like an ape you imitate whatever you see, and one thing after another is always striking your fancy, but what you are accustomed to bores you. For you have never gone out after anything with circumspection, nor after you have examined the whole matter all over and tested it, but you act at haphazard and half-heartedly.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] In the same way, when some people have seen a philosopher and heard someone speaking like Euphrates[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] (though, indeed, who can speak like him?), they wish to be philosophers themselves. Man, consider first what the business is, and then your own natural ability, what you can bear. If you wish to be a wrestler, look to your shoulders, your thighs, your loins. For one man has a natural talent for one thing, another for another. Do you suppose that you can do the things you do now, and yet be a philosopher? Do you suppose that you can eat in the same fashion, drink in the same fashion, give way to anger and to irritation, just as you do now? You must keep vigils, work hard, overcome certain desires, abandon your own people, be despised by a paltry slave, be laughed to scorn by those who meet you, in everything get the worst of it, in office, in honour, in court. Look these drawbacks over carefully, and then, if you think best, approach philosophy, that is, if you are willing at the price of these things to secure tranquillity, freedom, and calm. Otherwise, do not approach; don’t act like

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Although the expression (lit. “with cold desire”) seems
	a bit strange, because the fault seems to lie especially in the
	lack of forethought and circumspection, still it is supported
	by the version in the [c dimgray]Encheiridion[/c], and particularly by the
	phrase, “yet with your whole soul nothing,” in § 6 above.

	regarded by Epictetus as a weak thing.

	the person who is covered with soot to keep from getting some soot on himself. For what are you going to do if he talks about gladiators, or horses, or athletes, or, worse still, about people: “So-and-so is bad, So-and-so is good; this was well done, this ill”; or again, if he scoffs, or jeers, or shows an ugly disposition? Has any of you the capacity of the expert lyre-player when he takes up his lyre, which enables him, the instant he touches the strings, to recognize the ones which are off pitch, and to tune the instrument? Or the power that Socrates had, which enabled him in every kind of social intercourse to bring over to his own side those who were in his company? How could you have? But you must necessarily be converted by the laymen.

	Why, then, are they stronger than you are? Because their rotten talk is based on judgements, but your fine talk comes merely from your lips; that’s why what you say is languid and dead, and why a man may well feel nausea when he hears your exhortations and your miserable “virtue,” which you babble to and fro. And thus the laymen get the better of you; for everywhere judgement is strong, judgement is invincible. Therefore, until these fine ideas of yours are firmly fixed within you, and you have acquired some power which will guarantee you security, my advice to you is to be cautious about joining issue with the laymen; otherwise whatever you write down in the lecture-room will melt away by day like wax in the sun.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Retire, then, to some spot or other far away from the sun, so long as the ideas which you have are waxen. It is for this reason that the philosophers advise us to leave even

	our own countries, because old habits distract us and do not allow a beginning to be made of another custom, and we cannot bear to have men meet us and say, “Look, So-and-so is philosophizing, although he is this sort of a person or that.” Thus also physicians send away to a different region and a different climate those who are suffering from chronic disorders, and that is well. Do you also introduce different habits; fix your ideas, exercise yourselves in them. But no, you go from the class-room to a show, a gladiatorial combat, a gymnasium-colonnade,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] a circus; and then you come back here from these places, and you go back there again from here, and remain the same persons all the time.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] And so you acquire no fine habit; you pay no regard or attention to your own self; you do not observe: “How do I deal with the external impressions which befall me? In accordance with nature, or contrary to it? How shall I respond to these impressions? As I should, or as I should not? Do I declare to the things which lie outside the sphere of my moral purpose that they mean nothing to me?” Why, if you have not yet acquired this state of mind, flee from your former habits, flee from the laymen, if you would begin to be somebody some time.

	“but the wicked man is better off.” In what respect? In money; for in respect to that he is superior to you, because he flatters, is shameless, lies awake nights. What is surprising in that? But look rather and see if he is better off than you are in being faithful, and considerate. For you will not find that to be the case; but where you are superior, there you will find that you are better off than he is. And so I once asked a man who was complaining about the prosperity of Philostorgus, “Would you have been willing to cohabit with Sura?”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] “May that day never come!” said he. Why, then, are you indignant if he gets something for what he sells? Or how can you deem him blessed who acquires what he has by means which you abhor? Or what harm does Providence do if it gives the better thing to the better men? Or is it not better to be considerate than to be rich? He agreed that it was. Why, then, are you indignant, man, when you have the better part? I would have the rest of you always remember, then, and be ready to apply the following truth: That this is a law of nature for the superior to have the better of the inferior, in the respect in which he is superior; and then you will never be indignant. “But my wife treats me badly.” Very well; if someone asks you what this amounts to, say, “My wife treats me badly.” “Nothing else, then?” Nothing. “My father doesn’t give me anything”. . .[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] But is it necessary in your own mind to add to the preceding statement, that to receive nothing from your father

	[b][c dimgray]That we ought not to allow any news to disturb us[/c][/b]
	Whenever some disturbing news is reported to you, you ought to have ready at hand the following principle: News, on any subject, never falls within the sphere of the moral purpose. Can anyone bring you word that you have been wrong in an assumption or in a desire?—By no means.—But he can bring you word that someone is dead. Very well, what is that to you? That someone is speaking ill of you. Very well, what is that to you? That your father is making certain preparations. Against whom? Surely not against your moral purpose, is it? Why, how can he? But against your paltry body, against your paltry possessions; you are safe, it is not against you. But the judge condemns you on the charge of impiety. And did not the judges similarly condemn Socrates? Surely it is no concern of yours that the judge pronounced you guilty, is it?—No.—Why,
	then, are you any further concerned? Your father has a certain function, and if he does not perform it, he has destroyed the father in him, the man who loves his offspring, the man of gentleness within him. Do not seek to make him lose anything else on this account. For it never happens that a man goes wrong in one thing, but is injured in

Otherwise, you have destroyed within you the son, the respectful man, the man of honour. What then? Is the judge secure? No; but he too runs just as great a risk. Why, then, are you afraid of what decision he is going to render? What have you to do with another man’s evil? Your own evil is to make a bad defence; only guard against that, but just as being condemned or not being condemned is another’s function, so it is another’s evil. “So-and-so threatens you.” Me? No. “He blames you.”

	The first difference between a layman and a philosopher: The one says, “Woe is me because of my child, my brother, woe because of my father”; and the other, if he can ever be compelled to say, “Woe is me,” adds, after a pause, “because of myself.” For nothing outside the sphere of the moral purpose can hamper or injure the moral purpose; it alone can hamper or injure itself.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]On this point see the Introduction, Vol. I, p. xx:
	“Every man bears the exclusive responsibility himself for
	his own good or evil, since it is impossible to imagine a
	moral order in which one person does the wrong and another,
	the innocent, suffers”; or, as here, where a person might do
	wrong in the moral sphere, and yet not suffer also in the
	moral sphere. Compare also the note on I. 28, 10, in Vol. I. This general position, which as an unverifiable postulate underlies the whole Stoic philosophy, and is the very starting-point of their whole system of thinking, is what might be styled the πρῶτον ψεῦδος of Stoicism.

But as it is, we have taken a different course from the start. Even while we were still children, our nurse, if ever we bumped into something, when we were going along with our mouths open, did not scold us, but used to beat the stone. Why, what did the stone do? Ought it to have moved out of the road because of your childish folly? And again, if we when children don’t find something to eat after our bath, our attendant never checks our appetite, but he cudgels the cook. Man, we didn’t make you the cook’s attendant, did we? but our child’s. Correct him, help him. So, even when we have grown up, we look like children.

	that the false is false. So it ought to be, then, also with our life. Is health a good, and illness an evil? No, man. What then? To be well for a good end is good, to be well for an evil end is evil.—So that it is possible to derive advantage even from illness, you mean?—Why, I call God to witness, isn’t it possible to derive advantage from death? Why, isn’t it possible from lameness?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Do you think that Menoeceus[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] derived but little good when he died?—May the one who says anything like that derive the same sort of good that he did!—Ho, there, man, did he not maintain the patriot that he was, the high-minded man, the man of fidelity, the man of honour? And had he lived on, would he not have lost all these? Would he not have won the very opposite? Would he not have acquired the character of the coward, the ignoble man, the disloyal, the lover of his own life? Come now, do you think that Menoeceus derived but little good by his death? Oh, no! But the father of Admetus derived great good from living so ignobly and wretchedly, did he? Why, didn’t he die later? Make an end, I adjure you by the gods, of admiring material things, make an end of turning yourselves into slaves, in the first place, of things, and then, in the second place, on their account, slaves also of the men who are able to secure or to take away these things.

	greatest. So also my reviler becomes one who prepares me for my contest; he exercises my patience, my dispassionateness, my gentleness. You say: No. But the man who lays hold of my neck and gets my loins and my shoulders into proper shape helps me, and the rubber does well when he says, “Lift the pestle with both hands,”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and the heavier it is, the more good I get out of doing so; whereas, if a man trains me to be dispassionate, does he do me no good? Your attitude means that you do not know how to derive advantage from men. Is your neighbour bad? Yes, for himself; but for me he is good; he exercises my good disposition, my fair-mindedness. Is your father bad? Yes, for himself; but for me he is good. This is the magic wand of Hermes. “Touch what you will, “the saying goes, “and it will turn into gold.”
	Nay, but bring whatever you will and I will turn it into a good. Bring disease, bring death, bring poverty, reviling, peril of life in court; all these things will become helpful at a touch from the magic wand of Hermes. “What will you make of death?” Why, what else but make it your glory, or an opportunity for you to show in deed thereby what sort of person a man is who follows the will of nature. “What will you make of disease?” I will show its character, I will shine in it, I will be firm, I will be serene, I will not fawn upon my physician, I will not pray for death. What else do you still seek? Everything that you give I will turn into something blessed, productive of happiness, august, enviable.

	Not so you; but, “Watch out that you don’t get ill; it’s bad.” Just as if someone said, “Watch out that you never get the impression that three are four; it’s bad.” Man, how do you mean “bad”? If I get the right idea of it, how is it going to hurt me any more? Will it not rather even do me good? If, then, I get the right idea about poverty, or disease, or not holding office, am I not satisfied? Will they not be helpful to me?

	you have digested these principles, show us some change in your governing principle that is due to them; as the athletes show their shoulders as the results of their exercising and eating, and as those who have mastered the arts can show the results of their learning. The builder does not come forward and say, “Listen to me deliver a discourse about the art of building”; but he takes a contract for a house, builds it, and thereby proves that he possesses the art. Do something of the same sort yourself too; eat as a man, drink as a man, adorn yourself, marry, get children, be active as a citizen; endure revilings, bear with an unreasonable brother, father, son, neighbour, fellow-traveller. Show us that you can do these things, for us to see that in all truth you have learned something of the philosophers. No, but “Come and listen to me deliver my comments,” you say. Go to! Look for people on whom to throw up! “Yes, but I will set forth to you the doctrines of Chrysippus as no one else can; his language I will analyse so as to make it perfectly clear; possibly I will throw in a bit of the vivacity of Antipater and Archedemus.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

	will be approaching holy rites, and holy rites of great antiquity. Only thus do the Mysteries become helpful, only thus do we arrive at the impression that all these things were established by men of old time for the purpose of education and for the amendment of our life. But you are publishing the Mysteries abroad and vulgarizing them, out of time, out of place, without sacrifices, without purification; you do not have the dress which the hierophant ought to wear, you do not have the proper head of hair, nor head-band, nor voice, nor age; you have not kept yourself pure as he has, but you have picked up only the words which he utters, and recite them. Have the words a sacred force all by themselves?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	One ought to approach these matters in a different fashion; the affair is momentous, it is full of mystery, not a chance gift, nor given to all comers. Nay, it may be that not even wisdom is all that is needed for the care of the young; one ought also to have a certain readiness and special fitness for this task, by Zeus, and a particular physique, and above all the counsel of God advising him to occupy this office, as God counselled Socrates to take the office of examining and confuting men, Diogenes the office of rebuking men in a kingly manner, and Zeno that of instructing men and laying down doctrines. But you are opening up a doctor’s office although you possess no equipment other than drugs, but when or how these drugs are applied you neither know nor have ever taken the trouble to learn. “See,” you say,
	“that man has these eye-salves, and so have I.”
	Have you, then, at all the faculty of using them aright? Do you know at all when and how and for

	whom they will do good? Why, then, do you play at hazard in matters of the utmost moment, why do you take things lightly, why do you put your hand to a task that is altogether inappropriate for you? Leave it to those who are able to do it, and do it with distinction. Do not yourself by your own actions join the number of those who bring disgrace upon philosophy, and do not become one of those who disparage the profession. If, however, you find the principles of philosophy entertaining, sit down and turn them over in your mind all by yourself, but don’t ever call yourself a philosopher, and don’t allow anyone else to say it of you, but say, rather,
	“He is mistaken; for my desire is no different from what it used to be, nor my choice, nor my assent, nor, in a word, have I changed at all, in my use of external impressions, from my former state.” Think this and say this about yourself, if you wish to think aright. If not, keep on playing at hazard and doing what you are doing now; for it becomes you.

	[b] On the calling of a Cynic[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c][/b]
	When one of his acquaintances, who seemed to have an inclination to take up the calling of a Cynic, asked him what sort of a man the Cynic ought to be, and what was the fundamental conception of his calling, Epictetus said: We will consider it at leisure; but I can tell you this much, that the man who lays
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The Cynics were the intransigent and uncompromising
	moralists, resembling the holy men, asceties, and dervishes
	of the Orient. Epictetus idealizes them somewhat in this
	discourse, regarding them as a kind of perfected wise men, like some of the early Christian anchorites, but points out very clearly that their style of life was not practicable for every man, indeed not even for one so humble and frugal as he himself was.

	his hand to so great a matter as this without God, is hateful to Him, and his wish means nothing else than disgracing himself in public. For in a well-ordered house no one comes along and says to himself, “I ought to be manager of this house”; or if he does, the lord of the mansion, when he turns around and sees the fellow giving orders in a high and mighty fashion, drags him out and gives him a dressing down. So it goes also in this great city, the world; for here also there is a Lord of the Mansion who assigns each and every thing its place. “[c dimgray]You[/c] are the sun; you have the power, as you make the circuit of the heavens, to produce the year and the seasons, to give increase and nourishment to the fruits, to stir and to calm the winds, and to give warmth in moderation to the bodies of men; arise, make the circuit of the heavens, and so set in motion all things from the greatest to the least. [c dimgray]You[/c] are a calf; when a lion appears, do what is expected of you; otherwise you will smart for it. [c dimgray]You[/c] are a bull; come on and fight, for this is expected of you, it befits you, and you are able to do it. [c dimgray]You[/c] are able to lead the host against Ilium; be Agamemnon. [c dimgray]You[/c] are able to fight a duel with Hector; be Achilles.” But if Thersites came along and claimed command, either he would not have got it, or if he had, he would have disgraced himself in the presence of a multitude of witnesses.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So do you also think about the matter carefully; it is not what you think it is. “I wear a rough cloak even as it is, and I shall have one then; I have a hard bed even now, and so I shall then; I shall take to myself a wallet and a staff,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and I shall

	begin to walk around and beg from those I meet, and revile them; and if I see someone who is getting rid of superfluous hair by the aid of pitch-plasters, or has a fancy cut to his hair, or is strolling about in scarlet clothes, I will come down hard on him.” If you fancy the affair to be something like this, give it a wide berth; don’t come near it, it is nothing for you. But if your impression of it is correct, and you do not think too meanly of yourself, consider the magnitude of the enterprise that you are taking in hand.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	First, in all that pertains to yourself directly you must change completely from your present practices, and must cease to blame God or man; you must utterly wipe out desire, and must turn your aversion toward the things which lie within the province of the moral purpose, and these only; you must feel no anger, no rage, no envy, no pity; no wench must look fine to you, no petty reputation, no boy-favourite, no little sweet-cake. For this you ought to know: Other men have the protection of their walls and their houses and darkness, when they do anything of that sort, and they have many things to hide them. A man closes his door, stations someone at the entrance to his bedroom:
	“If anyone comes, tell him ‘He is not at home, he is not at leisure.’” But the Cynic, instead of all these defences, has to make his self-respect his protection; if he does not, he will be disgracing himself naked and out of doors. His self-respect is his house, his door, his guards at the entrance to his bedroom, his darkness. For neither ought he to wish to keep concealed anything that is his (otherwise he is lost, he has destroyed the Cynic

For where will he conceal himself, or how? And if this instructor of us all, this “pedagogue,”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] chance to get caught,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] what must he suffer! Can, then, a man who is afraid of all this continue with all his heart to supervise the conduct of other men? It cannot be done, it is impossible.

	In the first place, then, you must make your governing principle pure, and you must make the following your plan of life: “From now on my mind is the material with which I have to work, as the carpenter has his timbers, the shoemaker his hides; my business is to make the right use of my impressions. My paltry body is nothing to me; the parts of it are nothing to me. Death? Let it come when it will, whether it be the death of the whole or some part. Exile? And to what place can anyone thrust me out? Outside the universe he cannot. But wherever I go, there are sun, moon, stars, dreams, omens, my converse with gods.”

	The word is also used of getting caught in a trap, Xenophon
	[c dimgray]Mem.[/c] II. 1, 4: τοῖς θηράτροις ἐμπίπτουσι. That is probably the original form of expression from which the intransitive use derives. Schenkl (not Schweighäuser, to whom I owe the above references to Hesychius and Xenophon) appears to me to be wrong in rendering the word “decipior,” although Matheson is inclined to follow him. Capps suggests that
	“the κοινὸς παιδευτής is God,” and that ἐμπέσῃ means “break in upon.” But that might be somewhat inconsistent with ἀπὸ τυχῆς, which seems hardly appropriate of an action on the part of God.

You who look upon their estate from the outside and are dazzled by the external appearance, or the men themselves? What do [c dimgray]they[/c] say?

	the true nature of the good, to which it was born, and of the true nature of the evil, and of what is its own proper possession, and what is none of its own concern. And whenever some one of these things that are none of its own concern is in a bad way, it says, “Woe is me, for the Greeks are in danger.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Ah, miserable governing principle, the only thing neglected and uncared for! “They are going to perish, slain by the Trojans.” But if the Trojans do not kill them, will they not die anyway? “Yes, but not all at once.”
	What difference does it make, then? For if death is an evil, whether they die all at once, or die one at a time, it is equally an evil.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Nothing else is going to happen, is it, but the separation of the paltry body from the soul? “Nothing.” And is the door closed for you, if the Greeks perish? Are you not permitted to die? “I am.” Why, then, do you grieve? “Woe is me, a king, and holding the sceptre of Zeus!”A king does not become unfortunate any more than a god becomes unfortunate.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] What are you, then? Truly a shepherd![c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] for you wail as the shepherds do when a wolf carries off one of their sheep; and these men over whom you rule are sheep.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Specifically alluding to the position of Agamemnon in
	the situation referred to above.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]This is a distinct over-statement of the case. Obviously
	it makes a great deal of difference for a State (and it is in
	his capacity as head of a State that Agamemnon is here
	appearing), whether its fighting men are killed all at once,
	or die one at a time in the course of nature.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Presumably a king is expected to commit suicide before
	becoming “unfortunate,” as suggested in § 34. If he survived
	under the circumstances here described, he certainly
	must be “unfortunate,” at least as a man, in any ordinary
	sense of the term. Capps, however, thinks the meaning of
	Epictetus to be that a king [c dimgray]qua[/c] king, that is, while really
	holding the sceptre of Zeus, is blessed of fortune. If “unfortunate”
	he is simply not such a king. This refinement would be similar to the well-known argument concerning the “ruler [c dimgray]qua[/c] ruler,” in the first book of Plato’s [c dimgray]Republic.[/c] The more common-sense view of the case is well expressed by the Scholiast on Homer’s [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] XI. 438, thus: “A king is unfortunate when his subjects fare ill.”
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]Referring to the common Homeric designation of a ruler as the “shepherd of the folk.”
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]Capps proposes the novel view that ἤρχου is from ἄρχομαι, and “takes up ἀρχόμενοι \[35\] . . . Agamemnon, by allowing himself to be dominated by an ἀλλότριον πρᾶγμα, has become a subject, a sheep.”

	Lo, these are words that befit a Cynic, this is his character, and his plan of life. But no, you say, what makes a Cynic is a contemptible wallet, a staff, and big jaws; to devour everything you give him, or to stow it away, or to revile tactlessly the people he meets, or to show off his fine shoulder. Do you see the spirit in which you are intending to set your hand to so great an enterprise? First take a mirror, look at your shoulders, find out what kind of loins and thighs you have. Man, it’s an Olympic contest in which you are intending to enter your name, not some cheap and miserable contest or other. In the Olympic games it is not possible for you merely to be beaten and then leave; but, in the first place, you needs must disgrace yourself in the sight of the whole civilized world, not merely before the men of Athens, or Lacedaemon, or Nicopolis; and, in the second place, the man who carelessly gets up and leaves[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] must needs be flogged, and before he is flogged he has to suffer thirst, and scorching heat, and swallow quantities of wrestler’s sand.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Think the matter over more carefully, know yourself, ask the Deity, do not attempt the task without God. For if God so advises you, be assured that He wishes you either to become great, or to receive many stripes. For this too is a very pleasant strand woven into the Cynic’s pattern of life; he must needs be flogged like an ass, and while he is being flogged he must love the men who flog him, as though he were the father or brother of them all. But that is not your way. If someone flogs you, go stand in the midst and shout, “O Caesar, what do I

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Meibom’s conjecture, εἰσελθόντα, which is sometimes
	accepted, would mean, “The man who carelessly enters the
	contest.” But the punishment of flogging would probably be
	reserved for the person who failed to appear finally in the
	lists, since everyone had to have a month’s preliminary training on the spot, during which time those who had entered would suffer the inconveniences described below.

	have to suffer under your peaceful rule? let us go before the Proconsul.” But what to a Cynic is Caesar, or a Proconsul, or anyone other than He who has sent him into the world, and whom he serves, that is, Zeus? Does he call upon anyone but Zeus? And is he not persuaded that whatever of these hardships he suffers, it is Zeus that is exercising him? Nay, but Heracles, when he was being exercised by Eurystheus, did not count himself wretched, but used to fulfil without hesitation everything that was enjoined upon him: and yet is this fellow, when he is being trained and exercised by Zeus, prepared to cry out and complain? Is he a man worthy to carry the staff of Diogenes? Hear [c dimgray]his[/c] words to the passers-by as he lies ill of a fever:[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] “Vile wretches,” he said, “are you not going to stop?

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]An ancient scholiast, probably Arethas (cf. Schenkl[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c],
	p. lxxx), remarks at this point, that Epictetus had probably
	read the Gospels and Jewish literature. But this particular
	passage does not furnish any very cogent argument, for the
	evidence adduced, namely the injunctions about “turning
	the other cheek” and “loving your enemies” ([c dimgray]Matth.[/c] 5, 39
	and 44), has nothing in common with the somewhat vain- glorious speech of Diogenes. Probably, however, the scholium actually belongs at § 54, where there is, indeed, a certain resemblance. Fairly apposite, also, is the citation of [c dimgray]James[/c] 1, 2: πᾶσαν χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε, ἀδελφοί, ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε ποικίλοις, in connection with the next sentence.

	brilliant style? Come, what says Diogenes about poverty, death, hardship? How did he habitually compare his happiness with that of the Great King?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Or rather, he thought there was no comparison between them. For where there are disturbances, and griefs, and fears, and ineffectual desires, and unsuccessful avoidances, and envies, and jealousies—where
	is there in the midst of all this a place for happiness to enter? But wherever worthless judgements are held, there all these passions must necessarily exist.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And when the young man asked whether he, as a Cynic, should consent, if, when he had fallen ill, a friend asked him to come to his house, so as to receive proper nursing, Epictetus replied: But where will you find me a Cynic’s friend? For such a person must be another Cynic, in order to be worthy of being counted his friend. He must share with him his sceptre[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and kingdom, and be a worthy ministrant, if he is going to be deemed worthy of friendship, as Diogenes became the friend of Antisthenes,
	and Crates of Diogenes. Or do you think that if a man as he comes up greets the Cynic, he is the Cynic’s friend, and the Cynic will think him worthy to receive him into his house? So if that is what you think and have in mind, you had much better look around for some nice dunghill, on which to have your fever, one that will give you shelter from the north wind, so that you won’t get chilled. But you give me the impression of wanting to go into somebody’s house for a while and to get filled up. Why, then, are you even laying your hand to so great an enterprise?

	be undertaken by the Cynic as a matter of prime importance?—If, replied Epictetus, you grant me a city of wise men, it might very well be that no one will lightly adopt the Cynic’s profession. For in whose interest would he take on this style of life? If, nevertheless, we assume that he does so act, there will be nothing to prevent him from both marrying and having children; for his wife will be another person like himself, and so will his father-in-law, and his children will be brought up in the same fashion. But in such an order of things as the present, which is like that of a battle-field, it is a question, perhaps, if the Cynic ought not to be free from distraction, wholly devoted to the service of God, free to go about among men, not tied down by the private duties of men, nor involved in relationships which he cannot violate and still maintain his role as a good and excellent man, whereas, on the other hand, if he observes them, he will destroy the messenger, the scout, the herald of the gods, that he is. For see, he must show certain services to his father-in-law, to the rest of his wife’s relatives, to his wife herself; finally, he is driven from his profession, to act as a nurse in his own family and to provide for them. To make a long story short, he must get a kettle to heat water for the baby, for washing it in a bath-tub; wool for his wife when she has had a child, oil, a cot, a cup (the vessels get more and more numerous); not to speak of the rest of his business, and his distraction.

	Where, pray, is this king, whose duty it is to oversee the rest of men; those who have married; those who have had children; who is treating his wife well, and who ill; who quarrels; what household is stable, and what not; making his rounds like a physician, and feeling pulses? “You have a fever, you have a headache, you have the gout. You must abstain from food, you must eat, you must give up the bath; you need the surgeon’s knife, you the cautery.” Where is the man who is tied down to the duties of everyday life going to find leisure for such matters? Come, doesn’t he have to get little cloaks for the children? Doesn’t he have to send them off to a school-teacher with their little tablets and writing implements, and little notebooks; and, besides, get the little cot ready for them? For [c dimgray]they[/c] can’t be Cynics from the moment they leave the womb. And if he doesn’t do all this, it would have been better to expose them at birth, rather than to kill them in this fashion. See to what straits we are reducing our Cynic, how we are taking away his kingdom from him.—Yes, but Crates married.—You
	are mentioning a particular instance which arose out of passionate love, and you are assuming a wife who is herself another Crates. But our inquiry is concerned with ordinary marriage apart from special circumstances,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and from this point of view we do not find that marriage, under present conditions, is a matter of prime importance for the Cynic.

	How, then, said the young man, will the Cynic still be able to keep society going?—In the name of God, sir, who do mankind the greater service?

	Those who bring into the world some two or three ugly-snouted children to take their place, or those who exercise oversight, to the best of their ability, over all mankind, observing what they are doing, how they are spending their lives, what they are careful about, and what they undutifully neglect? And were the Thebans helped more by all those who left them children than by Epaminondas who died without offspring? And did Priam, who begot fifty sons, all rascals, or Danaus, or Aeolus, contribute more to the common weal than did Homer? What? Shall high military command or writing a book prevent a man from marrying and having children, while such a person will not be regarded as having exchanged his childlessness for naught, and yet shall the Cynic’s kingship not be thought a reasonable compensation? Can it be that we do not perceive the greatness of Diogenes, and have no adequate conception of his character, but have in mind the present-day representatives of the profession, these “dogs of the table, guards of the gate,”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] who follow the masters not at all, except it be in breaking wind in public, forsooth, but in nothing else? Otherwise such points as these you have been raising would never have disturbed us, we should never have wondered why a Cynic will never marry or have children. Man, the Cynic has made all mankind his children; the men among them he has as sons, the women as daughters; in that spirit he approaches them all and cares for them all. Or do you fancy that it is in the spirit of idle impertinence he reviles those he meets? It is as a father he does it, as a brother, and as a servant of Zeus, who is Father of us all.

	politics. You ninny, are you looking for any nobler politics than that in which he is engaged? Or would you have someone in Athens step forward and discourse about incomes and revenues, when he is the person who ought to talk with all men, Athenians, Corinthians, and Romans alike, not about revenues, or income, or peace, or war, but about happiness and unhappiness, about success and failure, about slavery and freedom? When a man is engaging in such exalted politics, do [c dimgray]you[/c] ask me if he is to engage in politics? Ask me also, if he will hold office. Again I will tell you: Fool, what nobler office will he hold than that which he now has?

	And yet such a man needs also a certain kind of body, since if a consumptive comes forward, thin and pale,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] his testimony no longer carries the same weight. For he must not merely, by exhibiting the qualities of his soul, prove to the laymen that it is possible, without the help of the things which they admire, to be a good and excellent man, but he must also show, by the state of his body, that his plain and simple style of life in the open air does not injure even his body: “Look,” he says, “both I and my body are witnesses to the truth of my contention.” That was the way of Diogenes, for he used to go about with a radiant complexion,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and would attract the attention of the common people by the very appearance of his body. But a Cynic who excites pity is regarded as a beggar;

	everybody turns away from him, everybody takes offence at him. No, and he ought not to look dirty either, so as not to scare men away in this respect also; but even his squalor ought to be cleanly and attractive.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, the Cynic ought to possess great natural charm and readiness of wit—otherwise he becomes mere snivel, and nothing else—so as to be able to meet readily and aptly whatever befalls; as Diogenes answered the man who said: “Are you the Diogenes who does not believe in the existence of the gods?” by saying, “And how can that be? You I regard as hated by the gods!”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Or again, when Alexander[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] stood over him as he was sleeping and said,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Sleeping the whole night through beseems not

	But above all, the Cynic’s governing principle should be purer than the sun; if not, he must needs be a gambler and a man of no principle, because he will be censuring the rest of mankind, while he himself is involved in some vice. For see what this means. To the kings and tyrants of this world their bodyguards and their arms used to

	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Homer, [c dimgray]Iliad[/c], II. 24 and 25. The only point in the anecdote seems to be that Diogenes could say something more or less apposite even when only half awake; for the completion of the quotation is in no sense a real answer to the reproach.

	afford[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] the privilege of censuring certain persons, and the power also to punish those who do wrong, no matter how guilty they themselves were; whereas to the Cynic it is his conscience which affords him this power, and not his arms and his bodyguards. When he sees that he has watched over men, and toiled in their behalf; and that he has slept in purity, while his sleep leaves him even purer than he was before; and that every thought which he thinks is that of a friend and servant to the gods, of one who shares in the government of Zeus; and has always ready at hand the verse

	Lead thou me on, O Zeus, and Destiny,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	That is why the man who is in this frame of mind is neither a busybody nor a meddler; for he is not meddling in other people’s affairs when he is overseeing the actions of men, but these are his proper concern. Otherwise, go call the general a meddler when he oversees and reviews and watches over his troops, and punishes those who are guilty of a breach of discipline. But if you censure other men while you are hiding a little sweet-cake under your arm, I’ll say to you: Wouldn’t you rather go off into a corner and eat up what you have stolen? What have you to do with other people’s business?

	Why who are you? Are you the bull in the herd, or the queen bee of the hive? Show me the tokens of your leadership, like those which nature gives the queen bee. But if you are a drone and lay claim to the sovereignty over the bees, don’t you suppose your fellow-citizens will overthrow you, just as the bees so treat the drones?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now the spirit of patient endurance the Cynic must have to such a degree that common people will think him insensate and a stone; nobody reviles[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] him, nobody beats him, nobody insults him; but his body he has himself given for anyone to use as he sees fit. For he bears in mind that the inferior, in that respect in which it is inferior, must needs be overcome by the superior, and that his body is inferior to the crowd—the physically weaker, that is, inferior to the physically stronger. Therefore, he never enters this contest where he can be beaten, but immediately gives up what is not his own; he makes no claim to what is slavish.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] But in the realm of the moral purpose, and the use of his sense-impressions, there you will see he has so many eyes that you will say Argus was blind in comparison with him. Is there anywhere rash assent, reckless choice, futile desire, unsuccessful aversion, incompleted purpose, fault-finding, self-disparagement, or envy? Here is concentrated his earnest attention and energy; but, as far as other things go, he lies flat on his back and snores; he is in perfect peace. There rises up no thief of his moral purpose, nor any tyrant over it. But of his body? Certainly. And of his paltry possessions?

	Certainly; and of his offices and honours. Why, then, does he pay any attention to these? So when anyone tries to terrify him by means of these things, he says to him, “Go to, look for children; [c dimgray]they[/c] are scared by masks; but I know that they are made of earthenware, and have nothing inside.”

	Such is the nature of the matter about which you are deliberating. Wherefore, in the name of God I adjure you, put off your decision, and look first at your endowment. For see what Hector says to Andromache. “Go,” says he, “rather into the house and weave;

	but for men shall war be the business,

	Tell yourself, first of all, what kind of man you want to be; and then go ahead with what you are doing. For in practically every other pursuit we see this done. The athletes first decide what kind of athletes they want to be, and then they act accordingly. If a man wants to be a distance-runner,
	he adopts a suitable diet, walking, rubbing, and exercise; if he wants to be a sprinter, all these details are different; if he wants to contend in the pentathlon, they are still more different

	You will find the same thing in the arts. If you want to be a carpenter, you will have such and such exercises; if a blacksmith, such and such other. For in everything that we do, if we do not refer it to some standard, we shall be acting at random; but if we refer it to the wrong standard, we shall make an utter failure. Furthermore, there are two standards to go by, the one general, the other individual. First of all, I must act as a man. What is included in this? Not to act as a sheep, gently but without fixed purpose; nor destructively, like a wild beast. The individual standard applies to each man’s occupation and moral purpose. The citharoede is to act as a citharoede,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] the carpenter as a carpenter, the philosopher as a philosopher, the rhetor as a rhetor. When, therefore, you say, “Come and listen to me as I read you a lecture,” see to it first that you are not acting without fixed purpose. And then, if you find that you [c dimgray]are[/c] using a standard of judgement, see if it is the right one. Do you wish to do good or to be praised? you ask. Immediately you get the answer, “What do I care for praise from the mob?” And that is an excellent answer. Neither does the musician, in so far as he is a musician, nor the geometrician. Do you wish to do good, then? To what end? men reply. Tell us, also, that we too may run to your lecture-room. Now can anybody do good to others unless he has received good himself? No more than the non-carpenter
	can help others in carpentry, or the non-cobbler in cobbling.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Do you wish, then, to know whether you have received any good? Produce your judgements, philosopher. What does desire promise? Not to

	fail in getting. What does aversion? Not to fall into what we are avoiding. Well, do we fulfil their promise? Tell me the truth; but if you lie, I will say to you: “The other day, when your audience gathered rather coolly, and did not shout applause, you walked out of the hall in low spirits. And again the other day, when you were received with applause, you walked around and asked everybody, ‘What did you think of me?’ ‘It was marvellous, sir, I swear by my life.’ ‘How did I render that particular passage?’ ‘Which one?’ ‘Where I drew a picture of Pan and the Nymphs?’ ‘It was superb.’ ” And after all this you tell me that you follow nature in desire and aversion? Go to; try to get somebody else to believe you! Didn’t you, just the other day, praise So-and-so contrary to your honest opinion? And didn’t you flatter So-and-so, the senator? Did you want your children to be like that?—Far from it!—Why then did you praise him and palaver over him?—He is a gifted young man and fond of listening to discourses.—How do you know that?—He is an admirer of mine.—There you gave your proof!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After all, what do you think? Don’t these very same persons secretly despise you? When, therefore, a person who is conscious of never having either thought or done a good thing finds a philosopher who tells him, “You are a genius, straightforward and unspoiled,” what else do you suppose the man says to himself but, “This man wants to use me for something or other”? Or else tell me; what work of genius has he displayed? Look, he has been with you all this time, he has listened to your discourse, he has heard you lecture.

	Has he settled down? Has he come to himself? Has he realized the evil plight in which he is? Has he cast aside his self-conceit? Is he looking for the man who will teach him?—He is looking, the man says.—The man who will teach him how he ought to live? No, fool, but only how he ought to deliver a speech; for that is why he admires even you. Listen to him, and hear what he says. “This fellow has a most artistic style; it is much finer than Dio’s.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] That’s altogether different. He doesn’t say, does he, “The man is respectful, he is faithful and unperturbed”? And even if he had said this, I would have replied: “Since this man is faithful, what is your definition of the faithful man?” And if he had no answer to give, I would have added: “First find out what you are talking about, and then do your talking.”

	When you are in such a sorry state as this, then, gaping for men to praise you, and counting the number of your audience, is it your wish to do good to others? “To-day I had a much larger audience.” “Yes, indeed, there were great numbers.” “Five hundred, I fancy.” “Nonsense, make it a thousand.” “Dio never had so large an audience.” “How could you expect him to?” “Yes, and they are clever at catching the points.” “Beauty, sir, can move even a stone.”[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] There are the words of a philosopher for you!

	The idea behind it would be familiar from the story of how
	the trees followed Orpheus, in order to hear his beautiful
	music, or the stones arranged themselves in the walls of
	Thebes, to the strains of Amphion. Capps, however, thinks that “τὸ καλόν means ‘honour’ ” here, and that the remark is “cynical.” He would translate: “Talk of honour, sir,” etc., adding the explanatory note: “That is, the speaker would have had no success with his audience if he had preached honour and virtue (as the true philosopher should).”

	a man who has listened to reason, who has read the accounts of Socrates as coming from Socrates, not as though they were from Lysias, or Isocrates! “ ‘I have often wondered by what arguments ever’—no, but ‘by what argument ever’—this form is smoother than the other!”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] You have been reading this literature just as you would music-hall songs, haven’t you? Because, if you had read them in the right way, you would not have lingered on these points, but this is the sort of thing rather that would have caught your eye: “Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot hurt me”;[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and: “I have always been the kind of man to pay attention to none of my own affairs, but only to the argument which strikes me as best upon reflection.”[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] And for that reason who ever heard Socrates saying, “I know something and teach it”? But he used to send one person here and another there.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] Therefore men used to go to him to have him introduce them to philosophers,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] and he used to take them around and introduce them. But no, [c dimgray]your[/c] idea of him, no doubt, is that, as he was taking them along, he used to say, “Come around to-day and hear me deliver a discourse in the house of Quadratus”![c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]

	What do you mean by “praise”? “Cry out to me, ‘Bravo!’ or ‘Marvellous!’ ” All right, I’ll say it. But if praise is some one of those things which the philosophers put in the category of the good, what praise can I give you? If it is a good thing to speak correctly, teach me and I will praise you. What then? Ought one to take no pleasure in listening to such efforts? Far from it. I do not fail to take pleasure in listening to a citharoede; surely I am not bound for that reason to stand and sing to my own accompaniment on the harp, am I? Listen, what does Socrates say? “Nor would it be seemly for me, O men of Athens, at my time of life to appear before you like some lad, and weave a cunning discourse.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] “Like some lad,” he says. For it is indeed a dainty thing, this small art of selecting trivial phrases and putting them together, and of coming forward and reading or reciting them gracefully, and then in the midst of the delivery shouting out, “There are not many people who can follow this, by your lives, I swear it!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Does a philosopher invite people to a lecture?—Is it not rather the case that, as the sun draws its own sustenance to itself,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] so he also draws to himself those to whom he is to do good? What physician ever invites a patient to come and be healed by him? Although I am told that in these days the physicians in Rome [c dimgray]do[/c] advertise; however, in my time they were called in[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] by their patients. “I invite you to

	come and hear that you are in a bad way, and that you are concerned with anything rather than what you should be concerned with, and that you are ignorant of the good and the evil, and are wretched and miserable.” That’s a fine invitation! And yet if the philosopher’s discourse does not produce this effect, it is lifeless and so is the speaker himself. Rufus used to say, “If you have nothing better to do than to praise me, then I am speaking to no purpose.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Wherefore he spoke in such a way that each of us as we sat there fancied someone had gone to Rufus and told him of our faults; so effective was his grasp of what men actually do, so vividly did he set before each man’s eyes his particular weaknesses.

	Men, the lecture-room of the philosopher is a hospital;[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] you ought not to walk out of it in pleasure, but in pain. For you are not well when you come; one man has a dislocated shoulder, another an abscess, another a fistula, another a headache. And then am I to sit down and recite to you dainty little notions and clever little mottoes, so that you will go out with words of praise on your lips, one man carrying away his shoulder just as it was when he came in, another his head in the same state, another his fistula, another his abscess? And so it’s for this, is it, that young men are to travel from home, and leave their parents, their friends, their relatives, and their bit of property, merely to cry
	“Bravo!” as you recite your clever little mottoes? Was this what Socrates used to do, or Zeno, or Cleanthes?

	Well! But isn’t there such a thing as the right style for exhortation?—Why yes, who denies that? Just as there is the style for refutation, and the style for instruction. Who, then, has ever mentioned a fourth style along with these, the style of display?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Why, what is the style for exhortation? The ability to show to the individual, as well as to the crowd, the warring inconsistency in which they are floundering about, and how they are paying attention to anything rather than what they truly want. For they want the things that conduce to happiness, but they are looking for them in the wrong place. To achieve that must a thousand benches be placed, and the prospective audience be invited, and you put on a fancy cloak, or dainty mantle, and mount the speaker’s stand, and paint a word-picture of—how Achilles died? By the gods, I beseech you, have done with discrediting, as far as it is in your power to discredit, words and actions that are noble! There is nothing more effective in the style for exhortation than when the speaker makes clear to his audience that he has need of them.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Or tell me, who that ever heard you reading a lecture or conducting a discourse felt greatly disturbed about himself, or came to a realization of the state he was in, or on going out said, “The philosopher brought it home to me in fine style; I must not act like this any longer”? But doesn’t he say to a companion, if you make an unusually fine impression, “That was beautiful diction in the passage about Xerxes”; and doesn’t the other answer, “No, I preferred the one about the battle of Thermopylae”?[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Is this what listening to a philosopher amounts to?

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]That is, as a style appropriate to philosophers, for the
	epideictic, or style of display, was a well-recognized branch
	of oratory in general—and not entirely unknown, perhaps,
	among certain popular preachers even to-day.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]As God needs the universe in which to exercise and display
	His power, so the teacher needs pupils, the speaker an
	audience. There is a mutual need, therefore, each of the
	other.

	[b][c dimgray]That we ought not to yearn for the things which are not under our control[/c][/b]
	Let not that which in the case of another is contrary to nature become an evil for you; for you are born not to be humiliated along with others, nor to share in their misfortunes, but to share in their good fortune. If, however, someone is unfortunate, remember that his misfortune concerns himself.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] For God made all mankind to be happy, to be serene. To this end He gave them resources, giving each man some things for his own, and others not for his own. The things that are subject to hindrance, deprivation, and compulsion are not a man’s own, but those which cannot be hindered are his own. The true nature of the good and the evil, as was fitting for Him who watches over and protects us like a father, He gave to man to be among his own possessions.
	“But I have parted from So-and-so, and he is stricken with grief.” Yes, but why did he regard what was not his own as his own? Why, when he was glad to see you, did he not reflect that you are mortal, and likely to go on a journey? And therefore he is paying the penalty for his own folly. But why are [c dimgray]you[/c] bewailing yourself, and to what end? Or did you also neglect to study this matter, but, like worthless women, did you enjoy everything in which you took delight as though you were to enjoy it for ever, your surroundings, human beings, your ways of life? And now you sit and wail because you no longer lay eyes upon the same persons, and do not spend your life in the same places. Yes, for that’s what you

Further, that all things are full of friends, first gods, and then also men, who by nature have been made of one household with one another; and that some men must remain with each other, while others must depart, and that though we must rejoice in those who dwell with us, yet we must not grieve at those who depart.

Yet how many friends do you suppose he had in Thebes, in Argos, in Athens, and how many new friends he made on his rounds, seeing that he was even in the habit of marrying when he saw fit, and begetting children, and deserting his children, without either groaning or yearning for them, or as though leaving them to be orphans?[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] It was because he knew that no human being is an orphan, but all men have ever and constantly the Father, who cares for them. Why, to him it was no mere story which he had heard, that Zeus is father of men, for he always thought of Him as his own father, and called Him so, and in all that he did he looked to Him. Wherefore he had the power to live happily in every place. But it is impossible that happiness, and yearning for what is not present, should ever be united. For happiness

	must already possess everything that it wants; it must resemble a replete person: he cannot feel thirst or hunger.—Still, Odysseus felt a longing for his wife, and sat upon a rock and wept.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]—And do you take Homer and his tales as authority for everything? If Odysseus really wept, what else could he have been but miserable? But what good and excellent man is miserable? In all truth the universe is badly managed, if Zeus does not take care of His own citizens, that they be like Him, that is, happy. Nay, it is unlawful and unholy to think of such an alternative, but if Odysseus wept and wailed, he was not a good man. Why, what man could be good who does not know who he is? And who knows that, if he has forgotten that the things which come into being are corruptible, and that it is impossible for one human being always to live with another? What then? To reach out for the impossible is slavish and foolish; it is acting like a stranger in the universe, one who is fighting against God with the only weapons at his command, his own judgements.

	But my mother mourns because she does not see me.—Yes, but why did she not learn the meaning of these words of the philosophers? And I am not saying that you ought to take no pains to keep her from lamenting, but only that a person ought not to want at all costs what is not his own. Now another’s grief is no concern of mine, but my own grief is. Therefore, I will put an end at all costs to what is my own concern, for [c dimgray]it[/c] is under my control: and that which is another’s concern I will endeavour to check to the best of my ability, but my effort to do so will not be made at all costs.

	God, I shall be setting myself in opposition to Zeus, I shall be arraying myself against Him in regard to His administration of the universe. And the wages of this fighting against God and this disobedience will not be paid by “children’s children,”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] but by me myself in my own person, by day and by night, as I start up out of dreams and am disturbed, trembling at every message, with my own peace of mind depending upon letters not my own. Someone has arrived from Rome, “If only there is no bad news!” But how can anything bad for [c dimgray]you[/c] happen in a place, if you are not there? Someone arrives from Greece. “If only there is no bad news!” In this way for [c dimgray]you[/c] every place can cause misfortune. Isn’t it enough for you to be miserable where you are? Must you needs be miserable even beyond the seas, and by letter? Is this the fashion in which all that concerns you is secure?—Yes,
	but what if my friends over there die?—Why, what else than that mortal men died? Or how can you wish to reach old age yourself, and at the same time not behold the death of any that you love? Do you not know that in the long course of time many different things must needs happen; fever must overcome one man, a brigand another, a tyrant a third? Because such is the character of the air about us, such that of our associates; cold and heat and unsuitable food, and journeys by land and by sea, and winds and all manner of perils; this man they destroy, that man they drive into exile, another they send on an embassy, and yet another on a campaign.

	Is that what you used to hear when you sat at the feet of the philosophers? Is that what you learned? Do you not know that the business of life is a campaign? One man must mount guard, another go out on reconnaissance, and another out to fight. It is not possible for all to stay in the same place, nor is it better so. But you neglect to perform the duties assigned you by your commanding officer, and complain when some rather hard order is given you, and fail to understand to what a state you are bringing the army, as far as in you lies; because, if they all imitate you, no one will dig a trench, no one construct a palisade, or watch through the night, or risk his life in fighting, but they will seem useless soldiers. Again, if you take ship as a sailor, take up one place and stick to that! and if you have to climb the mast, be unwilling; if you have to run to the bow, be unwilling! And what ship’s captain will put up with you? Won’t he throw you overboard like a piece of junk, nothing but a nuisance, and a bad example to the other sailors? So also in this world; each man’s life is a kind of campaign, and a long and complicated one at that. You have to maintain the character of a soldier, and do each separate act at the bidding of the General, if possible divining what He wishes. For there is no comparison between this General and an ordinary one, either in His power, or in the pre-eminence of His character. You have been given a post in an imperial city, and not in some mean place; not for a

Well, but those who falsely claim Roman citizenship are severely punished, and ought those who falsely claim so great and so dignified a calling and title to get off scot-free? Or is that impossible? whereas the divine and mighty and inescapable law is the law which exacts the greatest penalties from those who are guilty of the greatest offences. Now what are its terms? “Let him who makes pretence to things which in no wise concern him be a braggart, let him be a vainglorious man; let him who disobeys the divine governance be abject, be a slave, suffer grief, envy, pity,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]—in a word, be miserable, and lament.”

Why, you are not ashamed to go to the door of the cobbler when you need shoes, nor to that of the market-gardener when you need lettuce; and are you ashamed to go to the door of the rich when you want something that rich men have?—Very true, for as to the cobbler, I do not have to admire him.—Don’t admire the rich man, either.—And I shall not have to flatter the market-gardener.—Don’t
	flatter the rich man either.—How, then, shall I get what I need?—Am I telling you, “Go like a man who is certain to get what he wants,” and not simply, “Go in order to do what becomes you”?—Why,

	you are, of a brother, of a friend. And furthermore, remember that you have come to see a cobbler, a vegetable-dealer, a man who has authority over nothing great or important, even if he sell it for a high price. You are going, as it were, for heads of lettuce; they are worth an obol, not a talent. So it is in our life also. The matter in hand is worth going to a person’s door about; very well, I will go. It is also worth an interview; very well, I will interview him about it. Yes, but I will have to kiss his hand also, and flatter him with words of praise. Go to! that is paying a talent for a head of lettuce! It is not profitable to me, nor to the State, nor to my friends, to ruin by so acting a good citizen and friend.

	Yes, but if you fail, people will think that you didn’t try hard. Have you gone and forgotten again why you went? Don’t you know that a good and excellent man does nothing for the sake of appearances, but only for the sake of having acted right?—What good does he get, then, from acting right?—And what good does the person get for writing the name “Dio” as it ought to be written? The mere fact of writing it that way.—Is there, then, no further reward?—And are you looking for some further reward in the case of a good man, a reward which is greater than the doing of what is fine and right? At Olympia nobody wants anything else, but you feel content with having received an Olympic crown. Does it seem to you so small and worthless a thing to be good, and excellent, and happy? Therefore, when you have been introduced into this city-state[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] by the gods, and find it now your duty to lay hand to the work of a man, do you

	In Athens did you see nobody when you went to his house?—Yes, the man I wanted to see.—Here also make up your mind to see this man, and you will see the man you want; only do not go humbly, not with desire or aversion, and all will be well with you. But this result is not to be found by mere going, nor by standing at gates, but in one’s judgements within. When you have contemned things external and outside the province of your moral purpose, and have come to regard none of them as your own, but only the being right in judgement, in thinking, in choosing, in desiring, in avoiding,—where is there any longer room for flattery, where for an abject spirit? Why any longer yearn for the quiet you enjoyed there, or your familiar haunts? Wait a little while and you will find the places here familiar in their turn. And then, if you are so ignoble in spirit, weep and wail again when you leave these too!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	How, then, shall I become affectionate?—As a man of noble spirit, as one who is fortunate; for it is against all reason to be abject, or broken in spirit, or to depend on something other than yourself, or even to blame either God or man. I would have you become affectionate in such a way as to maintain at the same time all these rules; if, however, by virtue of this natural affection, whatever it is you call by that name, you are going to be a

	slave and miserable, it does not profit you to be affectionate. And what keeps you from loving a person as one subject to death, as one who may leave you? Did not Socrates love his own children? But in a free spirit, as one who remembers that it was his first duty to be a friend to the gods. That is why he succeeded in everything that becomes a good man, both in making his defence, and in assessing his own penalty, and before that time in his services as senator or soldier. But [c dimgray]we[/c] abound in all manner of excuses for being ignoble; with some it is a child, with others a mother, and then again it is brothers. But it is not becoming for us to be unhappy on any person’s account, but to be happy because of all, and above all others because of God, who has made us for this end. Come, was there anybody that Diogenes did not love, a man who was so gentle and kind-hearted that he gladly took upon himself all those troubles and physical hardships for the sake of the common weal? But what was the manner of his loving? As became a servant of Zeus, caring for men indeed, but at the same time subject unto God. That is why for him alone the whole world, and no special place, was his fatherland; and when he had been taken prisoner he did not hanker for Athens nor his acquaintances and friends there, but he got on good terms with the pirates and tried[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] to reform them. And later, when he was sold into slavery at Corinth he kept on living there just as he had formerly lived at Athens; yes, and if he had gone off to the Perrhaebians he would have acted in quite the same way. That is how

	freedom is achieved. That is why he used to say, “From the time that Antisthenes[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] set me free, I have ceased to be a slave.” How did Antisthenes set him free? Listen to what Diogenes says. “He taught me what was mine, and what was not mine. Property is not mine; kinsmen, members of my household, friends, reputation, familiar places, converse with men—all these are not my own. ‘What, then, [c dimgray]is[/c] yours? Power to deal with external impressions.’ He showed me that I possess this beyond all hindrance and constraint; no one can hamper me; no one can force me to deal with them otherwise than as I will. Who, then, has authority over me? Philip, or Alexander, or Perdiccas, or the Great King?[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Where can they get it? For the man who is destined to be overpowered by a man must long before that have been overpowered by things.” Therefore, the man over whom pleasure has no power, nor evil, nor fame, nor wealth, and who, whenever it seems good to him, can spit his whole paltry body into some oppressor’s face[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and depart from this life—whose slave can he any longer be, whose subject? But if he had gone on living pleasantly in Athens, and had been enamoured of his life there, his fortune would have been in every man’s control, and the man who was stronger than he would have had power to cause him grief. How do you imagine he would have wheedled the pirates to sell him to some Athenian, so that he might some time see the beautiful Piraeus, and the Long Walls and the Acropolis! Who are you that you should see them, slave? A thrall and a person of abject spirit; and what good are they to you?—No, not a slave, but a free man.—Show me how you are free.

	See, some person or other has laid hands on you—the
	man who takes you away from your accustomed way of life, and says, “You are my slave; for it is in my power to prevent you from living as you will, it is in my power to lighten your servitude, or to humble you; whenever I wish, you can be happy again, and go off to Athens in high spirits.” What do you say to this man who makes you his slave? Whom have you to offer him as your emancipator? Or do you not even look him in the face at all, but cutting all argument short do you implore him to set you free? Man, you ought to go gladly to prison, in haste, outstripping those who lead you away. And then, I do beseech you, are you loath to live in Rome, and do you yearn for Greece? And when you have to die, then also, I suppose, will you weep all over us, because you are never going to see Athens again or stroll in the Lyceum?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Was that what you went abroad for? Was it for this that you sought to meet someone—that he might do you good? Good indeed! That you might analyse syllogisms more readily, or run down hypothetical arguments? It was for [c dimgray]this[/c] reason, was it, you left brother, country, friends, and those of your own household—so as to return with [c dimgray]this[/c] kind of learning? And so you did not go abroad to acquire constancy of character, or peace of mind; not to become secure yourself and thenceforward blame and find fault with no man; not to make it impossible for another to do you wrong, and so maintain without hindrance your relations in society? A fine exchange of goods this which you have achieved, syllogisms, and arguments with equivocal and hypothetical premisses!

	Yes, and if you see fit, seat yourself in the marketplace, and hang out a sign, as the drug-peddlers do. Ought you not rather to deny that you know even all you have learned, so as not to bring your philosophical precepts into ill repute as being useless? What harm has philosophy done you? How has Chrysippus wronged you that you should prove by your own conduct his labours to be useless? Were not the ills at home enough for you, all that you had to cause you grief and sorrow, even if you had not gone abroad, but did you add yet others in addition to them? And if you get other intimates and friends again, you will have more reasons for lamentation, yes, and if you get attached to another land. Why, then, live? Is it to involve yourself in one grief after another that makes you miserable? And then, I ask you, do you call this natural affection? Natural affection forsooth, man! If it is good, it is the source of no evil; if it is evil, I have nothing to do with it. I am born for the things that are good and belong to me, not for things evil.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, is the proper discipline for this? In the first place, the highest and principal discipline, and one that stands at the very gates of the subject, is this: Whenever you grow attached to something, do not act as though it were one of those things that cannot be taken away, but as though it were something like a jar or a crystal goblet, so that when it breaks you will remember what it was like, and not be troubled. So too in life; if you kiss your child, your brother, your friend, never allow your fancy free rein, nor your exuberant spirits to go as far as they like, but hold them back, stop them, just like those who

	stand behind generals when they ride in triumph, and keep reminding them that they are mortal.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] In such fashion do you too remind yourself that the object of your love is mortal; it is not one of your own possessions; it has been given you for the present, not inseparably nor for ever, but like a fig, or a cluster of grapes, at a fixed season of the year, and that if you hanker for it in the winter, you are a fool. If in this way you long for your son, or your friend, at a time when he is not given to you, rest assured that you are hankering for a fig in wintertime. For as winter-time is to a fig, so is every state of affairs, which arises out of the universe, in relation to the things which are destroyed in accordance with that same state of affairs.

	Furthermore, at the very moment when you are taking delight in something, call to mind the opposite impressions. What harm is there if you whisper to yourself, at the very moment you are kissing your child, and say, “To-morrow you will die”? So likewise to your friend, “To-morrow you will go abroad, or I shall, and we shall never see each other again”?—Nay, but these are words of bad omen.—Yes, and so are certain incantations, but because they do good, I do not care about that, only let the incantation do us good. But do you call any things ill-omened except those which signify some evil for us? Cowardice is ill-omened, a mean spirit, grief, sorrow, shamelessness; these are words of ill-omen. And yet we ought not to hesitate to utter even these words, in order to guard

	against the things themselves. Do you tell me that any word is ill-omened which signifies some process of nature? Say that also the harvesting of ears of grain is ill-omened, for it signifies the destruction of the ears; but not of the universe. Say that also for leaves to fall is ill-omened, and for the fresh fig to turn into a dried fig, and a cluster of grapes to turn into raisins. For all these things are changes of a preliminary state into something else; it is not a case of destruction, but a certain ordered dispensation and management. This is what going abroad means, a slight change; this is the meaning of death, a greater change of that which now is, not into what is not, but into what is not [c dimgray]now[/c].—Shall I, then, be no more?—No, you will not be, but something else will be, something different from that of which the universe now has need.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And this is but reasonable, for you came into being, not when [c dimgray]you[/c] wanted, but when the universe had need of you.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For this reason the good and excellent man, bearing in mind who he is, and whence he has come, and by whom he was created, centres his attention on this and this only, how he may fill his place in an orderly fashion, and with due obedience to God. “Is it Thy will that I should still remain? I will remain as a free man, as a noble man, as Thou didst wish it; for Thou hast made me free from hindrance in what was mine own. And now hast Thou no further need of me? Be it well with Thee. I have been waiting here until now because of Thee and of none other, and now I obey Thee and depart.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]This seems to me to be the most probable meaning of a
	vexed passage. If any change is needed, which I doubt
	(for ἄλλος with the simple genitive is abundantly attested,
	at least in other authors), I should prefer to read ἄλλο τι ἢ οὗ, rather than to change οὐκ into οὐ, delete or transpose it, or take νῦν in the sense of τότε.

But so long as I continue to live in Thy service, what manner of man wouldst Thou have me be? An official or a private citizen, a senator or one of the common people, a soldier or a general, a teacher or the head of a household? Whatsoever station and post Thou assign me, I will die ten thousand times, as Socrates says, or ever I abandon it.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And where wouldst Thou have me be? In Rome, or in Athens, or in Thebes, or in Gyara?[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Only remember me there. If Thou sendest me to a place where men have no means of living in accordance with nature, 1 shall depart this life, not in disobedience to Thee, but as though Thou wert sounding for me the recall. I do not abandon Thee—far be that from me! but I perceive that Thou hast no need of me. Yet if there be vouchsafed a means of living in accordance with nature, I will seek no other place than that in which I am, or other men than those who are now my associates.”

	Have thoughts like these ready at hand by night and by day; write them, read them, make your conversation about them, communing with yourself, or saying to another, “Can you give me some help in this matter?” And again, go now to one man and now to another. Then, if some one of those things happens which are called undesirable, immediately the thought that it was not unexpected will be the first thing to lighten the burden. For in every case it is a great help to be able to say, “I knew that the son whom I had begotten was

If you are at Gyara, don’t picture the style of life at Rome, and all the relaxations a man had who was living there, as well as all that he might have upon his return; but since you have been stationed there, you ought to strive to live manfully at Gyara, as beseems the man whose life is spent in Gyara. And again, if you are in Rome, don’t picture the style of life at Athens, but make your life in Rome the one object of your study and practice.

	Then, in the place of all the other relaxations, introduce that which comes from the consciousness that you are obedient to God, and that you are playing the part of the good and excellent man, not ostensibly but in reality. For what a fine thing it

	is to be able to say to oneself, “Now I am actually performing what the rest talk solemnly about in their lectures, and are thought to be uttering paradoxes. Yes, they sit and expound my virtues, and study about me, and sing my praise. And of this Zeus wished me to get a demonstration in my own person, while at the same time He wished to know whether He has the right kind of soldier, the right kind of citizen, and to present me before all other men as a witness about the things which lie outside the sphere of the moral purpose. ‘Behold,’ says He, ‘your fears are at haphazard, it is in vain that you desire what you desire. Do not look for your blessings outside, but look for them within yourselves; otherwise you will not find them.’ These are the terms upon which now He brings me here, and again He sends me there; to mankind exhibits me in poverty, without office, in sickness; sends me away to Gyara, brings me into prison. Not because He hates me—perish the thought! And who hates the best of his servants? Nor because He neglects me, for He does not neglect any of even the least of His creatures; but because He is training me, and making use of me as a witness to the rest of men. When I have been appointed to such a service, am I any longer to take thought as to where I am, or with whom, or what men say about me? Am I not wholly intent upon God, and His commands and ordinances?”

	If you have these thoughts always at hand and go over them again and again in your own mind, and keep them in readiness, you will never need a person to console you, or strengthen you. For disgrace does not consist in not having anything to

	Consider which of the things that you purposed at the start you have achieved, and which you have not; likewise, how it gives you pleasure to recall some of them, and pain to recall others, and, if possible, recover also those things which have slipped out of your grasp. For men who are engaged in the greatest of contests ought not to flinch, but to take also the blows; for the contest before us is not in wrestling or the pancratium, in which, whether a man succeeds or fails, he may be worth a great deal, or only a little,—yes, by Zeus, he may even be extremely happy or extremely miserable,—but it is a contest for good fortune and happiness itself.

	the time being, no one prevents us from struggling again, and we do not have to wait another four-year period for another Olympic festival to come around, but the moment a man has picked himself up, and recovered himself, and exhibits the same eagerness, he is allowed to contest; and if you give in again, you can enter again; and if once you win a victory, you are as though you had never given in at all. Only don’t begin cheerfully to do the same thing
	over again out of sheer habit, and end up as a bad athlete, going the whole circuit of the games, and getting beaten all the time, like quails that have once run away.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] “I am overcome by the impression of a pretty maid. Well, what of it? Wasn’t I overcome just the other day?” “I feel strongly inclined to censure somebody, for didn’t I censure somebody just the other day?” You talk thus to us as though you had come off scot-free; just as if a man should say to his physician who was forbidding him to bathe, “Why, but didn’t I bathe just the other day?” If, then, the physician is able to say to him, “Very well, after you had bathed, then, how did you feel? Didn’t you have a fever? Didn’t your head ache?” So, too, when you censured somebody the other day, didn’t you act like an ugly-spirited man, like a silly babbler? Didn’t you feed this habit by citing the example of your own previous acts? And when you were overcome by the maid, did you escape scot-free? Why, then, do you talk about what you were doing just the other day? In my opinion, you ought to have remembered, as slaves remember their blows, and to have kept away from the same mistakes.

Wretch, are you so blind, and do you so fail to see the road to which lack of the necessities of life leads? Where, indeed, does it lead? Where also fever, or a stone that drops on your head, lead,—to death. Have you not, then, often said this same thing yourself to your companions, read much of the same sort, and written much? How many times have you boasted that, as far as death at least was concerned, you are in a fairly good state?—Yes, but my family too will starve.—What then?

	wealthiest needs must go, and those who have held the highest offices, and very kings and tyrants? Only you will descend hungry, if it so happen, and they bursting with indigestion and drunkenness. Did you ever easily find a beggar who was not an old man? Wasn’t he extremely old? But though they are cold night and day, and lie forlorn on the ground, and have to eat only what is absolutely necessary, they approach a state where it is almost impossible for them to die;[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] yet you who are physically perfect, and have hands and feet, are you so alarmed about starving? Can’t you draw water, or write, or escort boys to and from school, or be another’s doorkeeper?—But it is disgraceful to come to such a necessity.—Learn, therefore, first of all, what the disgraceful things are, and after you have done that, come into our presence and call yourself a philosopher. But as the case stands now, do not even allow anyone else to call you one!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Is anything disgraceful to you which is not your own doing, for which you are not responsible, which has befallen you accidentally, as a headache or a fever? If your parents were poor, or if they were rich but left others as their heirs, and if they give you no help though they are living, is all this disgraceful to you? Is that what you learned at the feet of the philosophers? Have you never heard that the disgraceful thing is censurable, and the censurable is that which deserves censure? And whom do you censure for what is not his own doing, which he didn’t produce himself? Well, did you produce this situation? did you make your father

	what he is? Or is it in your power to reform him? Is that vouchsafed you? What follows? Ought you to wish for what is not given you, or to be ashamed when you fail to get it? And did you really, while studying philosophy, acquire the habit of looking to other persons, and of hoping for nothing yourself from yourself? Very well then, lament and groan, and eat in fear of not having food to-morrow; tremble about your paltry slaves, for fear they will steal something, or run away, or die! Live in this spirit and never cease to live so, you who in name only have approached philosophy, and, as far as in you lay, have discredited its principles by showing them to be useless and good for nothing to those who receive them! But you never desired stability, serenity, peace of mind; you never cultivated anybody’s acquaintance for that purpose, but many persons’ acquaintance for the sake of syllogisms; you never thoroughly tested for yourself any one of these external impressions, asking the questions: “Am I able to bear it, or am I not? What may I expect next?” but just as though everything about you were in an excellent and safe condition, you have been devoting your attention to the last of all topics, that which deals with immutability, in order that you may have immutable—what? your cowardice, your ignoble character, your admiration of the rich, your ineffectual desire, your aversion that fails of its mark![c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] These are the things about whose security you have been anxious!

	technical terms in ἀποτευκτικὴ ἔκκλισις is incredible. Elsewhere,
	and quite properly, it is desire that fails to get what
	it wills (ἀποτευκτική), and aversion that falls into what it
	would avoid (see III. 6, 6 and especially IV. 10, 4). Hence
	there is great plausibility in Schenkl’s suggestion (partly after Reiske), ὄρεξιν, τὴν ἀποτευκτικήν, <τὴν περιπτωτικὴν> ἔκκλισιν “desire, that fails to get what it wills, and aversion that falls into what it would avoid.”

Why, did you ever see anyone building a cornice all around without first having a wall about which to build it?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And what kind of doorkeeper is placed on guard where there isn’t any door? But you practise to get the power to demonstrate; demonstrate what? You practise to avoid being shaken by sophisms; shaken from what? Show me first what you are maintaining, what you are measuring, or what you are weighing; and after that, and under those conditions, show me your scales or your bushel-measure. Or how long will you keep measuring ashes? Are not these what you ought to be demonstrating, the things, namely, that make men happy, that make their affairs prosper for them as they desire, that make it unnecessary for them to blame anybody, and to find fault with anybody, but to acquiesce in the government of the universe? Show me these. “See, I do show you,” a man says; “I will analyse syllogisms for you.” Slave, this is a mere measuring instrument, it is not the thing measured. That is why you are now being punished for what you neglected; you tremble, lie awake, take counsel with everyone, and, if your plans are not likely to win the approval of all men, you think that your deliberations have been faulty.

	in a bath, and stretched yourself out like men who have been crucified, you may be massaged on this side and on that; and that then the masseur may stand over you and say, “Move over, give me his side, you take his head, hand me his shoulder”; and then, when you have left the bath and gone home, that you may shout out, “Is no one bringing me something to eat?” and after that, “Clear away the tables; wipe them off with a sponge.” What [c dimgray]you[/c] are afraid of is this—that you may not be able to live the life of an invalid, since, I tell you, you have only to learn the life of healthy men—how the slaves live, the workmen, the genuine philosophers, how Socrates lived—he too with a wife and children—how Diogenes lived, how Cleanthes, who combined going to school and pumping water.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] If this is what you want, you will have it everywhere, and will live with full confidence. Confidence in what? In the only thing in which one can have confidence—in what is faithful, free from hindrance, cannot be taken away, that is, in your own moral purpose. And why have you made yourself so useless and unprofitable, that no one is willing to take you into his house, no one willing to take care of you? But when a whole and useful implement has been thrown out, anyone who finds it will pick it up and count it gain; yet not when he picks up [c dimgray]you[/c], but everyone will count [c dimgray]you[/c] a loss.

God does not give me much, no abundance, He does not want me to live luxuriously; He did not give much to Heracles, either, though he was His own son, but someone else was king over Argos and Mycenae, while he was subject, and suffered labours and discipline. And Eurystheus, such as he was, was not king over either Argos or Mycenae, for [c dimgray]he[/c] was not king even over himself; but Heracles was ruler and leader of all the land and sea, purging them of injustice and lawlessness, and introducing justice and righteousness; and all this he did naked and by himself.

Not in reputation, or money, or office, but in his own might, that means, his judgements about the things which are under our control, and those which are not under our control. For these are the only things that make men free, that make men unhampered, that lift up the neck of those who have become abject, that make them look with level eyes into the faces of the rich, and the faces of tyrants.

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The text is very uncertain. Schenkl reads Ἐν ἐπιτηδείῳ
	οὐ νοσήσεις; which would appear to mean something like: “Will you not choose a suitable house in which to fall ill?” But that sort of reply seems scarcely to fit the context.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]That is, like a slave, for this was a typical slave name, like “Sambo” among American negroes. In particular the reference seems to be to Zeno, who, when his physicians ordered him to eat young pigeons, insisted, “Cure me as you do Manes.” Musonius, frag. 18 A (p. 98, 4 ff., Fense).

And who wishes to live in grief, fear, envy, pity, desiring things and failing to get them, avoiding things and falling into them?—No one at all.—Do we find, then, any bad man free from grief or fear, not falling into what he would avoid, nor failing to achieve what he desires?—No one.—Then we find no bad man free, either.

	Now if some man who has been consul twice hear this, he will forgive you, if you add, “But [c dimgray]you[/c] are a wise man; this does not apply to you.” Yet if you tell him the truth, to wit: “In point of being a slave you are not a whit better than those who have been thrice sold,” what else can you expect but a flogging? “Why, how am I a slave?” says he. “My father was free, my mother free; no one has a deed of sale for me. More than that, I am a member of the senate, and a friend of Caesar, and I have been consul, and I own many slaves.” Now in the first place, most worthy senator, it is very likely that your father was the same kind of slave that you are, and your mother, and your grandfather, and all your ancestors from first to last. But even if they were free to the limit, what does that prove in your case? Why, what does it prove if they were noble, and you are mean-spirited? If they were brave, and you a coward? If they were self-controlled, and you unrestrained?

	And what, says someone, has this to do with being a slave?—Doesn’t it strike you as “having to do with being a slave” for a man to do something against his will, under compulsion?—Granted the point, he replies. But who can put me under compulsion, except Caesar, the lord of all?—There,

	you have yourself admitted that you have one master. And let it not comfort you that he is, as you say, the common master of all men, but realize that you are a slave in a great house. So also the men of Nicopolis[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] are wont to shout: “Yea, by the fortune of Caesar, we are free men!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	However, let us leave Caesar out of account, if you please, for the present, but answer me this: Were you never in love with anyone, a pretty girl, or pretty boy, a slave, a freedman?—What, then, has that to do with being either slave or free?—Were you never commanded by your sweetheart to do something you didn’t wish to do? Did you never cozen your pet slave? Did you never kiss his feet? Yet if someone should compel you to kiss the feet of Caesar, you would regard that as insolence and most extravagant tyranny. What else, then, is slavery? Did you never go out at night where you didn’t want to go? Did you never spend more than you wanted to spend? Did you never utter words with groaning and lamentation, endure to be reviled, to have the door shut in your face? Well, if you are ashamed to admit such things about yourself, observe what Thrasonides says and does, a man who had served on so many campaigns—perhaps more even than you have. First, he went out at night when Geta hasn’t the courage to go abroad, but, if the latter had been compelled by him to do so, he would have gone out crying aloud and bewailing his bitter slavery. And then what does Thrasonides say? Says he,

	Sad wretch, to be the slave of a wench, and a cheap one at that! Why, then, do you call yourself free any longer? And why do you talk of your campaigns? Then he calls for a sword, and gets angry at the man who refuses out of good-will to give it to him, and sends presents to the girl who hates him, and begs, and weeps, and again, when he has had a little success, he is elated. And yet even then, so long as he had not learned to give up passionate desire or fear, could this man have been in possession of freedom?

	Consider now, in the case of the animals, how we employ the concept of freedom. Men shut up tame lions in a cage, and bring them up, and feed them, and some take them around with them. And yet who will call such a lion free? Is it not true that the more softly the lion lives the more slavishly he lives? And what lion, were he to get sense and reason, would care to be one of these lions? Why, yes, and the birds yonder, when they are caught and brought up in cages, what do they suffer in their efforts to escape? And some of them starve to death rather than endure such a life, while even such as live, barely do so, and suffer and pine away,

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]There is some uncertainty about the extent of the

	and if ever they find any opening, make their escape. Such is their desire for physical freedom, and a life of independence and freedom from restraint. And what is wrong with you here in your cage? “What a question! My nature is to fly where I please, to live in the open air, to sing when I please. You rob me of all this, and then ask, ‘What is wrong with you?’ ”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	That is why we shall call free only those animals which do not submit to captivity, but escape by dying as soon as they are captured. So also Diogenes says somewhere:[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] “The one sure way to secure freedom is to die cheerfully”; and to the Persian[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] king he writes: “You cannot enslave the Athenian State any more than you can enslave the fish.” “How so? Shall I not lay hold of them?” “If you do,” he replies, “they will forthwith leave you and escape, like the fish. And that is true, for if you lay hold of one of them, it dies; and if these Athenians die when you lay hold of them, what good will you get from your armament?” That is the word of a free man who has seriously examined the matter, and, as you might expect, had discovered truth about it. But if you look for it where it does not exist, why be surprised if you never find it?

	It is the slave’s prayer that he be set free immediately. Why? Do you think it is because he is eager to pay his money to the men who collect

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Here as in II. 3 and in § 156 of this same chapter
	Epictetus seems to have used a larger collection of letters ascribed to Diogenes than that which has survived to our time. See Schenkl’s note on § 156 below.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]Schenkl deletes the word, and Orelli conjectures Μακεδόνων,
	making the reference to Philip or Alexander; but about 355 Artaxerxes Ochus seems actually to have threatened war against Athens. See Judeich in the [c dimgray]Real-Encyclopädie[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c], 2, 1319, 25 ff.

	the five per cent, tax?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] No, it is because he fancies that up till now he is hampered and uncomfortable, because he has not obtained his freedom from slavery. “If I am set free,” he says, “immediately it is all happiness, I shall pay no attention to anybody, I talk to everybody as an equal and as one in the same station in life, I go where I please, I come whence I please, and where I please.” Then he is emancipated, and forthwith, having no place to which to go and eat, he looks for someone to flatter, for someone at whose house to dine. Next he either earns a living by prostitution,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and so endures the most dreadful things, and if he gets a manger at which to eat he has fallen into a slavery much more severe than the first; or even if he grows rich, being a vulgarian he has fallen in love with a chit of a girl, and is miserable, and laments, and yearns for his slavery again. “Why, what was wrong with me? Someone else kept me in clothes, and shoes, and supplied me with food, and nursed me when I was sick; I served him in only a few matters. But now, miserable man that I am, what suffering is mine, who am a slave to several instead of one! However, if I get rings on my fingers,”[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] he says, “then indeed I shall live most prosperously and happily.” And so, first, in order to get them he submits to—what he deserves! Then when he has got them, you have the same thing over again. Next he says, “If I serve in a campaign, I am rid of all my troubles.” He serves in a campaign, he submits to all that a jail-bird suffers, but none the less he demands a second campaign and a third.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	Come, let him not be a fool, let him learn, as Socrates used to say, “What each several thing means,”[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and not apply his preconceptions at random to the particular cases. For this is the cause to men of all their evils, namely, their inability to apply their general preconceptions to the particular instances. But some of us think one thing and some another. One man fancies he is ill. Not at all; the fact is that he is not applying his preconceptions. Another fancies he is a beggar; another that he has a hard-hearted father or mother; still another that Caesar is not gracious to him. But this means one thing and one thing only—ignorance of how to apply their preconceptions. Why, who does not have a preconception of evil, that it is harmful, that it is to be avoided, that it is something to get rid of in every way? One preconception does not conflict with another, but conflict arises when one proceeds to apply them. What, then, is this evil that is harmful and is to be avoided? One person says it is not to be Caesar’s friend;[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] he is off the course, he has missed the proper application, he is in a bad way, he is looking for what is not pertinent to the case in hand; because, when he has succeeded in being Caesar’s friend, he has none the less failed to get what he was seeking. For what is it that every man is seeking? To live securely, to be happy, to do everything as he wishes to do,

	not to be hindered, not to be subject to compulsion. When, therefore, he becomes a friend of Caesar, has he been relieved of hindrance, relieved of compulsion, does he live securely, does he live serenely? From whom shall we inquire? What better witness have we than this very man who has become Caesar’s friend? Come into the midst and tell us. When did you sleep more peacefully, now or before you became Caesar’s friend? Immediately the answer comes: “Stop, I implore you by the gods, and do not jest at my lot; you don’t know what I suffer, miserable man that I am; no sleep visits me, but first one person comes in and then another and reports that Caesar is already awake, and is already coming out; then troubles, then worries!” Come, when did you dine more pleasantly, now or formerly? Listen to him and to what he has to say on this topic. If he is not invited, he is hurt, and if he is invited, he dines like a slave at a master’s table, all the time careful not to say or do something foolish. And what do you suppose he is afraid of? That he be scourged like a slave? How can he expect to get off as well as that? But as befits so great a man, a friend of Caesar, he is afraid he will lose his head. When did you take your bath in greater peace? And when did you take your exercise at greater leisure? In a word, which life would you rather live, your present life or the old one? I can take oath that no one is so insensate or so incurable as not to lament his misfortunes the more he is a friend of Caesar.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

	When, therefore, neither those who are styled kings live as they will, nor the friends of these kings, what free men are left?—Seek and you will find. For nature has given you resources to find the truth. But if you are unable of yourself, by employing these resources alone, to find the next step, listen to those who have already made the search. What do
	they say? Does freedom seem to you to be a good?—Yes,
	the greatest.—Is it possible, then, for a man who has this greatest good to be unhappy, or to fare ill?—No.—When, therefore, you see men unhappy, miserable, grieving, declare confidently that they are not free.—I do so declare.—Very well, then, we have now got away from buying and selling[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and arrangements of that kind in the acquisition of property. For if you are right in agreeing to these propositions, whether it be the Great King[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] who is unhappy, or a little king, whether it be a man of consular rank, or one who has been a consul twice, he could not be free.—Granted.

	Answer me, then, this further question: Does freedom seem to you to be a great and noble thing, and precious?—Of course.—Is it possible, then, for a man who achieves a thing so great and precious and noble, to be of abject spirit?—It is not.—When, therefore, you see one man cringing before another, or flattering him contrary to his own opinion, say confidently of this man also that he is not free; and that not merely if he be doing so for the sake of a paltry meal, but even if it be for a governorship or a consulship.

And please don’t look at his grandfathers and greatgrandfathers, or look for a deed of sale or purchase, but if you hear him say “Master,” in the centre of his being and with deep emotion, call him a slave, even if twelve fasces[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] precede him; and if you hear him say, “Alas! What I must suffer!” call him a slave; and, in short, if you see him wailing, complaining, in misery, call him a slave in a [c dimgray]toga praetexta[/c].[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] However, if he does none of these things, do not call him free yet, but find out what his judgements are, whether they are in any respect subject to compulsion, to hindrance, to unhappiness; and if you find him to be that kind of a person, call him a slave on holiday at the Saturnalia;[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] say that his master is out of town; later on he will return, and then you will learn what the fellow suffers.—Who will return?—Anyone who has control over the things which some man desires, to get these for him or to take them away.—Have
	we, then, so many masters?—Yes, so many. For even before these personal masters we have masters in the form of circumstances, and these are many. Hence, it needs must follow that those too who have authority over some one of these circumstances are our masters. Why, look you, no one is afraid of Caesar himself, but he is afraid of death, exile, loss of property, prison, disfranchisement. Nor does anyone love Caesar himself, unless in some way Caesar is a person of great merit; but we love wealth, a

	tribuneship, a praetorship, a consulship. When we love and hate and fear these things, it needs must be that those who control them are masters over us. That is why we even worship those persons as gods; for we consider that what has power to confer the greatest advantage is divine. And then we lay down the wrong minor premiss: “This man has power to confer the greatest advantage.” It needs must be that the conclusion from these premisses is wrong too.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, is it which makes a man free from hindrance and his own master? For wealth does not do it, nor a consulship, nor a province, nor a kingdom, but something else has to be found. What, therefore, is it which makes a man free from hindrance and restraint in writing?—The knowledge of how to write.—And what in playing on the harp?—The knowledge of how to play on the harp.—So also in living, it is the knowledge of how to live. Now you have already heard this, as a general principle, but consider it also in its particular applications. Is it possible for the man who is aiming at some one of these things which are under the control of others to be free from hindrance?—No.—Is it possible for him to be free from restraint?—No:—Therefore, it is not possible for him to be free, either. Consider then: Have we nothing which is under our own exclusive control, or is everything in that state; or are some things under our control and others under the control of others?—How do you mean?—When you want your body to be whole, is the matter under

	who told you, “It is your own act to take a walk unhindered”? As for me, I told you that the only unhindered thing was the desire; but where there is a use of the body and its co-operation, you have heard long ago that nothing is your own.—Granted that also.—Can anyone force you to desire what you do not want?—No one.—Or to purpose or plan, or, in a word, to deal with the impressions that come to you?—No, nor that, either; but he will hinder me, when I set my desire upon something, from achieving what I desire.—If you desire something which is your own and not subject to hindrance, how will he hinder you?—Not at all.—Who, then, tells you that the man who sets his desire upon what is not his own is free from hindrance?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Shall I not, then, set my desire on health?—No, not at all, nor on anything else which is not your own. For that which is not in your power to acquire or to keep is none of yours. Keep far away from it not merely your hands, but above all your desire; otherwise, you have delivered yourself into slavery, you have bowed your neck to the burden, if you admire anything that is not your own, if you conceive a violent passion for anything that is in subjection to another and mortal.—Is not my hand my own?—It is a part of you, but by nature it is clay, subject to hindrance and compulsion, a slave to everything that is stronger than you are. And why do I name you the hand? You ought to treat your whole body like a poor loaded-down donkey, as long as it is possible, as long as it is allowed; and if it be commandeered and a soldier lay hold of it, let it go, do not resist nor grumble. If you do, you will get a beating and lose your little donkey just the same.

	But when this is the way in which you should act as regards the body, consider what is left for you to do about all the other things that are provided for the sake of the body.

	the keep, or tower, from which a tyrant is represented as
	overawing a city.

	faculties, property, reputation, offices, honours, children, brothers, friends—count all these things as alien to us. And if the tyrants be thrown out of the spot, why should I any longer raze the fortifications of the citadel, on my own account, at least? For what harm does it do me by standing? Why should I go on and throw out the tyrant’s bodyguard? For where do I feel them? Their rods, their spears, and their swords they are directing against others. But I have never been hindered in the exercise of my will, nor have I ever been subjected to compulsion against my will.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And how is this possible? I have submitted my freedom of choice unto God. He wills that I shall have fever; it is my will too. He wills that I should choose something; it is my will too. He wills that I should desire something; it is my will too. He wills that I should get something; it is my wish too. He does not will it; I do not wish it. Therefore, it is my will to die; therefore, it is my will to be tortured on the rack. Who can hinder me any longer against my own views, or put compulsion upon me? That is no more possible in my case than it would be with Zeus.

	This is the way also with the more cautious among travellers. A man has heard that the road which he is taking is infested with robbers; he does not venture to set forth alone, but he waits for a company, either that of an ambassador, or of a quaestor, or of a proconsul, and when he has attached

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The metaphor in this passage is complicated. I take it
	to mean, using wealth as a convenient example, something
	like this: The tyrant is a false judgement (δόγμα) about
	wealth; the acropolis and the bodyguard are wealth itself,
	which is dangerous only so long as the false judgement prevails.
	Once that is overthrown, actual wealth itself need
	not be destroyed, at least for the man who is freed from the
	false judgment about it, because wealth as such has no
	longer any power over him. Other people may be menaced
	by it, but every man has a ready means of defence, which is
	to secure a correct judgement about the thing itself. Many
	matters or affairs (πράγματα) like death and disease cannot, in any event, be destroyed. It is vain labour to try to destroy the things themselves, when it is only the false judgements that are dangerous, and these any man can himself overcome.

Where shall a man flee for refuge? How shall he travel secure against robbery? What company shall he wait for that he may pass through in safety? To whom shall he attach himself? To So-and-so, the rich man, or the proconsul? And what is the good of that? He himself is stripped, groans, sorrows. Yes, and what if my fellow-traveller himself turn upon me and rob me? What shall I do? I will become a friend of Caesar; no one will wrong me if I am a companion of his. But, in the first place, the number of things I must suffer and endure in order to become his friend! and the number of times, and the number of persons by whom I must first be robbed! And then, even if I do become his friend, he too is mortal. And if some circumstance lead him to become my enemy, where indeed had I better retire? To a wilderness? What, does not fever go there? What, then, is to become of me? Is it impossible to find a fellow-traveller who is safe, faithful, strong, free from the suspicion of treachery?” Thus he reflects and comes to the thought that, if he attach himself to God, he will pass through the world in safety.

	How do you mean “attach himself”?—Why, so that whatever God wills, he also wills, and whatever God does not will, this he also does not will.—How, then, can this be done?—Why, how else than by observing the choices of God and His governance? What has He given me for my own and subject to my authority, and what has He left for Himself? Everything

	nobility of character, courage, and the very freedom for which we are now seeking.—For what purpose, then, did I receive these gifts?—To use them.—Plow long?—For as long as He who lent them to you wills.—But what if they are necessary to me?—Do not set your heart upon them, and they will not be necessary to you. Do not say to yourself that they are necessary, and they will not be.

	This is what you ought to practise from morning till evening. Begin with the most trifling things, the ones most exposed to injury, like a pot, or a cup, and then advance to a tunic, a paltry dog, a mere horse, a bit of land; thence to yourself, your body, and its members, your children, wife, brothers. Look about on every side and cast these things away from you. Purify your judgements, for fear lest something of what is not your own may be fastened to them, or grown together with them, and may give you pain when it is torn loose. And every day while you are training yourself, as you do in the gymnasium, do not say that you are “pursuing philosophy” (indeed an arrogant phrase!), but that you are a slave presenting your emancipator in court;[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] for this is the true freedom. This is the way in which Diogenes was set free by Antisthenes,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and afterwards said that he could never be enslaved again by any man.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]It is tempting to conjecture καρπιστείαν, “making provision
	for your emancipation,” since every man must win his
	own freedom for himself. But Epictetus probably is thinking
	here of a man being won to freedom by following some
	great philosopher, who is his emancipator, as in the famous
	illustration in the next sentence. It is interesting to observe
	how, with all its insistence upon individual responsibility,
	even Stoicism at this time was becoming a religion of books,
	examples, and saviours.

	He called none of them master, did he? And I am not referring to the name! it is not the word that I fear, but the emotion, which produces the word. How he censures them because they gave bad food to their captives! How he behaved when he was sold! Did he look for a master? No, but for a slave. And how he behaved toward his master after he had been sold! He began immediately to argue with him, telling him that he ought not to dress that way, or have his hair cut that way, and about his sons, how they ought to live. And what is there strange about that? Why, if he had bought a gymnastic trainer, would he have employed him as a servant, or as a master, in the exercises of the palaestra? And if he had bought a physician, or a master-builder, the same would have been true. And thus in every subject-matter, it is quite unavoidable that the man of skill should be superior to the man without skill. In general, therefore, whoever possesses the science of how to live, how can he help but be the master? For who is master in a ship?—The helmsman.—Why? Because the man who disobeys him is punished.—But my master is able to give me a sound flogging.—He cannot do so with impunity, can he?—So I thought.—But because he cannot do so with impunity, therefore he has no authority to do it; no man can do wrong with impunity.—And what is the punishment that befalls the man who has put his own slave in chains, when he felt like it?—The putting of him in chains; this is something which you will admit yourself, if you wish to maintain the proposition that man is not a wild beast but a tame animal.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] For when is a vine faring badly? When it is acting contrary to its own

	nature. When is a cock faring badly? Under the same conditions. So also man. What, then, is his nature? To bite, and kick, and throw into prison, and behead? No, but to do good, to work together, and to pray for the success of others. Therefore, he is faring badly, whether you will or no, when he acts unfeelingly.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You imply, then, that Socrates did not fare badly?—He
	did not; it was his judges and accusers who fared badly.—Nor Helvidius[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] at Rome?—No, but the man who put him to death.—How so?—Just as you too do not say that the cock which has won a victory, even though he be severely cut up, has fared badly, but rather the one who has been beaten without suffering a blow. Nor do you call a dog happy when he is neither in pursuit nor toiling hard, but when you see him sweating, suffering, bursting from the chase. What is there paradoxical in the statement, if we say that everything’s evil is what is contrary to its own nature? Is that paradoxical? Do you not say it yourself in the case of everything else? Why, then, do you take a different course in the case of man alone? But our statement that the nature of man is gentle, and affectionate, and faithful, is this not paradoxical?—No, that is not paradoxical, either.—How, then, does it come about that he suffers no harm, even though he is soundly flogged, or imprisoned, or beheaded? Is it not thus—of he bears it all in a noble spirit, and comes off with increased profit and advantage, while the other man is the one who suffers harm, the man who is subjected to the most pitiful and disgraceful experience, who becomes a wolf, or a snake, or a wasp, instead of a human being?

	Come, now, and let us review the points on which we have reached agreement. The unhampered man, who finds things ready to hand as he wants them, is free. But the man who can be hampered, or subjected to compulsion, or hindered, or thrown into something against his will, is a slave. And who is unhampered? The man who fixes his aim on nothing that is not his own. And what are the things which are not our own? All that are not under our control, either to have, or not to have, or to have of a certain quality, or under certain conditions. Therefore, the body is not our own, its members are not our own, property is not our own. If, then, you conceive a strong passion for some one of these things, as though it were your immediate possession, you will be punished as he should be who fixes his aim upon what is not his own. This is the road which leads to freedom, this is the only surcease of slavery, to be able to say at any time with your whole heart,

Did you not study the questions, what things are good, and what bad, and what are neither good nor bad?—I did.—What conclusions were approved, then, by you and your fellows?—That

	—No.—Nor imprisonment?—No.—But ignoble speech and faithless, and betrayal of a friend, and flattery of a tyrant, what did you and your fellows think of these?—We thought them evil.—What then? You are not thinking about the question now, nor have you thought about it and considered it hitherto. Why, what kind of inquiry is it, to raise the question whether it is fitting, when it is in my power to get for myself the greatest goods, not to get for myself the greatest evils! A fine and necessary question, forsooth, that requires a great deal of deliberation. Why are you making fun of us, man? Such an inquiry is never made. Besides, if you had honestly imagined that disgraceful things were bad, and all else indifferent, you would never have approached this inquiry, no, nor anything near it; but you would have been able to settle the question on the spot, by intuition, just as in a case involving sight. Why, when do you stop to “think about it,” if the question is, Are black things white, or, Are heavy things light? Do you not follow the clear evidence of your senses? How comes it, then, that now you say you are thinking it over, whether things indifferent are more to be avoided than things bad? But you do not have these judgements; on the contrary, imprisonment and death do not appear to you to be indifferent, but rather the greatest evils, and dishonourable words and deeds are not bad in your sight, but rather things that do not concern us. For that is the habit which you developed from the start. “Where am I?” you say. “In school. And who are listening to me? I am talking in the company of philosophers. But now I have left the

Watch yourself, and see how you take the word—I do not say the word that your child is dead; how could you possibly bear that?—but the word that your oil is spilled, or your wine drunk up. Well might someone stand over you, when you are in this excited condition, and say simply, “Philosopher, you talk differently in the school; why are you deceiving us? Why, when you are a worm, do you claim that you are a man?” I should like to stand over one of these philosophers when he is engaged in sexual intercourse, so as to see how he exerts himself, what manner of words he utters, whether he remembers his own name, or the arguments that he hears, or repeats, or reads!

	old women and the old men, and saying, “I cannot do this; I am not allowed”? Why are you not allowed? Were you not just now arguing with me and claiming that you were free? “But Aprulla[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] has prevented me.” Tell the truth, then, slave, and do not run away from your masters, nor make denial, nor dare to present your emancipator,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] when you have so many proofs to convict you of slavery. And, indeed, when a man out of passionate love is under the compulsion to do something contrary to his opinion, all the time seeing the better thing but lacking the strength to follow, one might be all the more inclined to regard him as deserving pity, because he is in the grip of something violent, and, in a manner of speaking, divine. But who could endure you with your passion for old women and old men, wiping the noses and washing the faces of old women, corrupting them with presents, and all the while you are nursing them, like a slave, in some illness, praying for them to die, and asking the physicians if they are finally on their deathbed? Or again, when for the sake of these mighty and dignified offices and honours you kiss the hands of other men’s slaves, so as to be the slave of men who are not even free? And then, God save the mark, you walk around in your dignity as a praetor or a consul! Don’t I know how you came to be praetor, how you got your consulship, who gave it to you? As for me, I should not care even to live, if I had to owe my life to Felicio,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] putting up with his insolence and slavish arrogance; for I know what a slave is, who is prosperous as the world goes, and puffed up with pride.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	Are [c dimgray]you[/c], then, free, says someone?—By the gods I wish to be, and pray to be, but I am not yet able to look into the face of my masters, I still honour my paltry body, I take great pains to keep it sound, although it is not sound in any case.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] But I can show you a free man, so that you will never again have to look for an example. Diogenes was free. How did that come? It was not because he was born of free parents, for he was not, but because he himself was free, because he had cast off all the handles of slavery, and there was no way in which a person could get close and lay hold of him to enslave him. Everything he had was easily loosed, everything was merely tied on.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] If you had laid hold of his property, he would have let it go rather than followed you for its sake; if you had laid hold of his leg, he would have let his leg go; if of his whole paltry body, his whole paltry body; and so also his kindred, friends, and country. He knew the source from which he had received them, and from whom, and upon what conditions. His true ancestors, indeed, the gods, and his real Country[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]
	he would never have abandoned, nor would he have suffered another to yield them more obedience and submission, nor could any other man have died more cheerfully for his Country. For it was never his wont to seek to [c dimgray]appear[/c] to do anything in behalf of the Universe,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] but he bore in mind that everything which has come into being has its source there, and is done on behalf of that Country, and is entrusted

	to us by Him who governs it. Therefore, see what he himself says and writes: “For this reason,” he says, “you are permitted, O Diogenes, to converse as you please with the king of the Persians and with Archidamus, the king of the Lacedaemonians.” Was it, indeed, because he was born of free parents? No doubt it was because they were all the children of slaves that the Athenians, and Lacedaemonians, and Corinthians were unable to converse with these monarchs as they pleased, but were afraid of them and paid court to them! Why, then, someone asks, are you permitted? “Because I do not regard my paltry body as my own; because I need nothing; because the law, and nothing else, is everything to me.” This it was which allowed him to be a free man.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And that you may not think I am showing you an example of a man who was solitary, and had neither wife, nor children, nor country, nor friends, nor kinsmen, who might have bent him and diverted him from his purpose, take Socrates and observe a man who had a wife and little children, but regarded them as not his own, who had a country, as far as it was his duty, and in the way in which it was his duty, and friends, and kinsmen, one and all subject to the law and to obedience to the law. That is why, when it was his duty to serve as a soldier, he was the first to leave home, and ran the risks of battle most ungrudgingly; and when he was sent by the Tyrants to fetch Leon,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] because he regarded it as disgraceful, he never deliberated about the matter at all, although he knew that he would have to die, if it so chanced. And what difference did it make to him? For there was

	something else that he wished to preserve; not his paltry flesh, but the man of honour, the man of reverence, that he was. These are things which are not to be entrusted to another, not to be made subject. Later on, when he had to speak in defence of his life, he did -not behave as one who had children, or a wife, did he? Nay, but as one who was alone in the world. Yes, and when he had to drink the poison, how does he act? When he might have saved his life, and when Crito said to him,
	“Leave the prison for the sake of your children,”
	what is his reply? Did he think it a bit of good luck? Impossible! No, he regards what is fitting, and as for other considerations, he does not so much as look at or consider them. For he did not care, he says, to save his paltry body, but only that which is increased and preserved by right conduct, and is diminished and destroyed by evil conduct.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Socrates does not save his life with dishonour, the man who refused to put the vote when the Athenians demanded it of him,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] the man who despised the Tyrants, the man who held such noble discourse about virtue and moral excellence; this man it is impossible to save by dishonour, but he is saved by death,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and not by flight. Yes, and the good actor, too, is saved when he stops at the right time, rather than the one who acts out of season.

	Palace—a slave none the less; and you will perceive that, as Cleanthes[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] used to say,” Possibly the philosophers say what is contrary to opinion, but assuredly not what is contrary to reason.” For you will learn by experience that what they say is true, and that none of these things which are admired and sought after are of any good to those who attain them; while those who have not yet attained them get an impression that, if once these things come to them, they will be possessed of all things good, and then, when they do come, the burning heat is just as bad, there is the same tossing about on the sea, the same sense of surfeit, the same desire for what they do not have. For freedom is not acquired by satisfying yourself with what you desire, but by destroying your desire. And that you may learn the truth of all this, as you have toiled for those other things, so also transfer your toil to these; keep vigils for the sake of acquiring a judgement which will make you free, devote yourself to a philosopher instead of to a rich old man, be seen about [c dimgray]his[/c] doors; it will be no disgrace to be so seen, you will not retire thence empty and without profit, if you approach him in the right fashion. Anyway, try it at least; there is no disgrace in making the attempt.

	acquaintances or friends as to descend to the same level with him; otherwise you will ruin yourself. But if there slips into your mind the thought, “He will think me unmannerly and will not be as friendly as he used to be,” remember that nothing is done without paying for it, and that it is impossible for a man to remain the same person that he used to be, if he does not do the same things. Choose, therefore, which you prefer; either to be loved just as much as you used to be by the same persons, remaining like your former self, or else, by being superior to your former self, to lose the same affection. Because if this latter alternative is the better choice, turn forthwith in that direction, and let not the other considerations draw you away; for no man is able to make progress when he is facing both ways. But if you have preferred this course to every other, if you wish to devote yourself to this alone, and labour to perfect it, give up everything else. Otherwise this facing both ways will bring about a double result: You will neither make progress as you ought, nor will you get what you used to get before. For before, when you frankly aimed at nothing worth while, you made a pleasant companion. You cannot achieve distinction along both lines, but you must needs fall short in the one to the degree in which you take part in the other. If you do not drink with those you used to drink with, you cannot in their eyes be as pleasant a companion as you used to be; choose, therefore, whether you wish to be a hard drinker and pleasant to those persons, or a sober man and unpleasant. If you do not sing with those you used to sing with, you cannot be loved by them as you used to be; choose,

	therefore, here also, which you wish. For if it is better to be a man of respectful and modest behaviour than for someone to say of you, “He is a pleasant fellow,” give up all other considerations, renounce them, turn your back upon them, have nothing to do with them. But if that does not please you, turn about, the whole of you, to the opposite; become one of the addicts to unnatural vice, one of the adulterers, and act in the corresponding fashion, and you will get what you wish. Yes, and jump up and shout your applause to the dancer. But different characters do not mix in this fashion; you cannot act the part of Thersites and that of Agamemnon too. If you wish to be a Thersites, you ought to be humpbacked and bald; if an Agamemnon, you ought to be tall and handsome, and to love those who have been made subject to you.

	spent to no purpose, and all the pains you are now taking with yourself you are sure to spill out utterly and upset. Little is needed to ruin and upset everything, only a slight aberration from reason. For the helmsman to upset his ship he does not need the same amount of preparation that he does to keep it safe; but if he heads it a little too much into the wind, he is lost; yes, even if he does nothing by his own deliberate choice, but merely falls to thinking about something else for a moment, he is lost. In life also it is very much the same; if you doze but for a moment, all that you have amassed hitherto is gone. Pay attention, therefore, to your sense-impressions, and watch over them sleeplessly. For it is no small matter that you are guarding, but self-respect, and fidelity, and constancy, a state of mind undisturbed by passion, pain, fear, or confusion—in a word, freedom. What are the things for which you are about to sell [c dimgray]these[/c] things? Look, how valuable are they?—But, you say, I shall not get anything of that kind in return for what I am giving up.—Observe also, when you do get something in the exchange, just what it is you are getting for what you give up.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] “I have a modest behaviour, he has a tribuneship; he has a praetorship, I have self-respect.

What difference does it make to say, “I am in a bad way, I have nothing to do, but am tied to my books as though I were a corpse,” or to say, “I am in a bad way, I have no leisure to read”?

If you turn to reading merely for entertainment, or in order to learn something, you are futile and lazy. But if you refer reading to the proper standard, what else is this but a life of serenity? However, if reading does not secure for you a life of serenity, of what good is it?—Nay, it does secure me serenity, one says, and that is why I am discontented because I am deprived of it,—And
	what kind of serenity is this which any chance comer can impede, not merely Caesar, or a friend of Caesar, but a crow, a flutist, fever, thirty thousand other things? But no feature of serenity is so characteristic as continuity and freedom from hindrance.

	Come, if you have acted like this and devoted yourself to these things, have you done anything worse than reading a thousand lines, or writing a thousand?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] For when you eat, are you annoyed because you are not reading? Are you not satisfied to be eating in accordance with the principles you learned by reading? And when you bathe and take exercise? Why, then, are you not consistent in everything, both when you approach Caesar, and when you approach So-and-so? If you are maintaining the character of a man of tranquillity, of imperturbability, of sedateness, if you are observing what happens rather than being yourself observed, if you are not envying those who are preferred in honour above you, if the mere subject-matter of actions does not dazzle you, what do you lack? Books? How, or for what end? What, is not the reading of books a kind of preparation for the act of living? But the full measure of the act of living is made up of things other than books. It is as though the athlete on entering the stadium were to fall a-wailing because he is not exercising outside. This was what you exercised for, this is the purpose of your jumping-weights,
	your wrestler’s sand,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] your young training partners. And are you now asking for these things, when the time for action is come? It is as if, when in the sphere of assent we were surrounded with sense-impressions, some of them convincing, and others not convincing, we should not wish to distinguish between them, but to read a treatise [c dimgray]On Comprehension[/c]!

	accordance with nature the sense-impressions which come to us; but we stop with having learned what is said, and with the ability to explain it to someone else, and with analysing the syllogism, and examining the hypothetical argument. That is why, where our heart is set, there also our impediment lies. Do you wish at any cost to have the things that are not under your control? Very well then, be hindered, be obstructed, fail. If we should read a treatise [c dimgray]On Choice[/c], not in order to know about the subject, but in order to make correct choices; a treatise [c dimgray]On Desire and Aversion[/c], in order that we may never fail in our desire nor fall into that which we are trying to avoid; a treatise [c dimgray]On Duty[/c], in order that we may remember our relations in society and do nothing irrationally or contrary to the principles of duty; we should not be vexed by being hindered in regard to what we have read, but we should find satisfaction in doing the deeds required by our mutual relations, and we should be reckoning, not the things which we have been accustomed hitherto to reckon:
	“To-day I have read so many lines, I have written so many,” but, “To-day I made a choice in the way that the philosophers teach, I did not entertain desire, I avoided only those things that are in the sphere of the moral purpose, I was not overawed by So-and-so, I was not put out of countenance by So-and-so, I exercised my patience, my abstinence, my co-operation,” and thus we should be giving thanks to God for those things for which we ought to give Him thanks.

	But as it is, we do not realize that we ourselves, though in a different fashion, grow like the multitude. Another man is afraid that he will not have an office; you are afraid that you will. Do not so,

	man! But just as you laugh at the man who is afraid he will not have an office, so also laugh at yourself. For it makes no difference whether a person is thirsty with fever, or is afraid of water like a man with the rabies. Or how can you any longer say with Socrates, “If so it please God, so be it”?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Do you suppose that, if Socrates had yearned to spend his leisure in the Lyceum or the Academy,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and to converse daily with the young men, he would have gone forth cheerfully on all the military expeditions in which he served? Would he not have wailed and groaned, “Wretched man that I am! here I am now in misery and misfortune, when I might be sunning myself in the Lyceum”? What, was this your function in life, to sun yourself? Was it not rather to be serene, to be unhampered, to be unhindered? And how would he have been Socrates any longer, if he had wailed like this? How would he have gone on to write paeans in prison?[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]

	In a word, then, remember this—that if you are going to honour anything at all outside the sphere of the moral purpose, you have destroyed your moral purpose. And outside the sphere of your moral purpose lie not merely office, but also freedom from office; not merely business, but also leisure. “Am I now, therefore, to pass my life in this turmoil? “What do you mean by “turmoil”? Among many people? And what is there hard about that? Imagine that you are in Olympia, regard the turmoil as a festival.

	that; one man jostles another; there is a crowd in the baths.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And yet who of us does not take delight in the Olympic festival and leave it with sorrow? Do not become peevish or fastidious towards events.
	“The vinegar is rotten, for it is sour,” “The honey is rotten, for it upsets my digestion.” “I don’t like vegetables.” In the same fashion you say, “I don’t like leisure, it is a solitude.” “I don’t like a crowd, it is turmoil.” Say not so, but if circumstances bring you to spend your life alone or in the company of a few, call it peace, and utilize the condition for its proper end; converse with yourself, exercise your sense-impressions, develop your preconceptions. If, however, you fall in with a crowd, call it games, a festival, a holiday, try to keep holiday with the people. For what is pleasanter to a man who loves his fellow-men than the sight of large numbers of them?[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] We are glad to see herds of horses or cattle; when we see many ships we are delighted; is a person annoyed at the sight of many human beings? “Yes, but they deafen me with their shouting.” Oh, well, it is your hearing that is interfered with! What, then, is that to you? Your faculty of employing external impressions is not interfered with, is it? And who prevents you from making natural use of desire and aversion, of choice and refusal?

	attributed to Abraham Lincoln: “God must have loved
	the common people; He made so many of them.” The
	characteristic emotions here indicated as arising at the contemplation of large numbers of one’s fellow-men, though somewhat different in tone from that in Epictetus, as well as from one another, are still essentially at one with the Stoic ideal of sympathetic fellowship, and are fundamentally opposed to that selfish or snobbish aversion towards mankind, which became so prevalent, even in religious circles, during the great decadence of ancient civilization.

	Do but keep in remembrance your general principles: “What is mine? What is not mine? What has been given me? What does God will that I do now, what does He not will?” A little while ago it was His will for you to be at leisure, to converse with yourself, to write about these things, to read, to listen, to prepare yourself; you had time sufficient for that. Now God says to you, “Come at length to the contest, show us what you have learned, how you have trained yourself. How long will you exercise alone? Now the time has come for you to discover whether you are one of the athletes who deserve victory, or belong to the number of those who travel about the world and are everywhere defeated.”
	Why, then, are you discontented? No contest is held without turmoil. There must be many training-partners, many to shout applause, many officials, many spectators.—But I wanted to live a life of peace.—Wail, then, and groan, as you deserve to do. For what greater penalty can befall the man who is uninstructed and disobedient to the divine injunctions than to grieve, to sorrow, to envy, in a word to have no good fortune but only misfortune? Do you not wish to free yourself from all this?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And how shall I free myself?—Have you not heard over and over again that you ought to eradicate desire utterly, direct your aversion towards the things that lie within the sphere of the moral purpose, and these things only, that you ought to give up everything, your body, your property, your reputation, your books, turmoil, office, freedom from office? For if once you swerve aside from this course, you are a slave, you are a subject, you have become liable to hindrance and to compulsion, you

The Evil Genius, though seldom referred to (and in fact ignored by many, if not all the standard works of reference, I believe), is presupposed by the association of the Κακοδαιμονισταί
	(Lysias, frag. 53, 2, Thalheim), and by the very word κακοδαίμων itself. For similar devil-worship, cf. I. 19, 6, of the God Fever.

That is why I cannot call a man industrious, if I hear merely that he reads or writes, and even if one adds that he sits up all night, I cannot yet say that the man is industrious, until I know for what end he does so. For neither do you call a man industrious who loses sleep for the sake of a wench; no more do I. But if he acts this way for the sake of reputation, I call him ambitious; if for the sake of money, I call him fond of money, not fond of toil. If, however, the end for which he toils is his own governing principle, to have it be, and live continually, in accordance with nature, then and then only I call him industrious. For I would not have you men ever either praise or blame a man for things that may be either good or bad, but only for judgements. Because these are each man’s own possessions, which make his actions either base or noble. Bearing all this in mind, rejoice in what you have and be satisfied with what the moment brings. If you see any of the things that you have learned and studied thoroughly coming to fruition for you in action, rejoice in these things.

	arguments.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] For Socrates bore very firmly in mind that no one is master over another’s governing principle. He willed, accordingly, nothing but what was his own. And what is that? \[Not to try to make other people act[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]\] in accordance with nature, for that does not belong to one; but, while they are attending to their own business as they think best, himself none the less to be and to remain in a state of harmony with nature, attending only to his own business, to the end that they also may be in harmony with nature. For this is the object which the good and excellent man has ever before him. To become praetor? No; but if this be given him, to maintain his own governing principle in these circumstances. To marry? No; but if marriage be given him, to maintain himself as one who in these circumstances is in harmony with nature. But if he wills that his son or his wife make no mistake, he wills that what is not his own should cease to be not his own. And to be getting an education means this: To be learning what [c dimgray]is[/c] your own, and what is [c dimgray]not[/c] your own.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Where, then, is there any longer room for contention, if a man is in such a state? Why, he is not filled with wonder at anything that happens, is he? Does anything seem strange to him? Does he not expect worse and harsher treatment from the wicked than actually befalls him? Does he not count it as gain whenever they fail to go to the limit?

	and his faithfulness? This is the kind of person for whom “men should come together and mourn, because of all the evils into which he has come”; not, by Zeus, “the one who is born,” or
	“the one who has died,”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] but the man whose misfortune it has been while he still lives to lose what is his own; not his patrimony, his paltry farm, and paltry dwelling, and his tavern, and his poor slaves (for none of these things is a man’s own possession, but they all belong to others, are subservient and subject, given by their masters[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] now to one person and now to another); but the qualities which make him a human being, the imprints which he brought with him in his mind, such as we look for also upon coins, and, if we find them, we accept the coins, but if we do not find them, we throw the coins away. “Whose imprint does this sestertius bear? Trajan’s? Give it to me. Nero’s? Throw it out, it will not pass, it is rotten.”[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] So also in the moral life. What imprint do his
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The quotations (slightly modified) are from a famous
	passage in Euripides, [c dimgray]Cresphontes[/c], frag. 449, Nauck[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]: “For
	we ought rather to come together to mourn for the one who
	is born, because of all the evils into which he is coming;
	but, on the other hand, the one who has died, we ought with
	joy and words of gladness to send forth from his former
	abode.”
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The gods.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]This reference is most obscure, for the coins of Nero still
	preserved are numerous and excellent, and there was a great
	systematic reform of coinage in a.d. 64, which became “the
	most complete monetary system of ancient times” (Mattingly
	and Sydenham, [c dimgray]The Roman Imperial Coinage[/c] (1923), I, 138).
	After the death of Caligula, indeed, the senate ordered all
	his bronze coinage to be melted down (Dio, LX. 22, 3), but
	nothing of the sort is recorded, so far as I know, for Nero.
	There was, of course, a slight reduction in weight for the
	aureus and the denarius, and “the amount of alloy in the
	silver was increased from 5 to about 10 per cent.,” changes
	which have been regarded as the first step in the process
	of debasement that reached its climax in the third century. See E. A. Sydenham, [c dimgray]Num. Chron.,[/c] ser. 4, vol. 16 (1916), 19. Nero’s particular system of brass and copper coinage was also discontinued after his death ([c dimgray]ibid.[/c] p. 28). Yet it is scarcely credible that Epictetus can have had any trifles like these in mind.—Of course the [c dimgray]moral[/c] point here, which Dr. Page wishes to have emphasized, is that Trajan was the typically good man ([c dimgray]felicior Augusto, melior Traiano[/c] was an acclamation in the Roman Senate for centuries after his death -Eutropius, 8, 5), and Nero the opposite. But the difficulty in the passage is to understand how it ever occurred to Epictetus to imply that people actually refused to take coins of Nero, simply because they bore the imprint of a morally bad man, when, as a matter of fact, it is extremely doubtful if any human being, except perhaps some hopeless fanatic, ever really did so refuse. A note by T. O. Mabbott, “Epictetus and Nero’s Coinage”, [c dimgray]CP[/c] 36 (1941) 398–9, explains this perfectly.

Only see that he does not have the imprint of Nero. Is he choleric, furious, querulous? “If he feels like it, he punches the heads of the people he meets.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Why, then, did you call him a human being? For surely everything is not judged by its outward appearance only, is it? Why, if that is so, you will have to call the lump of beeswax an apple.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] No, it must have the smell of an apple and the taste of an apple; its external outline is not enough. Therefore, neither are the nose and the eyes sufficient to prove that one is a human being, but you must see whether one has the judgements that belong to a human being. Here is a man who does not listen to reason, he does not understand when he is confuted; he is an ass. Here is one whose sense of self-respect has grown numb; he is useless, a sheep, anything but a human being. Here is a man who is looking for someone whom he can kick or bite when he meets him; so that [c dimgray]he[/c] is not even a sheep or an ass, but some wild beast.

	do you mean by the word “me”? Can anyone hurt your moral purpose, or prevent you from employing in a natural way the sense-impressions which come to you?—No.—Why, then, are you any longer disturbed, and why do you want to show that you are a timid person? Why do you not come forth and make the announcement that you are at peace with all men, no matter what they do, and that you are especially amused at those who think that they are hurting you? “These slaves do not know either who I am, or where my good and my evil are; they cannot get at the things that are mine.”

	These are the things which make a city strong and secure against capture, and nothing but judgements make similarly secure the soul of man. For what manner of wall is so strong, or what manner of body so invincible, or what manner of possession so secure against theft, or what manner of reputation so unassailable? For all things everywhere are perishable, and easy to capture by assault, and the man who in any fashion sets his mind upon any of them must needs be troubled in mind, be discouraged, suffer fear and sorrow, have his desires fail, and his aversions fall into what they would avoid. If this be so, are we not willing to make secure the one means of safety which has been vouchsafed us?

	nature free? And do we not remember that no man either hurts or helps another, but that it is his judgement about each of these things which is the thing that hurts him, that overturns him; this is contention, and civil strife, and war? That which made Eteocles and Polyneices[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] what they were was nothing else but this—their judgement about a throne, and their judgement about exile, namely, that one was the greatest of evils, the other the greatest of goods. And this is the nature of every being, to pursue the good and to flee from the evil; and to consider the man who robs us of the one and invests us with the other as an enemy and an aggressor, even though he be a brother, even though he be a son, even though he be a father; for nothing is closer kin to us than our good. It follows, then, that if these externals are good or evil, neither is a father dear to his sons, nor a brother dear to a brother, but everything on all sides is full of enemies, aggressors, slanderers. But if the right kind of moral purpose and that alone is good, and if the wrong kind of moral purpose and that alone is bad, where is there any longer room for contention, where for reviling? About what? About the things that mean nothing to us? Against whom? Against the ignorant, against the unfortunate, against those who have been deceived in the most important values?

	them that I do not deserve their pity.—And do you now possess the power of not being deserving of pity, or do you not possess it?—It seems to me, indeed, that I possess it. Yet these people do not pity me for what would deserve pity, if anything does, that is, my mistakes; but for poverty, and for not holding office, and for things like disease, and death, and the like.—Are you, then, prepared to convince the multitude that none of these things is bad, but that it is possible for a poor man, and one who holds no office or position of honour, to be happy; or are you prepared to show yourself off to them as a rich man and an official? Of these alternatives the second is the part of a braggart, and a tasteless and worthless person. Besides, observe the means by which you must achieve your pretence: You will have to borrow some paltry slaves; and possess a few pieces of silver plate, and exhibit these same pieces conspicuously and frequently, if you can, and try not to let people know that they are the same; and possess contemptible bright clothes, and all other kinds of finery, and show yourself off as the one who is honoured by the most distinguished persons; and try to dine with them, or at least make people think that you dine with them; and resort to base arts in the treatment of your person, so as to appear more shapely and of gentler birth than you actually are. All these contrivances you must adopt, if you wish to take the way of the second alternative and avoid pity.

And despite that, bless me! are you now trying to convince all other men? Yet who has been living with you so long as you have been living with yourself? And who is so gifted with powers of persuasion to convince you, as you are to convince yourself? Who is more kindly disposed and nearer to you than you are to yourself? How comes it, then, that you have not persuaded yourself to learn? Are not things now upside down? Is this what you have been in earnest about? Not to learn how to get rid of pain, and turmoil, and humiliation, and so become free? Have you not heard that there is but a single way which leads to this end, and that is to give up the things which lie outside the sphere of the moral purpose, and to abandon them, and to admit that they are not your own? To what class of things, then, does another’s opinion about you belong?—To that which lies outside the sphere of the moral purpose.—And so it is nothing to you?—Nothing.—So

And yet, indeed, in everything else that I have wanted I was not found to be unusually dull, but I learned my letters rapidly, and how to wrestle, and do my geometry, and analyse syllogisms. Can it be, then, that reason has not convinced me? Why, indeed, there is nothing to which I have so given my approval from the very first, or so preferred, and now I read about these matters, and hear them, and write about them. Down to this moment we have not found a stronger argument than this. What is it, then, that I yet lack? Can it be that the contrary judgements have not all been put away? Can it be that the thoughts themselves are unexercised and unaccustomed to face the facts, and, like old pieces of armour that have been stowed away, are covered with rust, and can no longer be fitted to me? Yet in wrestling, or in writing, or in reading, I am not satisfied with mere learning, but I turn over and over the arguments presented to me, and fashion new ones, and likewise syllogisms with equivocal premisses. However, the necessary principles, those which enable a man, if he sets forth from them, to get rid of grief, fear, passion, hindrance, and become free, these I do not exercise, nor do I take the practice that is appropriate for them. After all that, am I concerned with what everyone else will say about me, whether I shall appear important or happy in their eyes?”

And is the man who is pained worthy of pity?—Yes.—How, then, do you fail to deserve pity after all? By the very emotion which you feel concerning pity you make yourself worthy of pity. What, then, says Antisthenes? Have you never heard?
	“It is the lot of a king, O Cyrus, to do well, but to be ill spoken of.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] My head is perfectly sound and yet everybody thinks I have a headache. What do I care? I have no fever, and yet everybody sympathizes with me as though I had: “Poor fellow, you have had a fever for ever so long.” I draw a long face too, and say, “Yes, it truly is a long time that I have been in a bad way.” “What is going to happen, then?” As God will, I reply, and at the same time I smile quietly to myself at those who are pitying me.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, prevents me from doing the same thing in my moral life also? I am poor, but I have a correct judgement about poverty. Why, then, am I concerned, if men pity me for my poverty? I do not hold office, while others do. But I have the right opinion about holding office and not holding it. Let those who pity me look to it,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] but as for myself, I am neither hungry, nor thirsty, nor cold, but from their own hunger and thirst they think I too am hungry and thirsty. What, then, am I to do for them? Shall I go about and make proclamation, and say, “Men, be not deceived, it is well with me.

	But others will get more than I do, and will be preferred in honour above me.—Well, and what is more reasonable than for those who have devoted themselves to something to have the advantage in that to which they have devoted themselves? They have devoted themselves to office, you to judgements; and they to wealth, you to dealing with your sense-impressions. See whether they have the advantage over you in what you have devoted yourself to, but they neglect; whether their assent is more in accord with natural standards, whether their desire is less likely to achieve its aim than is yours, whether their aversion is less likely to fall into what it would avoid, whether in design, purpose, and choice they hit the mark better, whether they observe what becomes them as men, as sons, as parents, and then, in order, through all the other terms for the social relations. But if they hold office, will you not tell yourself the truth, which is, that you do nothing in order to get office, while they do everything, and that it is most unreasonable for the man who pays attention to something to come off with less than the man who neglects it?

	rule.—Yes, in what you greatly concern yourself with, that is, judgements; but in that with which other men have concerned themselves more greatly than you have, give place to them. It is as though, because you have correct judgements, you insisted that you ought in archery to hit the mark better than the archers, or to surpass the smiths at their trade. Drop, therefore, your earnestness about judgements, and concern yourself with the things which you wish to acquire, and [c dimgray]then[/c] lament if you do not succeed, for you have a right to do that. But as it is, you claim to be intent upon other things, to care for other things, and there is wisdom in what common people say, “One serious business has no partnership with another.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] One man gets up at early dawn and looks for someone of the household of Caesar to salute, someone to whom he may make a pleasant speech, to whom he may send a present, how he may please the dancer, how he may gratify one person by maliciously disparaging another. When he prays, he prays for these objects, when he sacrifices, he sacrifices for these objects. The word of Pythagoras,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	business did you have to say that? For wasn’t it possible to lie? Even the philosophers say that there is nothing to hinder one’s telling a lie.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] But if in all truth you have concerned yourself greatly with nothing but the proper use of sense-impressions, then as soon as you get up in the morning bethink you, “What do I yet lack in order to achieve tranquillity? What to achieve calm? What am I? I am not a paltry body, not property, not reputation, am I? None of these. Well, what am I? A rational creature.” What, then, are the demands upon you? Rehearse your actions.
	“ ‘Where did I go wrong?’ in matters conducive to serenity? ‘What did I do’ that was unfriendly, or unsocial, or unfeeling? ‘What to be done was left undone’ in regard to these matters?”

	Since, therefore, there is so great a difference between the things which men desire, their deeds, and their prayers, do you still wish to be on an equal footing with them in matters to which you have not devoted yourself, but they have? And after all that, are you surprised if they pity you, and are you indignant? But they are not indignant if you pity them. And why? Because they are convinced that they are getting good things, while you are not so convinced in your own case. That is why you are not satisfied with what you have, but reach out for what they have. Because, if you had been truly convinced that, in the case of the things which are good, you are the one who is attaining them, while they have gone astray, you would not even have taken account of what they say about you.

	[b][c dimgray]Of freedom from fear[/c][/b]
	What makes the tyrant an object of fear?—His guards, someone says, and their swords, and the chamberlain, and those who exclude persons who would enter.—Why, then, is it that, if you bring a child into the presence of the tyrant while he is with his guards, the child is not afraid? Is it because the child does not really feel the presence of the guards? If, then, a man really feels their presence, and that they have swords, but has come for that very purpose, for the reason that he wishes to die because of some misfortune, and he seeks to do so easily at the hand of another, he does not fear the guards, does he?—No, for what makes them terrible is just what he wants.—If, then, a man who has set his will neither upon dying nor upon living at any cost, but only as it is given him to live, comes into the presence of the tyrant, what is there to prevent such a man from coming into his presence without fear?—Nothing.—If,
	then, a man feel also about his property just as this other person feels about his body, and so about his children, and his wife, and if, in brief, he be in such a frame of mind, due to some madness or despair, that he cares not one whit about having, or not having, these things; but, as children playing with potsherds strive with one another about the game, but take no thought about the potsherds themselves, so this man also has reckoned the material things of life as nothing, but is glad to play with them and handle them—what kind of tyrant, or guards, or swords in the hands of guards can any more inspire fear in the breast of such a man?

	Therefore, if madness can produce this attitude of mind toward the things which have just been mentioned, and also habit, as with the Galilaeans,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] cannot reason and demonstration teach a man that God has made all things in the universe, and the whole universe itself to be free from hindrance, and to contain its end in itself, and the parts of it to serve the needs of the whole? Now all other animals have been excluded from the capacity to understand the governance of God, but the rational animal, man, possesses faculties that enable him to consider all these things, both that he is a part of them, and what kind of part of them he is, and that it is well for the parts to yield to the whole. And furthermore, being by nature noble, and high-minded, and free, the rational animal, man, sees that he has some of the things which are about him free from hindrance and under his control, but that others are subject to hindrance and under the control of others. Free from hindrance are those things which lie in the sphere of the moral purpose, and subject to hindrance are those which lie outside the sphere of the moral purpose. And so, if he regards his own good and advantage as residing in these things alone, in those, namely, which are free from hindrance and under his control, he will be free, serene, happy, unharmed, high-minded, reverent, giving thanks for all things to God, under no circumstances finding fault with anything that has happened, nor blaming anything; if, however, he regards his good and advantage as residing in externals and things outside the sphere of his moral purpose, he must needs be hindered and restrained, be a slave to those who have control over these things

If they find me wanting to enter, let them lock the door in my face!—Why, then, do you go to the gate of the palace?—Because I think it fitting for me to join in the game while the game lasts.—How, then, is it that you are not locked out?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]—Because, if anyone will not receive me, I do not care to go in, but always I wish rather the thing which takes place. For I regard God’s will as better than my will. I shall attach myself to Him as a servant and follower, my choice is one with His, my desire one with His, in a word, my will is one with His will. No door is locked in my face, but rather in the face of those who would force themselves in. Why, then, do I not force myself in? Why, because I know that within nothing good is distributed among those who have entered. But when I hear someone called blessed,

Does he, then, get also the ability to administer a procuratorship? Why should I any longer push my way in? Somebody is scattering dried figs and nuts; the children snatch them up and fight with one another, the men do not, for they count this a small matter. But if somebody throws potsherds around, not even the children snatch them up. Governorships are being passed around. The children shall see[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] to that. Money. The children shall see to that. A praetorship, a consulship. Let the children snatch them up; let the children have the door locked in their faces, take a beating, kiss the hands of the giver, and the hands of his slaves. As for me, it’s a mere scattering of dried figs and nuts.” But what, then, if, when the man is throwing them about, a dried fig chances to fall into my lap? I take it up and eat it. For I may properly value even a dried fig as much as that. But neither a dried fig, nor any other of the things not good, which the philosophers have persuaded me not to think good, is of sufficient value to warrant my grovelling and upsetting someone else, or being upset by him, or flattering those who have flung the dried figs among us.

	want me, then, to respect and do obeisance to all these things, and to go about as the slave of them all? Far from it! But if once I have learned that what is born must also perish, so that the world may not stand still, nor be hampered, it makes no difference to me whether a fever shall bring that consummation, or a tile, or a soldier; but, if I must make a comparison, I know that the soldier will bring it about with less trouble and more speed. Seeing, therefore, that I neither fear anything of all that the tyrant is able to do with me, nor greatly desire anything of all that he is able to provide, why do I any longer admire him, why any longer stand in awe of him? Why am I afraid of his guards? Why do I rejoice if he speaks kindly to me and welcomes me, and why do I tell others how he spoke to me? He is not Socrates, is he, or Diogenes, so that his praise should be a proof of what I am? I have not been ambitious to imitate his character, have I? Nay, but acting as one who keeps the game going, I come to him and serve him so long as he commands me to do nothing foolish or unseemly. If, however, he says, “Go and bring Leon of Salamis,”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] I reply, “Try to get someone else, for I am not playing any longer.” “Take him off to prison,” says the tyrant about me. “I follow, because that is part of the game.” “But your head will be taken off.” And does the tyrant’s head always stay in its place, and the heads of you who obey him? “But you will be thrown out unburied.”[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] If the corpse is I, then I shall be thrown out; but if I am something different from

	Oh yes, but statements like these make men despise the laws.—Quite the contrary, what statements other than these make the men who follow them more ready to obey the laws? Law is not simply anything that is in the power of a fool. And yet see how these statements make us behave properly even toward these fools, because they teach us to claim against such persons nothing in which they can surpass us. They teach us to give way when it comes to our paltry body, to give way when it comes to our property, to our children, parents, brothers, to retire from everything, let everything go; they except only our judgements, and it was the will of Zeus also that these should be each man’s special possession. What do you mean by speaking of lawlessness and stupidity here? Where you are superior and stronger, there I give way to you; and again, where I am superior, you retire in favour of me.

But a judgement is not readily determined by externals. “This man is a carpenter.” Why? “He uses an adze.” What, then, has that to do with the case? “This man is a musician, for he sings.” And what has that to do with the case? “This man is a philosopher.” Why? “Because he wears a rough cloak and long hair.” And what do hedge-priests wear? That is why, when a man sees some one of them misbehaving, he immediately says, “See what the philosopher is doing.” But he ought rather to have said, judging from the misbehaviour, that the person in question was not a philosopher. For if the prime conception and profession of the philosopher is to wear a rough cloak and long hair, their statement would be correct; but if it is rather this, to be free from error, why do they not take away from him the designation of philosopher, because he does not fulfil the profession of one? For that is the way men do in the case of the other arts. When someone sees a fellow hewing clumsily with an axe, he does not say, “What’s the use of carpentry? See the bad work the carpenters do! “but quite the contrary, he says, “This fellow is no

	carpenter, for he hews clumsily with the axe.” And, similarly, if a man hears somebody singing badly, he does not say, “See how the musicians sing!” but rather, “This fellow is no musician.” But it is only in the case of philosophy that men behave like this; when they see somebody acting contrary to the profession of the philosopher, they do not take away from him the designation of philosopher, but, assuming that he is a philosopher, and then taking[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] from what goes on that he is misbehaving, they conclude that there is no good in being a philosopher.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, is the reason for this? It is because we respect the prime conception of the carpenter, and the musician, and so also of all the other artisans and artists, while we do not respect that of the philosopher, but as if it were confused and inarticulate in our minds we judge of it only from externals. And what other art is there that is acquired by guise and hair-dress, and does not have also principles, and subject-matter, and end? What, then, is subject-matter
	for the philosopher? It is not a rough cloak, is it? No, but reason. What is end for the philosopher? It is not to wear a rough cloak, is it? No, but to keep his reason right. What is the nature of his principles? They do not have to do with the question how to grow a long beard, or a thick head of hair, do they? Nay, rather, as Zeno says, to understand the elements of reason, what the nature of each one is, and how they are fitted one to another, and all the consequences of these facts. Will you not, therefore, observe first of all whether the philosopher fulfils his profession by misbehaving,

	and then, if that be the case, blame his way of acting? But as it is, when you yourself are behaving decently, you say, on the basis of the evil that he seems to you to be doing, “Look at the philosopher,” just as though it were proper to call a man who acts like that a philosopher; and again, “Is that what a philosopher is?” But you do not say, “Look at the carpenter,” when you know that a man is an adulterer, or see a man eating greedily, nor do you say, under similar circumstances, “Look at the musician.” Thus to a certain degree you too realize what the philosophers profession is, but you backslide and get confused through carelessness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But even those who are styled philosophers pursue their calling with means which are sometimes good and sometimes bad. For example, when they have taken a rough cloak and let their beards grow, they say, “I am a philosopher.” But nobody will say, “I am a musician,” if he buys a plectrum and a cithara; nor, “I am a smith,” if he puts on a felt cap and an apron; but the guise is fitted to the art, and they get their name from the art, but not from the guise. That is why Euphrates[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] was right when he used to say: “For a long time I tried not to let people know that I was a philosopher, and this,” he says, “was useful to me. For, in the first place, I knew that whatever I did well, I did so, not on account of the spectators, but on my own account; it was for my own sake that I ate well, and kept my countenance

	and gait composed; it was all for myself and for God. And, secondly, as the contest was mine alone, so also I alone ran the risks; in no respect through me, if I did what was disgraceful or unseemly, did the cause of philosophy come into danger, nor did I do harm to the multitude by going wrong as a philosopher. For that reason those who were ignorant of my purpose wondered how it was that, although I was familiar with all the philosophers and lived with them, I was myself not acting in the role of a philosopher. And what harm was there in having the philosopher that I was, recognized by what I did, rather than by the outward signs?

	See how I eat, how drink, how sleep, how endure, how refrain, how help, how employ desire and how aversion, how I observe my relationships, whether they be natural or acquired, without confusion and without hindrance; judge me on the basis of all this, if you know how. But if you are so deaf and blind as not to regard even Hephaestus as a good smith unless you see the felt cap resting on his head, what harm can come from passing unrecognized by a judge so foolish?

In the field where there was hurt and help. “If,” says he, “a man can hurt me, what I am engaged in amounts to nothing; if I wait for somebody else to help me, I am myself nothing. If I want something and it does not happen, it follows that I am miserable.” This was the mighty ring[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] to which he challenged every man whomsoever, and therein he would not, I believe, have given way before anyone in—what do you suppose?—in proclaiming and asserting “I am such and such a man”?

	with him. Man, take a winter’s training first;[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] look at your own choice, for fear it is like that of a dyspeptic, or a woman with the strange cravings of pregnancy. Practise first not to let men know who you are; keep your philosophy to yourself a little while. That is the way fruit is produced: the seed has to be buried and hidden for a season, and be grown by slow degrees, in order that it may come to perfection. But if it heads out before it produces the jointed stock, it never matures, it is from a garden of Adonis.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] That is the kind of plant you are too; you have blossomed prematurely, and the winter will blight you utterly. See what the farmers say about their seeds, when the hot weather comes before its proper time. They are in utmost anxiety lest the seeds should grow insolently lush, and then but a single frost should lay hold of them and expose their weakness. Man, do you also beware; you have grown insolently lush, you have leaped forward to occupy some petty reputation before its due time; you think yourself somebody, fool that you are among fools; you will be bitten by the frost, or rather, you have already been bitten by the frost, down at the root, while your upper part still blooms a little, and for that reason you seem to be still alive and flourishing.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Allow [c dimgray]us[/c] at least to ripen as nature wishes.

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]Early spring house-gardens in honour of Adonis, where
	seeds were thickly planted in porous earthenware, sponges,
	and the like, sprouting luxuriantly, and of course quickly
	fading (cf. the reference to them in Isaiah, 1. 29: “Ye shall
	be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.”) The
	expression became proverbial for incompleteness and early
	fading.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]This metaphor is so preposterous, for it is always the
	extremities of plants which are the first to be frostbitten, and
	not the protected roots, that one is inclined to ask if the text be sound. Clearly it is, since a whole series of corrections would have to be made in order to avoid the difficulty. Epictetus, a city dweller, probably knew little directly about the effects of frost on garden plants. The words “flower,” “tree,” and “herb” do not occur in his conversations at all, and even “plant” but rarely.—See note on IV. 11, 1.

Why, a bull is not ignorant of his own nature and equipment, when some wild beast appears, nor does he hang back for someone to encourage him; neither does a dog, when he sees some wild animal; and shall I, if I have the equipment of a good man, hang back, so that you may encourage me to do what is my own proper work?

	Whenever you see another person holding office, set over against this the fact that you possess the ability to get along without office; whenever you see another person wealthy, see what you have instead. For if you have nothing instead, you are wretched; but if you are capable of feeling no need of wealth, know that you are better off, and have something worth far more than wealth. Another has a comely wife, you the ability not to yearn for a comely wife. Is all this small in your eyes? Yet how much would these men give, who are rich and hold office, and live with beautiful women, to be able to despise wealth and offices, and these very same women whom they

	passionately love and win? Do you not know what kind of thing the thirst of a man in fever is? It is quite unlike that of a man in health. The latter drinks and his thirst is gone, but the other gets a momentary satisfaction, and then becomes nauseated, turns the water into bile, throws up, has a pain in his bowels, and suffers more violent thirst than before. A similar thing it is to be rich and have strong desire, to hold office and have strong desire, to sleep by the side of a beautiful woman and have strong desire; jealousy is added to one’s lot, fear of loss, disgraceful words, disgraceful thoughts, unseemly deeds.

Instead of Socrates and Diogenes you have come to admire the man who is able to corrupt and seduce the largest number of women. You wish to be handsome and make yourself up, though you are not handsome, and you wish to make a show of gay attire, so as to attract the women, and you think yourself blessed if perchance you light upon some trivial perfume. But formerly you used never even to think of any of these things, but only where you might find decent speech, a worthy man, a noble thought. Therefore you used to sleep as a man, to go forth as a man, to wear the clothes of a man, to utter the discourse that was suitable for a good man; and after all that do

	you still say, “I have lost nothing”? And is it nothing but small change that men lose in this way? Is not self-respect lost, is not decency lost? Or is it impossible that the loss of these things counts for anything? To you, indeed, the loss of none of these things, perhaps, seems any longer serious; but there once was a time when you thought it the only serious loss and harm, when you were in great anxiety lest anyone should dislodge you from these good words and deeds.

	Behold, you [c dimgray]have[/c] been dislodged, though by no one else but yourself. Fight against yourself, vindicate yourself for decency, for respect, for freedom. If anyone ever told you about me that someone was forcing me to commit adultery, to wear clothes like yours, or to perfume myself, would you not have gone and murdered the man who was so maltreating me? And now, therefore, are you not willing to come to your own rescue? Yet how much easier is the work of rescue in the latter case! It is not necessary to kill somebody, put him in bonds, or assault him; you do not have to come out into the market-place, but only to talk to yourself, the man most likely to be persuaded, to whom no one is more persuasive than yourself. And first of all condemn what you are doing; then, when you have passed your condemnation, do not despair of yourself, nor act like the spiritless people who, when once they have given in, surrender themselves completely, and are swept off by the current, as it were, but learn how the gymnastic trainer of boys acts.

	Men find all their difficulties in externals, their perplexities in externals. “What shall I do? How is it to take place? How is it to turn out? I am afraid that this will befall me, or that.” All these are the expressions of men who concern themselves with the things that lie outside the sphere of the moral purpose. For who says, “How am I to avoid giving assent to the false? How am I to refuse to swerve aside from the true?”? If a man is so gifted by nature as to be in great anxiety about these things, I shall remind him, “Why are you in great anxiety? It is under your own control; rest secure. Do not be in a hurry to give your assent before applying the rule of nature.”

	Again, if a man is in great anxiety about desire, for fear lest it become incomplete and miss its mark, or about aversion, for fear lest it fall into what it would avoid, I shall first give him a kiss of congratulation, because he has got rid of what the rest of mankind are excited about, and their fears, and has turned his serious thought to his own true business in the realm where he himself is. And after that I shall say to him,” If you do not wish to desire without failing to get, or to avoid without falling into the object of your aversion, desire none of those things which are not your own, and avoid none of those things which are not under your control. If not, you are of necessity bound to fail in achieving your desires, and to fall into what you would avoid.” Where is there any difficulty in that case? What room is there to ask, “How is it to take place?” and “How is it to turn out?” and to say, “I am afraid that this will befall me, or that”?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Is not the future outside the sphere of the moral purpose now?—Yes.—And is not the true nature of the good and evil inside the sphere of the moral purpose?—Yes.—Are you permitted, then, to make a natural use of every outcome? No one can prevent you, can he?—No one.—Therefore, say no longer to me, “How is it to take place?” Because, whatever takes place, you will turn it to good purpose, and the outcome will be a blessing for you. Or what would Heracles have been had he said “How am I to prevent a great lion from appearing, or a great boar, or savage men?”? And what do you care for that? If a great boar appears, the struggle in which you are to engage will be greater; if evil men appear, you will clear the world of evil men.—But

	if I die in so doing?—You will die as a good man, bringing to fulfilment a noble action. Why, since you have to die in any event, you must be found doing something or other—farming, or digging, or engaged in commerce, or holding a consulship, or suffering with dyspepsia or dysentery. What is it, then, you wish to be doing when death finds you? I for my part should wish it to be some work that befits a man, something beneficent, that promotes the common welfare, or is noble. But if I cannot be found doing such great things as these, I should like at least to be engaged upon that which is free from hindrance, that which is given me to to do, and that is, correcting myself, as I strive to perfect the faculty which deals with the external impressions, labouring to achieve calm, while yet giving to each of my human relationships its due; and, if I am so fortunate, striving to attain to the third field of study,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] that which has to do with security in the formation of judgements.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If death finds me occupied with these matters, it is enough for me if I can lift up my hands unto God, and say,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] “The faculties which I received from Thee to enable me to understand Thy governance and to follow it, these I have not neglected; I have not dishonoured Thee as far as in me lay. Behold how I have dealt with my senses, behold how I have dealt with my preconceptions. Have I ever blamed Thee? Have I been discontented with any of these things which happen, or wished it to have been otherwise? Have I at all violated my

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]These imaginary last words of Epictetus have given much
	offence to Elizabeth Carter (author of the most famous
	of the English translations), and no doubt others, who find
	them ostentatious and lacking in humility. They represent,
	however, an ideal and not an actual condition, and as such are
	entirely innocent. Epictetus, who was in fact the most humble of men (see Vol. I. pp. xviii–xx), does not say, “It is enough for me [c dimgray]because[/c] I can lift up my hands unto God, and say,” but, “[c dimgray]if[/c] I can,” which is a very different matter.

Take them back again and assign them to what place Thou wilt, for they were all Thine, and Thou gavest them me.” Is it not enough for a man to take his departure from the world in this state of mind?

	But that this may take place a man must accept no small troubles, and must miss no small things. You cannot wish for a consulship and at the same time wish for this; you cannot have set your heart upon having lands and this too; you cannot at the same time be solicitous for your paltry slaves and yourself too. But if you wish for any one of the things that are not your own, what is your own is lost. This is the nature of the matter: Nothing is done except for a price. And why be surprised? If you wish to be consul you must keep vigils, run around, kiss men’s hands, rot away at other men’s doors, say and do many slavish things, send presents to many persons, and guest-gifts to some people every day. And what is the outcome of it all?

But if something that belongs to you be lost while you are engaged in these affairs, or be spent to no purpose, or someone else get what you ought to have got, are you going to be vexed immediately at what has happened? Will you not balance off what you are getting in return for what, how much in return for how much? Nay, do you wish to get such valuable things for nothing?

	You cannot be continually giving attention to both externals and your own governing principle. But if you want the former, let the latter go; otherwise you will have neither the latter nor the former, being drawn in both directions. If you want the latter, you must let the former go. The oil will be spilled, my paltry furniture will perish, but I shall be calm. There will be a fire when I am not at home, and my books will perish, yet I shall deal with my external impressions according to nature. But I shall have nothing to eat. If I am so badly off as all that, death is my harbour. And this is the harbour of all men, even death, and this their refuge. That is why no one of the things that befall us in our life is difficult.

	being.” And again, if one finds fault with some beast, we are in the habit of saying immediately, as though in apology, “Well, of course it isn’t a human being.” So true it is that we consider cleanliness to be a special characteristic of man, deriving it in the first instance from the gods. For since they are by nature pure[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and undefined, in so far as men have approached them by virtue of reason, just so far are they attached to purity and cleanliness. But since it is impossible for the nature of men to be altogether pure, seeing that it is composed of such material as it is, the reason which they have received from the gods endeavours to render this material clean as far as is possible.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Therefore, the prime and highest purity is that which appears in the soul, and the same is true of impurity. But you would not find the same impurity in a soul as you would in a body, and as being soul, what else would you find impure about it than that which makes it dirty for the performance of its own functions? And the functions of a soul are the exercise of choice, of refusal, of desire, of aversion, of preparation, of purpose, and of assent. What, then, can that be which makes the soul dirty and unclean in these functions? Nothing but its erroneous decisions. It follows, therefore, that impurity of a soul consists of bad judgements, and purification consists in creating within it the proper kind of judgements; and a pure soul is the one which has the proper kind of judgements, for this is the only soul which is secure against confusion and pollution in its own functions.

	as may be, something similar to this in the case of the body also. It was impossible that there should be no discharge of mucus from the nose, since man’s body has been composed as it is; for that reason nature made hands, and the nostrils like tubes to discharge the humours. If, therefore, a man snuffs back these discharges of mucus, I say that he is not acting as a human being should. It was impossible that the feet should not get muddy, nor dirty at all, when they pass through certain such substances; for that reason nature has provided water, for that hands. It was impossible that some impurity from eating should not remain on the teeth; for that reason nature says, “Wash your teeth.” Why? In order that you may be a human being, and not a beast or a pig. It was impossible that something dirty and needing to be cleaned off should not be left on the person from our sweat and the pressure of our clothes; for that reason we have water, oil, hands, a towel, a strigil,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] nitre, and, on occasion, every other kind of equipment to cleanse the body.

It is interesting to see how Epictetus, simple and austere as he was, vigorously maintained the validity of older Greek and Roman feeling in this regard.

If nature had committed to your care a horse, would you have utterly neglected it? And now I would have you think that your body has been entrusted to you like a horse; wash it, rub it down, make it so that nobody will turn his back on you or move aside. But who does not avoid a dirty fellow that smells and has an unsightly skin, even more than a man bespattered with dung? In this latter case the smell is external and acquired, in the other it comes from slovenliness that is internal, and is characteristic of one who has grown rotten through and through.

	The pallid men I mean, who shoeless go.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]—
	Oh, yes, but then he says also that Socrates “trod the air,” and stole people’s clothes from the wrestling school.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] And yet all who have written about Socrates unite in bearing testimony to the precise opposite of this; that he was not merely pleasant to hear, but also to see. Again, men write the same thing about Diogenes. For a man ought not to drive away the multitude from philosophy, even by the appearance of his body, but as in everything else, so also on the side of the body, he ought to show himself cheerful and free from perturbation. “See, O men, that I [c dimgray]have[/c] nothing, and [c dimgray]need[/c] nothing. See how, although I am without a house, and without a city, and an exile, if it so chance, and without a hearth, I still live a life more tranquil and serene than that of all the noble and the rich. Yes, and you see that even my paltry body is not disfigured by my hard way of living.” But if I am told this by a person who has the bearing and face of a condemned man, what one of all the gods shall persuade me to approach philosophy, if she makes people like that? Far be it from me! I shouldn’t be willing to do so, not even if it would make me a wise man.

	cleaning clothes, as in a laundry, which was generally done in ancient Greece, as in modern, and in the Orient, with cold water. All that is meant, as far as Socrates is concerned, is that he generally washed at home in cold water, and very seldom used public baths or hot baths.

	As for me, by the gods, I should rather have the young man who was experiencing the first stirrings towards philosophy come to me with his hair carefully dressed, than with it in a state of desperate neglect and dirty. For the first case shows that there exists in the young man a sort of imaging of beauty, and an aiming at comeliness, and where he fancies it to be, there also he devotes his efforts. With that as a starting-point, all that it is necessary to do is to show him the way, and say, “Young man, you are seeking the beautiful, and you do well. Know, then, that it arises in that part of you where you have your reason; seek it there where you have your choices and your refusals, where you have your desires and your aversions. For this part is something of a special kind which you have within you, but your paltry body is by nature only clay. Why do you toil for it to no purpose? If you learn nothing else, time at least will teach you that it is nothing.” But if he comes to me bespattered with dung, dirty, his moustache reaching down to his knees, what have I to say to him, from what point of resemblance can I start so as to prevail upon him? For what is there to which he is devoted, that bears any resemblance to the beautiful, so that I may turn him about and say, “Beauty is not there, but here”? Do you want me to say to him, “Beauty does not consist in being bespattered with dung, but in reason”? For is he aiming at beauty? Has he any manifestation of it? Go and talk to a pig, that he may wallow no more in mud! That is why the words of Xenocrates laid hold even of a Polemo,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] because he was a young man who loved beauty. For he came to Xenocrates with glimmerings of a zeal for the beautiful, but was looking for it in the wrong place.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	Why, look you, nature has not made dirty even the animals which associate with man. A horse doesn’t roll around in the mud, does he? or a highly bred dog? No, but the hog, and the miserable rotten geese, and worms, and spiders, the creatures farthest removed from association with human beings. Do you, then, who are a human being, wish to be not even an animal of the kind that associates with men, but rather a worm, or a spider?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Will you not take a bath somewhere, some time, in any form you please? Will you not wash yourself? If you don’t care to bathe in hot water, then use cold. Will you not come to us clean, that your companions may be glad? What, and do you in such a state go with us even into the temples, where it is forbidden by custom to spit or blow the nose, yourself being nothing but a mass of spit and drivel?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Well, what then? Is anyone demanding that you beautify yourself? Heaven forbid! except you beautify that which is our true nature[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]—the reason, its judgements, its activities; but your body only so far as to keep it cleanly, only so far as to avoid giving offence. But if you hear that one ought not to wear scarlet, go bespatter your rough cloak with dung—or tear it to pieces![c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Yet where am I to get a rough cloak that looks well?—Man, you have water, wash it! See, here is a lovable young man, here an elderly man worthy to love and to be loved in return, to whom a person will entrust the education of his son, to whom daughters and young men will come, if it

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Of course a spider is not ordinarily a dirty animal in its

	frequently found in quiet and hence dusty spots. Cf. note
	on § 1.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i.e.[/c] a man really [c dimgray]is[/c] not body, which he has in common with other animals, but mind, reason, or moral purpose. Cf. such passages as I. 1. 23; III. 1, 25–6; 13, 17; IV. 5, 12 and 23; 7, 31 f.; and § 27 above.

	[b][c dimgray]Of attention[/c][/b]
	When you relax your attention for a little while, do not imagine that whenever you choose you will recover it, but bear this in mind, that because of the mistake which you have made to-day, your condition must necessarily be worse as regards everything else. For, to begin with—and this is the worst of all—a habit of not paying attention is developed; and after that a habit of deferring attention; and always you grow accustomed to putting off from one time to another tranquil and appropriate living, the life in accordance with nature, and persistence in that life. Now if the postponement of such matters is profitable, it is still more profitable to abandon them altogether; but if it is not profitable, why do you not maintain your attention continuously? “To-day I want to play.” What is to prevent your playing, then,—but with attention? “I want to sing.” What is to prevent your singing, then,—but with attention? There is no part of the activities of your life excepted, to which attention does not extend, is there? What, will you do it worse by attention, and better by inattention? And yet what other thing, of all that go to make up our life, is done better by those who are inattentive? Does the inattentive carpenter do his work more accurately?

	The inattentive helmsman steer more safely? And is there any other of the lesser functions of life which is done better by inattention? Do you not realize that when once you let your mind go wandering, it is no longer within your power to recall it, to bring it to bear upon either seemliness, or self-respect, or moderation? But you do anything that comes into your head, you follow your inclinations.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What are the things, then, to which I ought to pay attention?—First, these general principles, and you ought to have them at your command, and without them neither go to sleep, nor rise up, nor drink, nor eat, nor mingle with men; I mean the following: No man is master of another’s moral purpose; and: In its sphere alone are to be found one’s good and evil. It follows, therefore, that no one has power either to procure me good, or to involve me in evil, but I myself alone have authority over myself in these matters. Accordingly, when these things are secure for me, what excuse have I for being disturbed about things external? What kind of tyrant inspires fear, what kind of disease, or poverty, or obstacle?—But I have not pleased So-and-so.—He is not my function, is he? He is not my judgement, is he?—No.—Why, then, do I care any longer?—But he has the reputation of being somebody.—He and those who think so highly of him will have to see to that, but I have one whom I must please, to whom I must submit, whom I must obey, that is, God, and after Him, myself.

	First, therefore, we ought to have these principles at command, and to do nothing apart from them, but keep the soul intent upon this mark; we must pursue none of the things external, none of the things which are not our own, but as He that is mighty has ordained; pursuing without any hesitation the things that lie within the sphere of the moral purpose, and all other things as they have been given us. And next we must remember who we are, and what is our designation, and must endeavour to direct our actions, in the performance of our duties, to meet the possibilities of our social relations. We must remember what is the proper time for song, the proper time for play, and in whose presence; also what will be out of place; lest our companions despise us, and we despise ourselves; when to jest, and whom to laugh at, and to what end to engage in social intercourse, and with whom; and, finally, how to maintain one’s proper character in such social intercourse. But whenever you deviate from any one of these principles, immediately you suffer loss, and that not from anywhere outside, but from the very nature of the activity.

	What then? Is it possible to be free from fault altogether? No, that cannot be achieved, but it is possible ever to be intent upon avoiding faults. For we must be satisfied, if we succeed in escaping at least a few faults by never relaxing our attention. But now, when you say, “To-morrow I will pay attention,” I would have you know that this is what you are saying: “To-day I will be shameless, tactless, abject; it will be in the power of other men to grieve me; I will get angry to-day, I will give way to envy.” Just see all the evils that you are allowing yourself! But if it is good for you to pay attention to-morrow, how much better is it to-day! If it is to your interest to-morrow, it is much more so to-day, that you may be able to do the same to-morrow also, and not put it off again, this time to the day after to-morrow.

	[b][c dimgray]To those who lightly talk about their own affairs[/c][/b]
	When someone gives us the impression of having talked to us frankly about his personal affairs, somehow or other we are likewise led to tell him our own secrets, and to think that is frankness! The first reason for this is because it seems unfair for a man to have heard his neighbour’s affairs, and yet not to let him too have, in his turn, a share in ours. Another reason, after that, is because we feel that we shall not give the impression to these men of being frank, if we keep our own private affairs concealed. Indeed, men are frequently in the habit of saying, “ I have told you everything

	about myself, aren’t you willing to tell me anything about yourself? Where do people act like that?” Furthermore, there is also the thought that we can safely trust the man who has already entrusted knowledge of his own affairs; for the idea occurs to us that this man would never spread abroad knowledge of our affairs, because he would be careful to guard against our too spreading abroad knowledge of his affairs. In this fashion the rash are ensnared by the soldiers in Rome. A soldier, dressed like a civilian, sits down by your side, and begins to speak ill of Caesar, and then you too, just as though you had received from him some guarantee of good faith in the fact that he began the abuse, tell likewise everything you think, and the next thing is—you are led off to prison in chains.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] We experience something of the same sort also in the general course of our life. For even though this particular man has safely entrusted knowledge of his own affairs to me, I do not myself in like manner tell my affairs to any chance comer; no, I listen and keep still, if, to be sure, I happen to be that kind of a person, but he goes out and tells everybody. And then, when I find out what has happened, if I myself resemble the other person, because I want to get even with him I tell about his affairs, and confound him and am myself confounded. If, however, I remember that one person does not harm another, but that it is a man’s own actions which both harm and help him, this much I achieve, namely, that I do not act like the other person, but despite that I get into the state in which I am because of my own foolish talking.

You did not tell about your affairs on certain conditions, that you were to hear about mine in return, did you? If you are a babbler, and think that every person you meet is a friend, do you also want me to be like yourself? And why, if you did well to entrust your affairs to me, but it is impossible for me to do well in trusting you, do you wish me to be rash? It is just as though I had a jar that was sound, and you one with a hole in it, and you came to me and deposited your wine with me, for me to store it in my jar; and then you complained because I do not entrust to you my wine also; why, [c dimgray]your[/c] jar has a hole in it! How, then, is equality any longer to be found? You made your deposit with a faithful man, with a respectful man, with a man who regards only his own activities as either harmful or helpful, and nothing that is external. Do you wish me to make a deposit with you—a man who has dishonoured his own moral purpose, and wants to get paltry cash, or some office, or advancement at court, even if you are going to cut the throats of your children, as Medea did? Where is there equality in that? Nay, show yourself to me as a faithful, respectful, dependable man; show that your judgements are those of a friend, show that your vessel has no hole in it, and you shall see how I will not wait for you to entrust the knowledge of your affairs to me, but I will go of myself and ask you to hear about mine.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Yes, but I trust you, while you do not trust me.—First,
	you do not trust me, either, but you are a babbler, and that is the reason why you cannot keep anything back. Why, look you, if that statement of yours is true, entrust these matters to me alone; but the fact is that whenever you see anybody at leisure you sit down beside him and say, “Brother, I have no one more kindly disposed or dearer to me than you, I ask you to listen to my affairs”; and you act this way to people whom you have not known for even a short time. And even if you do trust me, it is clear you trust me as a faithful and respectful person, not because I have already told you about my affairs. Allow me also, then, to have the same thought about you. Show me that, if a man unbosoms himself to somebody about his own affairs, he is faithful and respectful. For if that were so, I should have gone about and told my own affairs to all men, that is, if that was going to make me faithful and respectful. But that is not the case; to be faithful and respectful a man needs judgements of no casual sort. If, therefore, you see someone very much in earnest about the things that lie outside the province of his moral purpose, and subordinating his own moral purpose to them, rest assured that this man has tens of thousands of persons who subject him to compulsion and hinder him. He has no need of pitch or the wheel[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] to get him to speak out what he knows, but a little nod from a wench, if it so happen, will upset him, a kindness from one of those who frequent Caesar’s court, desire for office, or an inheritance, and thirty thousand

	[b][c dimgray]Introductory Note[/c][/b]
	The genuine fragments of Epictetus are not very numerous, and since several of them are of unusual interest, it has seemed best to add them at this point. One fragment, No. 28 b, I have added to those listed by Schenkl, since its discovery was subsequent to his latest edition.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Earlier editions have included a large number of aphorisms gathered from Stobaeus, and from a gnomology purporting to contain excerpts from Democritus, Isocrates, and Epictetus. The researches of a group of scholars, principally H. Schenkl,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] R. Asmus,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and A. Elter,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] have thrown such doubt upon the authenticity of these aphorisms that it would scarcely serve any useful purpose to reproduce them in the present work.

Is it not enough to learn the true nature of the good and the evil, and the limits of the desires and aversions, and also of the choices and refusals, and, by employing these as rules, to order the affairs of our life, and dismiss the things that are beyond us? It may very well be that these latter are not to be comprehended by the human mind, and even if one assume that they are perfectly comprehensible, well, what profit comes from comprehending them? And ought we not to say that those men trouble themselves in vain who assign all this as necessary to the philosopher’s system of thought? Is, therefore, also the precept at Delphi superfluous, “Know thyself”?—That, indeed, no, the man answers.—What, then, does it mean? If one bade a singer in a chorus to “know himself,” would he not heed the order by paying attention both to his fellows in the chorus and to singing in harmony with them?—Yes.—And so in the case of a sailor?

	Of things that are, God has put some under our control, and others not under our control. Under our control He put the finest and most important matter, that, indeed, by virtue of which He Himself is happy, the power to make use of external impressions. For when this power has its perfect work, it is freedom, serenity, cheerfulness, steadfastness; it is also justice, and law, and self-control, and the sum and substance of virtue. But all other things He has not put under our control. Therefore we also ought to become of one mind with God, and, dividing matters in this way, lay hold in every way we can upon the things that are under our control, but what is not under our control we ought to leave to the Cosmos, and gladly resign to it whatever it needs, be that our children, our country, our body, or anything whatsoever.

	Such was, and is, and will be, the nature of the universe, and it is not possible for the things that come into being to come into being otherwise than they now do. And not only has mankind participated in this process of change and transformation, and all the other living beings upon earth, but also those which are divine, and, by Zeus, even the four elements, which are changed and transformed upwards and downwards,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] as earth becomes water, and water air, and air again is transformed into ether; and there is the same kind of transformation also downwards. If a man endeavours to incline his mind to these things, and to persuade himself to accept of his own accord what needs must befall him, he will have a very reasonable and harmonious life.

	[c dimgray]I have heard Favorinus say that he had heard the philosopher Epictetus say,[/c] that most of those who gave the appearance of philosophizing were philosophers of this kind: ἄνευ τοῦ πράττειν, μέχρι τοῦ λέγειν[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] ([c dimgray]this means, “apart from deeds, as far as words”[/c]). [c dimgray]There is a still more vigorous expression which he was accustomed to use, that Arrian has recorded in the books which he wrote about his discourses For Arrian says that[/c] when Epictetus had noticed a man lost to shame, of misdirected energy, and evil habits, bold, impudent in speech, and concerned with everything else but his soul, when he saw a man of that kind, [c dimgray]continues Arrian,[/c] handling also the studies and pursuits of philosophy, and taking up physics, and studying dialectics, and taking up and investigating many a theoretical principle of this sort, he would call upon gods and men, and frequently, in the midst of that appeal, he would denounce the man in these words: “Ἄνθρωπε, ποῦ βάλλεις; σκέψαι, εἰ κεκάθαρται τὸ ἀγγεῖον. ἂν γὰρ εἰς τὴν οἴησιν αὐτὰ βάλῃς, ἀπώλετο· ἢν σαπῇ, οὖρον ἢ ὄξος ἐγένετο ἢ εἴ τι τούτων χεῖρον.

	At Rome the women have in their hands Plato’s [c dimgray]Republic,[/c] because he insists on community of women. For they pay attention only to the words, and not to the meaning of the man; the fact is, he does not bid people marry and live together, one man with one woman, and then go on to advocate the community of women, but he first abolishes that kind of marriage altogether, and introduces another kind in its place.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And in general people delight in finding excuses for their own faults; for, indeed, philosophy says we ought not to stretch out even our finger at random![c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	[b][c dimgray]From the[/c] Memorabilia [c dimgray]of Epictetus[/c][/b]
	One ought to know that it is not easy for a man to acquire a fixed judgement, unless he should day by day state and hear the same principles, and at the same time apply them to his life.

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The community of women which Plato proposed was,
	first of all, restricted to a small, highly-trained, and devoted
	band of warrior-saints; and, second, such that no man and
	woman should pair off for more than a very temporary “marriage,”
	all such matings being carefully supervised by the
	highest authorities. Instead of being more licentious than ordinary monogamous marriage (which frequently deserves Bernard Shaw’s jibe, that it is popular largely because it combines the maximum of temptation with the maximum of opportunity), Plato’s proposal was relatively a denial of the flesh, and a marked move towards asceticism.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]See II. 11, 17. The remark in this connection is no doubt ironical, mockingly justifying the process of “rationalization “just described.

	For this reason it is right to praise Agrippinus,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] because, although he was a man of the very highest worth, he never praised himself, but used to blush even if someone else praised him. His character was such, said Epictetus, that when any hardship befell him he would compose a eulogy upon it; on fever, if he had a fever; on disrepute, if he suffered from disrepute; on exile, if he went into exile. And once, he said, when Agrippinus was preparing to take lunch, a man brought him word that Nero ordered him into exile; “Very well,” said he, “we shall take our lunch in Aricia.”[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	When Agrippinus was governor,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] he used to try to persuade the persons whom he sentenced that it was proper for them to be sentenced. “For,” he would say, “it is not as an enemy or as a brigand that I record my vote against them, but as a curator and guardian; just as also the physician encourages the man upon whom he is operating, and persuades him to submit to the operation.”

	Nature is wonderful, and, as Xenophon[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] says, “fond of her creatures.” At all events we love and tend our body, the most unpleasant and dirtiest thing that there is; why, if we had had to tend our neighbour’s body for no more than five days, we could not have endured it. Just consider what a nuisance it is to get up in the morning and brush some other person’s teeth, and then after attending to a call of nature to wash those parts. Truly it is wonderful to love a thing for which we perform so many services every day. I stuff this bag here;[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and then I empty it; what is more tiresome? But I must serve God. For that reason I remain, and endure to wash this miserable paltry body, and to

Why, then, when Nature, which gave us our body, takes it away, do you not bear it?—I love it, says somebody.—Well, but as I was just now saying, is it not Nature that has given you this very affection?

People are very strange, he used to say, wishing neither to live nor to die.

	We must discover, said he, an art that deals with assent, and in the sphere of the choices we must be careful to maintain close attention, that they be made with due reservations, that they be social, and that they be according to merit; and from desire we must refrain altogether, and must exercise aversion towards none of the things that are not under our control.

Why, then, count the former aspect of the matter a misfortune, rather than this latter good fortune? And in general do you call a man’s misfortune that which is not an aberration from man’s nature? And does that seem to you to be an aberration from the nature of man which does not contravene the will of his nature? What then? This will of man’s nature you have already learned; this, then, which has befallen you does not prevent you, does it, from being just, high-minded, self-controlled, self-possessed, deliberate, free from deceit, self-respecting, free, and everything else, the possession of which enables the nature of man to come into its own?

	[b]The [c dimgray]Encheiridion[/c], or [c dimgray]Manual[/c][/b]
	This celebrated work is a compilation made by Arrian himself from the [c dimgray]Discourses[/c], and the great majority of those who know Epictetus at all have come to do so from this little book alone. That is a pity, because the necessary aridity and formalism of such a systematization obscure the more modesty human, and sympathetic aspects of the great teacher’s character. Most of the unfavourable criticism which has been passed upon Epictetus—and
	there is some of this, although not much—is clearly based upon the occasionally somewhat inadequate impressions which any compendium must produce. For it may be doubted whether even so noble a statement as the Apostles’ Creed has ever made a single convert.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Occasionally Arrian has modified to a slight degree the form of statement, as we may observe from the numerous instances, amounting to somewhat more than half of the book, where material from the first four books of the [c dimgray]Discourses[/c] has been employed; but the substance seems to have been faithfully preserved, wherever it is possible to follow his procedure in detail.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The separate editions and translations of the [c dimgray]Encheiridion[/c][c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] are extremely numerous. Few, however,

	have been of any notable value, except, perhaps, the celebrated translations by Politian and Leopardi, and Schweighäuser’s separate edition of 1798,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] which is still the last independent critical text,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and has been reprinted by most subsequent editors, even Schenkl, although the latter has added much useful critical material in his notes, especially those which indicate the probable sources of such passages as seem to be derived from the four books of the [c dimgray]Discourses[/c], and in particular has arranged the [c dimgray]apparatus criticus[/c] in more convenient terms.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The [c dimgray]sigla[/c] which Schenkl has devised for Schweighäuser’s
	apparatus, and which may occasionally be employed below, are the following:

	<ul class="simple">
	<li>A MSS. in which portions of the [c dimgray]Encheiridion[/c] precede the corresponding commentary of Simplicius.
	<li>V The ed. of 1528.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]For some unknown reason Schweighäuser in his [c dimgray]Epicteteae Philosophiae Monumenta[/c], III. 1799, reproduced Upton’s much less satisfactory text.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]One reason for this delay is the extremely large number of MSS. involved, not merely of the work itself, but of the two Christian paraphrases and of the huge commentary by Simplicius, which is more than ten times the bulk of the original. The texts of these must first be critically determined before their value for the [c dimgray]Encheiridion[/c] can be estimated, so that in reality four works instead of one have to be edited from the very foundations. Another is the very slight probability that any really notable contributions to knowledge might result therefrom. As an intellectual problem the preparation of a new edition of the [c dimgray]Encheiridion[/c] presents certain interesting features, but as a practical undertaking it is outranked by a good many other possible investigations.

	[b]The [c dimgray]Encheiridion[/c] of Epictetus[/b]

	1. Some things are under our control, while others are not under our control. Under our control are conception, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything that is our own doing; not under our control are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, everything that is not our own doing. Furthermore, the things under our control are by nature free, unhindered, and unimpeded; while the things not under our control are weak, servile, subject to hindrance, and not our own. Remember, therefore, that if what is naturally slavish you think to be free, and what is not your own to be your own, you will be hampered, will grieve, will be in turmoil, and will blame both gods and men; while if you think only what is your own to be your own, and what is not your own to be, as it really is, not your own, then no one will ever be able to exert compulsion upon you, no one will hinder you, you will blame no one, will find fault with no one, will do absolutely nothing against your will, you will have no personal enemy, no one will harm you, for neither is there any harm that can touch you.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With such high aims, therefore, remember that you must bestir yourself with no slight effort to lay hold of them, but you will have to give up some

	things entirely, and defer others for the time being. But if you wish for these things also, and at the same time for both office and wealth, it may be that you will not get even these latter, because you aim also at the former, and certainly you will fail to get the former, which alone bring freedom and happiness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Make it, therefore, your study at the very outset to say to every harsh external impression, “You are an external impression and not at all what you appear to be.” After that examine it and test it by these rules which you have, the first and most important of which is this: Whether the impression has to do with the things which are under our control, or with those which are not under our control; and, if it has to do with some one of the things not under our control, have ready to hand the answer, “It is nothing to me,”

	2. Remember that the promise of desire is the attainment of what you desire, that of aversion is not to fall into what is avoided, and that he who fails in his desire is unfortunate, while he who falls into what he would avoid experiences misfortune. If, then, you avoid only what is unnatural among those things which are under your control, you will fall into none of the things which you avoid; but if you try to avoid disease, or death, or poverty, you will experience misfortune. Withdraw, therefore, your aversion from all the matters that are not under our control, and transfer it to what is unnatural among those which are under our control. But for the time being[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] remove utterly your desire; for if you desire some one of the things that are not under our control you are bound to be unfortunate; and, at the

	same time, not one of the things that are under our control, which it would be excellent for you to desire., is within your grasp. But employ only choice and refusal, and these too but lightly, and with reservations,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and without straining.

	3. With everything which entertains you, is useful, or of which you are fond, remember to say to yourself, beginning with the very least things, “What is its nature?” If you are fond of a jug, say, “I am fond of a jug”; for when it is broken you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your own child or wife, say to yourself that you are kissing a human being; for when it dies you will not be disturbed.

	4. When you are on the point of putting your hand to some undertaking, remind yourself what the nature of that undertaking is. If you are going out of the house to bathe, put before your mind what happens at a public bath—those who splash you with water, those who jostle against you, those who vilify you and rob you. And thus you will set about your undertaking more securely if at the outset you say to yourself, “I want to take a bath, and, at the same time, to keep my moral purpose in harmony with nature.” And so do in every undertaking. For thus, if anything happens to hinder you in your bathing, you will be ready to say, “Oh, well, this was not the only thing that I wanted, but I wanted also to keep my moral purpose in harmony with nature; and I shall not so keep it if I am vexed at what is going on.”

	example, death is nothing dreadful, or else Socrates too would have thought so, but the judgement that death is dreadful, [c dimgray]this[/c] is the dreadful thing. When, therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never blame anyone but ourselves, that means, our own judgements. It is the part of an uneducated person to blame others where he himself fares ill; to blame himself is the part of one whose education has begun; to blame neither another nor his own self is the part of one whose education is already complete.

	6. Be not elated at any excellence which is not your own. If the horse in his elation were to say,
	“I am beautiful,” it could be endured; but when you say in your elation, “I have a beautiful horse,”
	rest assured that you are elated at something good which belongs to a horse. What, then, is your own? The use of external impressions. Therefore, when you are in harmony with nature in the use of external impressions, then be elated; for then it will be some good of your own at which you will be elated.

	7. Just as on a voyage, when your ship has anchored, if you should go on shore to get fresh water, you may pick up a small shell-fish or little bulb[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] on the way, but you have to keep your attention fixed on the ship, and turn about frequently for fear lest the captain should call; and if he calls, you must give up all these things, if you would escape being thrown on board all tied up like the sheep. So it is also in life: If there be given you, instead of a little bulb and a small shell-fish, a little wife and child, there will be no objection to that; only, if the Captain calls, give up all these things and run

	8. Do not seek to have everything that happens happen as you wish, but wish for everything to happen as it actually does happen, and your life will be serene.

	9. Disease is an impediment to the body, but not to the moral purpose, unless that consents. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the moral purpose. And say this to yourself at each thing that befalls you; for you will find the thing to be an impediment to something else, but not to yourself.

	10. In the case of everything that befalls you, remember to turn to yourself and see what faculty you have to deal with it. If you see a handsome lad or woman, you will find continence the faculty to employ here; if hard labour is laid upon you, you will find endurance; if reviling, you will find patience to bear evil. And if you habituate yourself in this fashion, your external impressions will not run away with you.

	11. Never say about anything, “I have lost it,”
	but only “I have given it back.” Is your child dead? It has been given back. Is your wife dead? She has been given back. “I have had my farm taken away.” Very well, this too has been given back.
	“Yet it was a rascal who took it away.” But what concern is it of yours by whose instrumentality the Giver called for its return? So long as He gives it you, take care of it as of a thing that is not your own, as travellers treat their inn.

	reasoning of this sort: “If I neglect my affairs, I shall have nothing to live on.” “If I do not punish my slave-boy he will turn out bad.” For it is better to die of hunger, but in a state of freedom from grief and fear, than to live in plenty, but troubled in mind. And it is better for your slave-boy to be bad than for you to be unhappy. Begin, therefore, with the little things. Your paltry oil gets spilled, your miserable wine stolen; say to yourself, “This is the price paid for a calm spirit, this the price for peace of mind.” Nothing is got without a price. And when you call your slave-boy, bear in mind that it is possible he may not heed you, and again, that even if he does heed, he may not do what you want done. But he is not in so happy a condition that your peace of mind depends upon him.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

	13. If you wish to make progress, then be content to appear senseless and foolish in externals, do not make it your wish to give the appearance of knowing anything; and if some people think you to be an important personage, distrust yourself. For be assured that it is no easy matter to keep your moral purpose in a state of conformity with nature, and, at the same time, to keep externals; but the man who devotes his attention to one of these two things must inevitably neglect the other.

	14. If you make it your will that your children and your wife and your friends should live for ever, you are silly; for you are making it your will that things not under your control should be under your control, and that what is not your own should be your own. In the same way, too, if you make it your will that your slave-boy be free from faults, you are a fool; for you are making it your will that vice be not

	vice, but something else. If, however, it is your will not to fail in what you desire, this is in your power. Wherefore, exercise yourself in that which is in your power. Each man’s master is the person who has the authority over what the man wishes or does not wish, so as to secure it, or take it away. Whoever, therefore, wants to be free, let him neither wish for anything, nor avoid anything, that is under the control of others; or else he is necessarily a slave.

	15. Remember that you ought to behave in life as you would at a banquet. As something is being passed around it comes to you; stretch out your hand and take a portion of it politely. It passes on; do not detain it. Or it has not come to you yet; do not project your desire to meet it, but wait until it comes in front of you. So act toward children, so toward a wife, so toward office, so toward wealth; and then some day you will be worthy of the banquets of the gods. But if you do not take these things even when they are set before you, but despise them, then you will not only share the banquet of the gods, but share also their rule. For it was by so doing that Diogenes and Heracleitus, and men like them, were deservedly divine and deservedly so called.

	16. When you see someone weeping in sorrow, either because a child has gone on a journey, or because he has lost his property, beware that you be not carried away by the impression that the man is in the midst of external ills, but straightway keep before you this thought: “It is not what has happened that distresses this man (for it does not distress another), but his judgement about it.” Do

	not, however, hesitate to sympathize with him so far as words go, and, if occasion offers, even to groan with him; but be careful not to groan also in the centre of your being.

	17. Remember that you are an actor in a play, the character of which is determined by the Playwright: if He wishes the play to be short, it is short; if long, it is long; if He wishes you to play the part of a beggar, remember to act even this role adroitly; and so if your rôle be that of a cripple, an official, or a layman. For this is your business, to play admirably the rôle assigned you; but the selection of that rôle is Another’s.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

	18. When a raven croaks inauspiciously, let not the external impression carry you away, but straightway draw a distinction in your own mind, and say,” None of these portents are for me, but either for my paltry body, or my paltry estate, or my paltry opinion, or my children, or my wife. But for me every portent is favourable, if I so wish; for whatever be the outcome, it is within my power to derive benefit from it.”

	19. You can be invincible if you never enter a contest in which victory is not under your control. Beware lest, when you see some person preferred to you in honour, or possessing great power, or otherwise enjoying high repute, you are ever carried away by the external impression, and deem him happy. For if the true nature of the good is one of the things that are under our control, there is no place for either envy or jealousy; and you yourself will not wish to be a praetor, or a senator, or a consul, but a free man. Now there is but one way that leads to this, and that is to despise the things that are not under our control.

	20. Bear in mind that it is not the man who reviles or strikes you that insults you, but it is your judgement that these men are insulting you. Therefore, when someone irritates you, be assured that it is your own opinion which has irritated you. And so make it your first endeavour not to be carried away by the external impression; for if once you gain time and delay, you will more easily become master of yourself.

	21. Keep before your eyes day by day death and exile, and everything that seems terrible, but most of all death; and then you will never have any abject thought, nor will you yearn for anything beyond measure.

	22. If you yearn for philosophy, prepare at once to be met with ridicule, to have many people jeer at you, and say, “Here he is again, turned philosopher all of a sudden,” and “Where do you suppose he got that high brow? “But do you not put on a high brow, and do you so hold fast to the things which to you seem best, as a man who has been assigned by God to this post; and remember that if you abide by the same principles, those who formerly used to laugh at you will later come to admire you, but if you are worsted by them, you will get the laugh on yourself twice.

Certainly not. How, then, can this be any longer a lack of honour? And how is it that you will be “nobody anywhere,”

What do you mean by being “without assistance”? They will not have paltry coin from you, and you will not make them Roman citizens. Well, who told you that these are some of the matters under our control, and not rather things which others do? And who is able to give another what he does not himself have? “Get money, then,” says some friend, “in order that we too may have it.” If I can get money and at the same time keep myself self-respecting, and faithful, and high-minded,
	show me the way and I will get it. But if you require me to lose the good things that belong to me, in order that you may acquire the things that are not good, you can see for yourselves how unfair and inconsiderate you are. And which do you really prefer? Money, or a faithful and self-respecting friend? Help me, therefore, rather to this end, and do not require me to do those things which will make me lose these qualities.

	will be without assistance.” Again I ask, what kind of assistance do you mean? It will not have loggias or baths of your providing. And what does that signify? For neither does it have shoes provided by the blacksmith, nor has it arms provided by the cobbler; but it is sufficient if each man fulfil his own proper function. And if you secured for it another faithful and self-respecting citizen, would you not be doing it any good? “Yes.” Very well, and then you also would not be useless to it.
	“What place, then, shall I have in the State?”
	says he. Whatever place you [c dimgray]can[/c] have, and at the same time maintain the man of fidelity and self-respect
	that is in you. But if, through your desire to help the State, you lose these qualities, of what good would you become to it, when in the end you turned out to be shameless and unfaithful?

	25. Has someone been honoured above you at a dinner-party, or in salutation, or in being called in to give advice? Now if these matters are good, you ought to be happy that he got them; but if evil, be not distressed because you did not get them; and bear in mind that, if you do not act the same way that others do, with a view to getting things which are not under our control, you cannot be considered worthy to receive an equal share with others. Why, how is it possible for a person who does not haunt some man’s door, to have equal shares with the man who does? For the man who does not do escort duty, with the man who does? For the man who does not praise, with the man who does? You will be unjust, therefore, and insatiable, if, while refusing to pay the price for which such things are bought, you want to obtain them for

If, then, somebody gives up his obol and gets his heads of lettuce, while you do not give your obol, and do not get them, do not imagine that you are worse off than the man who gets his lettuce. For as he has his heads of lettuce, so you have your obol which you have not given away.

	Now it is the same way also in life. You have not been invited to somebody’s dinner-party? Of course not; for you didn’t give the host the price at which he sells his dinner. He sells it for praise; he sells it for personal attention. Give him the price, then, for which it is sold, if it is to your interest. But if you wish both not to give up the one and yet to get the other, you are insatiable and a simpleton. Have you, then, nothing in place of the dinner? Indeed you have; you have not had to praise the man you did not want to praise; you have not had to put up with the insolence of his doorkeepers.

	26. What the will of nature is may be learned from a consideration of the points in which we do not differ from one another. For example, when some other person’s slave-boy breaks his drinking-cup,
	you are instantly ready to say, “That’s one of the things which happen.” Rest assured, then, that when your own drinking-cup gets broken, you ought to behave in the same way that you do when the other man’s cup is broken. Apply now the same principle to the matters of greater importance. Some other person’s child or wife has died; no one but would say, “Such is the fate of man.” Yet when a man’s own child dies, immediately the cry is, “Alas! Woe is me! “But we

	28. If someone handed over your body to any person who met you, you would be vexed; but that you hand over your mind to any person that comes along, so that, if he reviles you, it is disturbed and troubled—are you not ashamed of that?

	29.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] In each separate thing that you do, consider the matters which come first and those which follow after, and only then approach the thing itself. Otherwise, at the start you will come to it enthusiastically, because you have never reflected upon any of the subsequent steps, but later on, when some difficulties appear, you will give up disgracefully. Do you wish to win an Olympic victory? So do I, by the gods! for it is a fine thing. But consider the matters which come before that, and those which follow after, and only when you have done that, put your hand to the task. You have to submit to discipline, follow a strict diet, give up sweet cakes, train under compulsion, at a fixed hour, in heat or in cold; you must not drink cold water,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] nor wine just whenever you feel like it; you must have turned yourself over to your trainer precisely as you would to a physician. Then when the contest comes on, you have to “dig in”[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] beside your opponent, and sometimes dislocate your wrist, sprain your ankle, swallow

	can arise.—Thus in effect Simplicius, and correctly, it seems.

	III. 15. Since it was omitted in Par., and not commented
	on by Simplicius, it may have been added in some

After you have considered all these points, go on into the games, if you still wish to do so; otherwise, you will be turning back like children. Sometimes they play wrestlers, again gladiators, again they blow trumpets, and then act a play. So you too are now an athlete, now a gladiator, then a rhetorician, then a philosopher, yet with your whole soul nothing; but like an ape you imitate whatever you see, and one thing after another strikes your fancy. For you have never gone out after anything with circumspection, nor after you had examined it all over, but you act at haphazard and half-heartedly.

Look to your arms, your thighs, see what your loins are like. For one man has a natural talent for one thing, another for another. Do you suppose that you can eat in the same fashion, drink in the same fashion, give way to impulse and to irritation, just as you do now? You must keep vigils, work hard, abandon your own people, be despised by a paltry slave, be laughed to scorn by those who meet you, in everything get the worst of it, in honour, in office, in court, in every paltry affair.

Otherwise, do not approach philosophy; don’t act like a child—now a philosopher, later on a tax-gatherer, then a rhetorician, then a procurator of Caesar. These things do not go together. You must be one person, either good or bad; you must labour to improve either your own governing principle or externals; you must work hard either on the inner man, or on things outside; that is, play either the rôle of a philosopher or else that of a layman.

	“But he is a bad father.” Did nature, then, bring you into relationship with a [c dimgray]good[/c] father? No, but simply with a father. “My brother does me wrong.” Very well, then, maintain the relation that you have toward him; and do not consider what he is doing, but what you will have to do, if your moral purpose is to be in harmony with nature. For no one will harm you without your consent; you will have been harmed only when you think you are harmed. In this way, therefore, you will discover what duty to expect of your neighbour, your citizen, your commanding officer, if you acquire the habit of looking at your social relations with them.

	31. In piety towards the gods, I would have you know, the chief element is this, to have right opinions about them—as existing and as administering the universe well and justly—and to have set yourself to obey them and to submit to everything that happens, and to follow it voluntarily, in the

	belief that it is being fulfilled by the highest intelligence. For if you act in this way, you will never blame the gods, nor find fault with them for neglecting you. But this result cannot be secured in any other way than by withdrawing your idea of the good and the evil from the things which are not under our control, and placing it in those which are under our control, and in those alone. Because, if you think any of those former things to be good or evil, then, when you fail to get what you want and fall into what you do not want, it is altogether inevitable that you will blame and hate those who are responsible for these results. For this is the nature of every living creature, to flee from and to turn aside from the things that appear harmful, and all that produces them, and to pursue after and to admire the things that are helpful, and all that produces them. Therefore, it is impossible for a man who thinks that he is being hurt to take pleasure in that which he thinks is hurting him, just as it is also impossible for him to take pleasure in the hurt itself. Hence it follows that even a father is reviled by a son when he does not give his child some share in the things that seem to be good; and this it was which made Polyneices and Eteocles enemies of one another, the thought that the royal power was a good thing. That is why the farmer reviles the gods, and so also the sailor, and the merchant, and those who have lost their wives and their children. For where a mans interest lies, there is also his piety. Wherefore, whoever is careful to exercise desire and aversion as he should, is at the same time careful also about piety. But it is always appropriate to make libations, and sacrifices,

	and to give of the firstfruits after the manner of our fathers, and to do all this with purity, and not in a slovenly or careless fashion, nor, indeed, in a niggardly way, nor yet beyond our means.

	32.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] When you have recourse to divination, remember that you do not know what the issue is going to be, but that you have come in order to find this out from the diviner; yet if you are indeed a philosopher, you know, when you arrive, what the nature of it is. For if it is one of the things which are not under our control, it is altogether necessary that what is going to take place is neither good nor evil. Do not, therefore, bring to the diviner desire or aversion, and do not approach him with trembling, but having first made up your mind that every issue is indifferent and nothing to you, but that, whatever it may be, it will be possible for you to turn it to good use, and that no one will prevent this. Go, then, with confidence to the gods as to counsellors; and after that, when some counsel has been given you, remember whom you have taken as counsellors, and whom you will be disregarding if you disobey. But go to divination as Socrates thought that men should go, that is, in cases where the whole inquiry has reference to the outcome, and where neither from reason nor from any other technical art are means vouchsafed for discovering the matter in question. Hence, when it is your duty to share the danger of a friend or of your country, do not ask of the diviner whether you ought to share that danger. For if the diviner forewarns you that the omens of sacrifice have been unfavourable, it is clear that death is portended, or the injury of some member of your body, or exile;

	yet reason requires that even at this risk you are to stand by your friend, and share the danger with your country. Wherefore, give heed to the greater diviner, the Pythian Apollo, who cast out of his temple the man who had not helped his friend when he was being murdered.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

And be silent for the most part, or else make only the most necessary remarks, and express these in few words. But rarely, and when occasion requires you to talk, talk, indeed, but about no ordinary topics. Do not talk about gladiators, or horse-races, or athletes, or things to eat or drink—topics
	that arise on all occasions; but above all, do not talk about people, either blaming, or praising, or comparing them. If, then, you can, by your own conversation bring over that of your companions to what is seemly. But if you happen to be left alone in the presence of aliens, keep silence.

That question was long ago settled by the greatest of diviners, Apollo at Delphi, who ordered to be cast out of his temple an inquirer that had once failed to defend his own friend.

	alert to avoid lapsing into the behaviour of such laymen. For you may rest assured, that, if a man’s companion be dirty, the person who keeps close company with him must of necessity get a share of his dirt, even though he himself happens to be clean.

	In your sex-life preserve purity, as for as you can, before marriage, and, if you indulge, take only those privileges which are lawful. However, do not make yourself offensive, or censorious, to those who do indulge, and do not make frequent mention of the fact that you do not yourself indulge.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If someone brings you word that So-and-so is speaking ill of you, do not defend yourself against what has been said, but answer, “Yes, indeed, for he did not know the rest of the faults that attach to me; if he had, these would not have been the only ones he mentioned.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is not necessary, for the most part, to go to the public shows. If, however, a suitable occasion ever arises, show that your principal concern is for none other than yourself, which means, wish only for that to happen which does happen, and for him only to win who does win; for so you will suffer no hindrance. But refrain utterly from shouting, or laughter at anyone, or great excitement. And after you have left, do not talk a great deal about what took place, except in so far as it contributes to your own improvement; for such behaviour indicates that the spectacle has aroused your admiration.

	34. When you get an external impression of some pleasure, guard yourself, as with impressions in general, against being carried away by it; nay, let the matter wait upon [c dimgray]your[/c] leisure, and give yourself a little delay. Next think of the two periods of time, first, that in which you will enjoy your pleasure, and second, that in which, after the enjoyment is over, you will later repent and revile your own self; and set over against these two periods of time how much joy and self-satisfaction you will get if you refrain. However, if you feel that a suitable occasion has arisen to do the deed, be careful not to allow its enticement, and sweetness, and attractiveness to overcome you; but set over against all this the thought, how much better is the consciousness of having won a victory over it.

	35. When you do a thing which you have made up your mind ought to be done, never try not to be seen doing it, even though most people are likely to think unfavourably about it. If, however, what you are doing is not right, avoid the deed itself altogether; but if it is right, why fear those who are going to rebuke you wrongly?

	you to take the larger share at a dinner is good for your body, still, it is bad for the maintenance of the proper kind of social feeling. When, therefore, you are eating with another person, remember to regard, not merely the value for your body of what lies before you, but also to maintain your respect for your host.

	37. If you undertake a role which is beyond your powers, you both disgrace yourself in that one, and at the same time neglect the role which you might have filled with success.

	38. Just as you are careful, in walking about, not to step on a nail or to sprain your ankle, so be careful also not to hurt your governing principle. And if we observe this rule in every action, we shall be more secure in setting about it.

	39. Each man’s body is a measure for his property,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] just as the foot is a measure for his shoe. If, then, you abide by this principle, you will maintain the proper measure, but if you go beyond it, you cannot help but fall headlong over a precipice, as it were, in the end. So also in the case of your shoe; if once you go beyond the foot, you get first a gilded shoe, then a purple one, then an embroidered one. For once you go beyond the measure there is no limit.

	40. Immediately after they are fourteen, women are called “ladies” by men. And so when they see that they have nothing else but only to be the bedfellows of men, they begin to beautify themselves,

	and put all their hopes in that. It is worth while for us to take pains, therefore, to make them understand that they are honoured for nothing else but only for appearing modest and self-respecting.

	41. It is a mark of an ungifted man to spend a great deal of time in what concerns his body, as in much exercise, much eating, much drinking, much evacuating of the bowels, much copulating. But these things are to be done in passing; and let your whole attention be devoted to the mind.

	42. When someone treats you ill or speaks ill of you, remember that he acts or speaks thus because he thinks it is incumbent upon him. That being the case, it is impossible for him to follow what appears good to you, but what appears good to himself; whence it follows, that, if he gets a wrong view of things, the man that suffers is the man that has been deceived. For if a person thinks a true composite judgement[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] to be false, the composite judgement does not suffer, but the person who has been deceived. If, therefore, you start from this point of view, you will be gentle with the man who reviles you. For you should say on each occasion, “He thought that way about it.”

	43. Everything has two handles, by one of which it ought to be carried and by the other not. If your brother wrongs you, do not lay hold of the matter by the handle of the wrong that he is doing, because this is the handle by which the matter ought not to be carried; but rather by the other handle—that he is your brother, that you were brought up together, and then you will be laying hold of the matter by the handle by which it ought to be carried.

	44. The following statements constitute a [c dimgray]non sequitur[/c]: “I am richer than you are, therefore I am superior to you”; or, “I am more eloquent than you are, therefore I am superior to you.” But the following conclusions are better: “I am richer than you are, therefore my property is superior to yours”; or, “I am more eloquent than you are, therefore my elocution is superior to yours.” But [c dimgray]you[/c] are neither property nor elocution.

	45. Somebody is hasty about bathing;[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] do not say that he bathes badly, but that he is hasty about bathing. Somebody drinks a good deal of wine; do not say that he drinks badly, but that he drinks a good deal. For until you have decided what judgement prompts him, how do you know that what he is doing is bad? And thus the final result will not be that you receive convincing sense-impressions of some things, but give your assent to others.

	46. On no occasion call yourself a philosopher, and do not, for the most part, talk among laymen about your philosophic principles, but do what follows from your principles. For example, at a banquet do not say how people ought to eat, but eat as a man ought. For remember how Socrates had so completely eliminated the thought of ostentation, that people came to him when they wanted him to introduce them to philosophers, and he used to bring them along. So well did he submit to being overlooked. And if talk about some philosophic principle arises among laymen, keep silence for the most part, for there is great danger that you will spew up immediately what you have not digested.

	So when a man tells you that you know nothing, and you, like Socrates, are not hurt, then rest assured that you are making a beginning with the business you have undertaken. For sheep, too, do not bring their fodder to the shepherds and show how much they have eaten, but they digest their food within them, and on the outside produce wool and milk. And so do you, therefore, make no display to the laymen of your philosophical principles, but let them see the results which come from these principles when digested.

	47. When you have become adjusted to simple living in regard to your bodily wants, do not preen yourself about the accomplishment; and so likewise, if you are a water-drinker, do not on every occasion say that you are a water-drinker. And if ever you want to train to develop physical endurance, do it by yourself and not for outsiders to behold; do not throw your arms around statues,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] but on occasion, when you are very thirsty, take cold water into your mouth, and then spit it out, without telling anybody.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	Signs of one who is making progress are: He censures no one, praises no one, blames no one, finds fault with no one, says nothing about himself as though he were somebody or knew something.

	about like an invalid, being careful not to disturb, before it has grown firm, any part which is getting well. He has put away from himself his every desire, and has transferred his aversion to those things only, of what is under our control, which are contrary to nature. He exercises no pronounced choice in regard to anything. If he gives the appearance of being foolish or ignorant he does not care. In a word, he keeps guard against himself as though he were his own enemy lying in wait.

	But what is it I want? To learn nature and to follow her. I seek, therefore, someone to interpret her; and having heard that Chrysippus does so, I go to him. But I do not understand what he has written; I seek, therefore, the person who interprets Chrysippus. And down to this point there is nothing to justify pride. But when I find the interpreter, what remains is to put his precepts into practice; this is the only thing to be proud about. If, however, I admire the mere act of interpretation, what have I done but turned into a grammarian instead of a philosopher? The only difference, indeed, is that I interpret Chrysippus instead of Homer. Far from being proud, therefore, when somebody says to me, “Read me Chrysippus,” I blush the rather, when I am unable to show him such deeds as match and harmonize with his words.

	impiety for you to transgress them. But pay no attention to what somebody says about you, for this is, at length, not under your control.

	51. How long will you still wait to think yourself worthy of the best things, and in nothing to transgress against the distinctions set up by the reason? You have received the philosophical principles which you ought to accept, and you have accepted them. What sort of a teacher, then, do you still wait for, that you should put off reforming yourself until he arrives? You are no longer a lad, but already a full-grown man. If you are now neglectful and easy-going, and always making one delay after another, and fixing first one day and then another, after which you will pay attention to yourself, then without realizing it you will make no progress, but, living and dying, will continue to be a layman throughout. Make up your mind, therefore, before it is too late, that the fitting thing for you to do is to live as a mature man who is making progress, and let everything which seems to you to be best be for you a law that must not be transgressed. And if you meet anything that is laborious, or sweet, or held in high repute, or in no repute, remember that [c dimgray]now[/c] is the contest, and here before you are the Olympic games, and that it is impossible to delay any longer, and that it depends on a single day and a single action, whether progress is lost or saved. This is the way Socrates became what he was, by paying attention to nothing but his reason in everything that he encountered. And even if you are not yet a Socrates, still you ought to live as one who wishes to be a Socrates.

	52. The first and most necessary division in philosophy is that which has to do with the application of the principles, as, for example, Do not lie. The second deals with the demonstrations, as, for example, How comes it that we ought not to lie? The third confirms and discriminates between these processes, as, for example, How does it come that this is a proof? For what is a proof, what is logical consequence, what contradiction, what truth, what falsehood? Therefore, the third division is necessary because of the second, and the second because of the first; while the most necessary of all, and the one in which we ought to rest, is the first. But we do the opposite; for we spend our time in the third division, and all our zeal is devoted to it, while we utterly neglect the first. Wherefore, we lie, indeed, but are ready with the arguments which prove that one ought not to lie.

	53. Upon every occasion we ought to have the following thoughts at our command:

	Lead thou me on, O Zeus, and Destiny,
