	According to the ancient headnote (Hypothesis), [c dimgray]Persians[/c]
	was produced in 472 bc, as the second play in a four-play
	production (see below) which won first prize; it is thus, if
	the currently accepted dating of [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] to the 460s
	is correct, the earliest surviving European drama. The
	[c dimgray]choregos[/c] who financed the production was none other
	than Pericles, then about twenty-three years old. Pericles’
	father, Xanthippus, had played a notable role in the Persian
	war: he had been the Athenian naval commander, in
	succession to Themistocles, in 479, had led the Athenian
	contingent at the victorious battle of Mycale, and then, after
	his Peloponnesian allies had abandoned the campaign,
	had gone on to capture Sestos on the Hellespont, whence
	he brought home to Athens, for dedication in a sanctuary,
	the cables of the bridge of boats by which Xerxes’ army had
	crossed the straits[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]—a bridge of which our play has a great
	deal to say.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Persians[/c] was not the first tragedy to take its subject
	from recent events instead of from those of heroic times.

	same thing at least twice. In 493 or 492 he had produced
	[c dimgray]The Capture of Miletus,[/c] highlighting the calamity that had
	befallen this famous Ionian city, a calamity for which many
	Athenians felt Athens was partly to blame for having withdrawn
	its support from the Ionians rebelling against Persian
	rule; for this he was fined, and all further performance
	of the play prohibited.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Much later, probably in 476 and
	with Themistocles himself—the hero of Salamis, and the
	creator of the fleet that triumphed there—as his [c dimgray]choregos,[/c][c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	Phrynichus had staged a production at least part of which
	was devoted to the Graeco-Persian war,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] seen from the
	side of the Persians (and their non-Greek subject nations)
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Herodotus 6.21.2. Presumably the prohibition referred to
	possible performances at local deme festivals; it was to be many
	years before anyone thought of producing the same play a second
	time at the City Dionysia itself.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]It is known that Phrynichus won a victory, with Themistocles
	as [c dimgray]choregos,[/c] in this year (Plutarch, [c dimgray]Themistocles[/c] 5.5); there is no
	proof that this victory was gained with his Persian War plays, but
	the parallel with Pericles’ sponsorship of Aeschylus’ production,
	and the unlikelihood that a shrewd politician like Themistocles
	would miss the opportunity for self-promotion that such a production
	on such a subject would provide, raise a strong presumption
	that it was. Indeed, it is quite possible that Themistocles had [c dimgray]suggested[/c]
	the subject to Phrynichus.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]Our sources, including the Hypothesis to [c dimgray]Persians,[/c] mostly
	refer in this connection to Phrynichus’ [c dimgray]Phoenician Women,[/c] but
	the [c dimgray]Suda’s[/c] list of his plays (φ762) also mentions another play
	for which it offers three alternative titles—[c dimgray]The Righteous Men,
	The Persians,[/c] and [c dimgray]The Committee[/c] (lit. “men sitting together”).
	Probably the title [c dimgray]The Phoenician Women,[/c] being that of the best-known
	play in the production, was sometimes applied to the
	whole of it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 2[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Aeschylus[/b]
	and presented less as a Greek triumph than as their enemies’
	catastrophe. The plays, especially [c dimgray]The Phoenician
	Women,[/c] were long remembered for the beauty of their
	lyrics.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is likely that at the time when Aeschylus produced
	[c dimgray]Persians,[/c] Phrynichus had recently died. The opening
	words of Aeschylus’ play are a near-quotation from the
	opening of the corresponding play of Phrynichus’ production;
	it is unlikely that Aeschylus would have chosen to pay
	such a compliment to a living rival, and there is no evidence
	of Phrynichus being alive at any later date. Aeschylus
	thus advertises that he is following in Phrynichus’ footsteps,
	but we can be sure that his treatment of the theme
	was very different from that of his older contemporary.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In particular, whereas Phrynichus had spread the story
	over at least two (possibly three) plays,[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] Aeschylus concentrates
	it into one. In the play of Phrynichus’ production
	(probably [c dimgray]The Righteous Men[/c])[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] whose opening line Aeschylus
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]The old jurors in Aristophanes’ [c dimgray]Wasps,[/c] on their way to court,
	are said to sing μέλη ἀρχαιομελισιδωνοφρυνιχήρατα (“lovely
	old honeyed Sidonian \[i.e. Phoenician\] Phrynichus songs”)
	([c dimgray]Wasps[/c] 219–220).
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]That our sources tell us of only two relevant plays of his is of
	no significance: we only know the titles of ten plays of Phrynichus
	altogether, from a career that may have lasted nearly forty years.
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c]The Hypothesis says it was [c dimgray]The Phoenician Women,[/c] but the
	scene it describes, with a eunuch “spreading <fleeces or textiles
	over> chairs for the assessors of the ruling power”, is clearly one of
	preparation for a meeting of Persian councillors, and surely therefore
	must come from the play that was named after them; see H.
	Lloyd-Jones, [c dimgray]Greek Epic, Lyric and Tragedy[/c] (Oxford, 1990) 233–4

	[b]Aeschylus[/b]
	imitated, “the defeat of Xerxes”—this must mean
	Salamis, the only Greek victory over the Persians at which
	Xerxes was present in person—was already known about
	in the Persian capital and was mentioned in the prologue
	speech; it is plausible therefore to suppose that [c dimgray]The Phoenician Women[/c]
	came first, and that in the course of that play
	the chorus learned of the disaster of Salamis and of their
	own widowhood. The depth of their grief, and the poignancy
	of its expression, can well be imagined: many tragic
	choruses mourn and lament, but no surviving tragic chorus
	laments a personal bereavement which its members
	have [c dimgray]themselves[/c] experienced, or learned of, during the
	course of the play.[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] Perhaps in the following play, as Persia
	struggled to recover from Salamis (and with Xerxes now
	back home?), word may have arrived of the crowning catastrophe
	of Plataea.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Aeschylus ingeniously reshapes these elements into a
	new and much tauter package. He takes from Phrynichus’
	[c dimgray]second[/c] play the chorus of Persian councillors, with a council
	meeting (140–5) as the first significant event, but like
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]The Persian elders in Aeschylus’ play learn of a disaster
	which must have cost the lives of some of their sons, but their grief
	remains always national, not personal. In Aeschylus’ lost [c dimgray]Daughters
	of the Sun,[/c] however, the chorus will have learned of the death
	of their brother Phaëthon, and in his [c dimgray]Danaids[/c] the chorus almost
	certainly lost their father Danaus. In Euripides’ [c dimgray]Children of
	Heracles[/c] the chorus lose a sister when one of Heracles’ daughters
	(often, but not in the play itself, called Macaria) offers herself as a
	sacrifice to secure victory for the Athenians over Eurystheus’
	army; but far from grieving over her death they urge Iolaus [c dimgray]not[/c] to
	grieve, because the maiden has won herself eternal glory (618–629).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 4[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Aeschylus[/b]
	Phrynichus’ [c dimgray]first[/c] play, this one begins with the fate of
	Xerxes’ expedition still entirely unknown, and the shattering
	news of Salamis[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] arrives in the course of the play. Few
	will then have expected to hear of Plataea too, but Aeschylus
	contrives to include it by having the ghost of Darius
	summoned up from below and making him deliver a precise
	prophecy of the coming defeat, even though he is represented
	as at first knowing nothing of what has happened
	at Salamis.[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] Then, and only then, a humiliated Xerxes returns
	home, apparently in rags—in the sharpest contrast to
	the elaborate, costly robes of his councillors, and those in
	which we have just seen his father clad;[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] and the feminine
	laments with which [c dimgray]The Phoenician Women[/c] so abounded
	are put in the mouths of the male Xerxes and the male chorus—for,
	as Edith Hall has shown, the image of the Persian
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]All the more shattering because, up to that point, the Persians
	at home seem entirely unaware that the Greeks have a navy
	at all; we have heard of the Persian fleet (19, 39, 55, 76, 83), but
	the Greeks are thought of simply as spear-fighters (85, 148–9,
	240), and the information about Athens which the Elders give the
	Queen (231–244) includes not a word about ships.
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]This is achieved by supposing that Darius, and apparently
	no one else (not even Xerxes, 744), knows of an oracle that predicted
	these events; he had assumed that it would be fulfilled in
	some distant future (740–1), but now, seeing that the first part of
	the prophecy has come true, he knows that the second part will
	soon come true also, “for oracles are not fulfilled by halves” (802).
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]There has earlier been a similar contrast between the robes
	of the Queen at her first, vehicle-borne entrance (150ff) and the
	simple garb in which she returns, “without my carriage and without
	my former luxury” (607–8).

	male has been systematically feminized all through the
	play.[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Although, however, Aeschylus has thus concentrated
	the substance of Phrynichus’ two (or three) plays into one,
	he may nevertheless have suffused his entire production
	with the glow of the great Greek victory over the barbarian.
	The production of 472 is the only one by Aeschylus[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c]
	that is known to have consisted of four plays whose stories
	were, on the face of it, unrelated—indeed, they were not
	even placed in proper chronological order. The first play
	was [c dimgray]Phineus,[/c] about an episode in the saga of the Argonauts.
	[c dimgray]Persians[/c] followed; then the audience were taken back to
	the heroic age with [c dimgray]Glaucus of Potniae[/c]—which might have
	made a vaguely appropriate sequel to [c dimgray]Phineus,[/c] since
	Glaucus was killed (torn apart by his own horses) at the funeral
	games of Pelias whose death had been caused by the
	wiles of Medea after Jason’s return from Colchis, if only
	[c dimgray]Persians[/c] had not intervened—and then to a satyr-play
	about Prometheus ([c dimgray]Prometheus the Fire-Bearer[/c] or[c dimgray]Fire-Kindler[/c]).
	Such a miscellaneous collection would have been
	quite normal later in the century, but it is somewhat surprising
	to find it at this date—and it is far from surprising
	to find that repeated efforts have been made to find
	[m1]\ [/m]

	later Greek tragedy).

	[c dimgray]Perseus[/c] was followed, with or without another play intervening, by

	method behind the apparent madness, with little success.[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In a forthcoming article[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c] I have suggested that the unifying
	feature of, at least, the three tragic plays in this production
	was nothing other than the Persian War itself.
	[c dimgray]Phineus[/c] dealt with the rescue of Phineus and the destruction
	of his tormentors, the Harpies, by Zetes and Calaïs,
	sons of Boreas the North Wind and the Athenian princess
	Oreithyia; and it was to Boreas and Oreithyia that the
	Athenians successfully prayed (or so they said) before the
	northeasterly gale that wrecked many of the Persians’
	ships near Cape Sepias shortly before the simultaneous
	battles of Artemisium and Thermopylae.[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] Phineus was a
	prophet, and is reported elsewhere to have given, in that
	capacity, valuable information to the Argonauts;[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c] he could
	very well have added a prediction of the blessing that
	Boreas would one day confer on the descendants of his father-in-law
	Erechtheus. As to [c dimgray]Glaucus of Potniae[/c]—one of
	two lost Aeschylean plays about different mythical characters
	named Glaucus—there is an Aeschylean fragment
	(25a), cited by a scholiast on Pindar simply as from Aeschylus’
	[c dimgray]Glaucus,[/c] in which someone speaks of having come to
	the river Himeras (or the city of Himera) in Sicily. This has,

	on the face of it, nothing to do with the plot either of
	[c dimgray]Glaucus of Potniae[/c] (whose action, on and off stage, was set
	in Boeotia and Thessaly) or of Aeschylus’ other play of the
	same name, [c dimgray]Glaucus the Sea-god[/c] (whose settings were
	Boeotia, Euboea, and the straits between them); it does,
	however, have something to do with the Persian War, or
	rather with the simultaneous war between Carthage and
	the Sicilian Greeks, in which the latter won a major victory
	at Himera on, it was believed, the same day as the Greeks
	of the homeland did at Salamis.[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] I have suggested that fr.
	25a comes from [c dimgray]Glaucus of Potniae[/c];[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] that its speaker was
	Poseidon, an appropriate god to appear in a play about the
	mistreatment and revenge of a team of horses;[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] and that
	he narrated a journey he had made to Himera[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c] and prophesied
	that one day (in gratitude for good treatment he had

	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]Herodotus 7.166.
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]This play also contained another reference to the western
	Greek lands, very likely in the same speech: fr. 40a (33 Nauck),
	cited by Hesychius from [c dimgray]Glaucus of Potniae[/c] (though arbitrarily ascribed
	to [c dimgray]Glaucus the Sea-god[/c] by most scholars since Hermann),
	refers to a harbour in or near the Strait of Messina.
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c]And a god whom Xerxes is mentioned in [c dimgray]Persians[/c] (750) as
	having particularly offended.
	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c]Has he now come directly thence to Potniae to deal with
	the situation created by Glaucus’ death, as Athena in [c dimgray]Eumenides[/c]
	(397ff) comes directly from Sigeum in the Troad to Athens to answer
	the appeal of Orestes? And is it significant that Potniae was
	on the road from Plataea to Thebes, so that Athenian troops would
	have passed through the village when they marched on Thebes a
	few days after the battle of Plataea?

	over their enemies.[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c] Thus each of the first three plays of
	this production would narrate and/or foretell an important
	episode or episodes in the defeat of the great barbarian invasions
	of 480/79.[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c] We do not know enough about the
	fourth play to be able to determine whether it too followed
	this pattern.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The production of a tragedy (indeed, if the argument of
	the last paragraph is right, of a whole trilogy) about events
	of a war that was still in progress—a play, moreover, which,
	while it did not mention any individual Athenian, alluded
	clearly enough to the exploits of Xanthippus (see above)
	and especially of Themistocles (353–363, not to mention
	the whole great narrative of his victory at Salamis)—has inevitably
	caused speculation as to whether it might have
	been designed to have some political impact, particularly
	in light of the earlier production by Phrynichus on the
	same subject for which Themistocles himself was probably
	[c dimgray]choregos[/c] (see above). It is known that Themistocles was
	ostracized at some time in the late 470s, but it is not known
	precisely when; all the same, even if this occurred later
	than 472, it was probably not his enemies’ first attempt to
	get rid of him.[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] Both Themistocles and (when he entered

	by Syracusan [c dimgray]cavalry[/c] while making a sacrifice to [c dimgray]Poseidon[/c]
	(Diodorus Siculus 11.21.4–22.1).
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c]Salamis, Plataea and Himera are likewise mentioned together
	in Pindar’s [c dimgray]First Pythian[/c] (75–80), performed before
	Hieron at Aetna in 470.
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c]Before any particular individual could be ostracized (banished
	for ten years without loss of property) three hurdles had to
	be surmounted: (i) the Assembly had to vote that an ostracism be held; (ii) at a special Assembly held some two months later, a total
	of at least 6000 votes had to be cast; (iii) the person who had the
	most votes against him would then be ostracized. There may have
	been one or several attempts at ostracizing Themistocles which
	failed at the first or second hurdle, before the one that finally succeeded.

	substitutes οἰχομένων, which carries a strong (though by the

	But by now the spirit within me,

	posit a lacuna, we are forced to assume that the νέος ἀνήρ is
	Xerxes (cf. 782) and that it is “the strength of the Asiatic race” (i.e.
	the army) which is “howling” about him; but it makes no sense that
	the chorus should make confident assertions about the state of
	opinion in the army when the whole context is concerned with the

	will tell you about it. There seemed to come into my sight
	two finely dressed women, one arrayed in Persian, the
	other in Doric robes,[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c] outstandingly superior in stature to
	the women of real life, of flawless beauty, and sisters of the
	same stock: one, by the fall of the lot, was a native and inhabitant
	of the land of Greece, the other of the Orient.[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c] I
	seemed to see these two raising some kind of strife between
	themselves; my son, perceiving this, tried to restrain
	and calm them, yoked them under his chariot, and passed
	the yoke-strap under their necks. One of them, thus arrayed,
	towered up proudly, and kept her jaw submissively
	in harness; but the other began to struggle, tore the harness
	from the chariot with her hands, dragged it violently
	along without bridle or bit, and smashed the yoke in half.
	My son fell out. His father Darius appeared, standing beside
	him and showing pity; but when Xerxes saw him, he
	tore the robes that clothed his body. That, I say, is what I
	saw in the night. When I had risen and washed my hands in
	a fair-flowing spring, I approached the altar with offerings
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c]Aeschylus chooses to dress the woman representing Greece
	in “Doric” rather than “Ionic” style, not because he is imagining
	her as a Dorian Greek (e.g. a Spartan)—both styles were in use in the Athens of his day—but because the Doric [c dimgray]chiton[/c] (typically
	woollen, and pinned at the shoulders) symbolized Greek simplicity,
	in contrast to Persian luxury, more effectively than the Ionic
	(draped, and often of fine linen). Both styles are seen, for example,
	on an amphora of about 460 bc in Oxford (Ashmolean 280)
	showing a father, mother and sister bidding farewell to a departing
	warrior; see S. Lewis, [c dimgray]The Athenian Woman[/c] (London, 2002) 41
	fig. 1.22.
	[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c]Frequently in this play Persians speak of themselves as
	βάρβαροι, properly a Greek term for those who did not speak the
	Greek language; I have translated this throughout as “orient(al)”
	or “Eastern(er)” (but in other plays, where the term is used by
	Greeks, I have retained the traditional rendering “barbarian”).

	in my hand, wishing to pour a rich libation to the deities
	who avert evil, for whom such rites are appropriate. Then I
	saw an eagle fleeing for refuge to the altar of Phoebus[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c]—and I was rooted speechless to the spot with terror, my
	friends. Next I saw a hawk swooping on him at full speed
	with beating wings, and tearing at his head with its
	talons[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c]—and he simply cowered and submitted.[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c] This
	was terrifying for me to behold, and must be terrifying for
	you to hear; for you know well that if my son were successful
	he would be a very much admired man, but were he to
	fail—well, he is not accountable to the community,[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c] and if

	Mother, we do not wish to say what would make you either

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c]The omen is easy to interpret (as is evident from the fact
	that Aeschylus leaves his audience to interpret it for themselves):
	that the mother of the greatest of human kings, full of anxiety
	about his fate, sees the “king of birds” ([c dimgray]Agamemnon[/c] 114) fleeing
	from a bird of lesser status and submitting without resistance to
	degrading treatment, speaks for itself. Various explanations have
	been offered for why the eagle is represented as seeking the altar
	of Phoebus (Apollo) in particular; I suggest that the point is that the eagle is going [c dimgray]to the worst possible place[/c]—for the eagle is the
	bird of Zeus, not Apollo, and the latter, though his best-known
	avian connection is with swans, also has one with hawks ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c]
	15.237; [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 15.526; Aristophanes, [c dimgray]Birds[/c] 516). Contrast Aesop,
	[c dimgray]Fable[/c] 3 Perry, where the eagle seeks sanctuary from an
	enemy by nesting in the lap of Zeus. Has Xerxes too gone to the
	most unpropitious place he could have chosen?
	[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c]No real hawk would or could do this (even if, [c dimgray]per impossibile,[/c]
	it were to attack an eagle), but cf. [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 15.526–7.
	[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c]lit. “provided his body” (to be abused).
	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c]Unlike an Athenian general such as Miltiades, who not long
	after his victory at Marathon was nearly sentenced to death for
	failing to capture Paros, and eventually died in prison (Herodotus
	6.136; Plato, [c dimgray]Gorgias[/c] 516d-e; Plutarch, [c dimgray]Cimon[/c] 4.4).

	[c dimgray][sup]43[/sup][/c]This has been seen as a reference to the Persians’ system of
	fast couriers (Aeschylus alludes to them at [c dimgray]Agamemnon[/c] 282—but
	they were mounted), or as a chauvinistic gibe, from a Greek point
	of view, at Persians’ alleged cowardice (they run very fast—away
	from the enemy); more likely it is simply based on observation of
	the actual running styles of Greeks and Persians respectively. It would not be surprising if these styles tended to differ, given that
	Greek running techniques had been honed by many generations
	of athletic competition.

	d’Eschyle[/c] \[Paris, 1890\] 11–14, and again by K. Sier, [c dimgray]Hermes[/c] 133

	earlier, to reveal to the chorus that the catastrophic battle was

	“among the drifting planks” (cf. [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 12.67).
	[c dimgray][sup]49[/sup][/c]The text has been corrupted by the intrusion of annotations

	[c dimgray][sup]54[/sup][/c]πολεῖ would normally imply wandering or ranging across

	[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c]This line (315) is clearly out of place where it stands in the

	[c dimgray][sup]57[/sup][/c]Possibly the town of this name in the Troad is meant (cf.

	I assure you that, so far as numbers are concerned, the
	fleet of the Easterners would have prevailed. The Greeks
	had a grand total of about three hundred ships,[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c] and ten of
	these formed a special select squadron; whereas Xerxes—I
	know this for sure—had a thousand under his command,
	and those of outstanding speed numbered two hundred
	and seven.[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c] Such is the reckoning; I hardly imagine you’ll
	consider we were inferior in [c dimgray]that[/c] respect in the battle! It
	was some divinity that destroyed our fleet like this, weighting
	the scales so that fortune did not fall out even: the gods
	have saved the city of the goddess Pallas.

	[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c]lit. “ten thirties of ships”. Herodotus (8.43–48) gives the
	total of the Greek fleet as 385, of which 180 were Athenian. The
	Persian messenger cannot of course give an exact figure, and Aeschylus
	rounds down rather than up so as to maximize the disparity
	between the two fleets.
	[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c]The natural way of understanding this is to take the 207
	extra-fast ships to be part of the total of 1000, just as the ten ships
	of the Greek élite squadron are part of their total of 300.
	Herodotus (7.89. 1, 7.184.1) seems to have read the passage otherwise,
	for he gives the total numbers of the Persian fleet, when it first reached Greece, as precisely 1207; they suffered, however,
	according to his narrative, severe losses before Salamis (by storm,
	and in the battle of Artemisium), and at Salamis they did not
	greatly outnumber the Greeks (8.13; contrast 8.66 where he implausibly
	claims that the losses were made good by reinforcements
	from subjugated Greek states).
	[c dimgray][sup]63[/sup][/c]This either alludes to, or else it inspired, the story of
	Themistocles’ retort to the Corinthian Adeimantus at the Greek
	council of war which finally decided to stand and fight at Salamis.
	Adeimantus had tried to silence Themistocles, and prevent his
	proposal being put to a vote, because Themistocles was “a man
	without a city”, Attica having been evacuated by its population,
	its territory occupied by the Persians, and the city sacked and
	burned; to which Themistocles replied “We have a city and a
	country greater than yours, while we have two hundred ships and
	their crews” (Herodotus 8.61).

	The start of all our sorrows, mistress, was the appearance

	come on, the Greeks would not stay where they were, but
	would leap on to the benches of their ships and seek to save
	their lives by taking to flight in all directions under cover of
	the darkness. As soon as he heard this, not understanding
	the deceit of the Greek or the jealousy of the gods, he proclaimed
	the following order to all his admirals. When the
	sun ceased to burn the earth with its rays, and darkness
	took hold of the celestial regions, they were to arrange the
	mass of their ships in three lines and guard the exits[c dimgray][sup]65[/sup][/c] and
	the surging straits, while stationing others so as to surround
	the island of Ajax completely;[c dimgray][sup]66[/sup][/c] because if the
	Greeks should escape grim death by finding some means
	of escaping unnoticed with their ships, it was decreed that
	all the admirals were to lose their heads. So much he said,

	There is an island in front of Salamis,[c dimgray][sup]72[/sup][/c] small and offering
	no good anchorage for ships, whose seashore is a haunt of
	Pan, lover of dances.[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c] Xerxes sent these men there so that,
	when shipwrecked enemy men were trying to reach safety
	on the island, they could kill the Greek warriors when they
	were an easy prey while rescuing their own men from the
	straits of the sea; he was reading the future badly. When
	god had given the triumph in the naval battle to the
	Greeks, that same day they clad themselves in stout bronze
	armour, leaped off their ships, and landed all around the island,
	so that the Persians had no idea which way to turn.
	They were being heavily battered by hand-thrown stones,
	and hit and killed by arrows shot from the bowstring, until
	finally the Greeks charged them in a simultaneous rush
	and struck them down, hacking the wretched men’s limbs
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]72[/sup][/c]This island was Psyttaleia, on which, according to
	Herodotus (8.76.1–2), Xerxes stationed “many of the Persians”
	(Pausanias 1.36.2 gives the number as about 400) with the same
	objective as is stated here; they were killed to the last man by an Athenian hoplite force, led by Aristeides, which crossed over from
	Salamis while the naval battle was in progress (Herodotus 8.95).
	In Aeschylus’ treatment, on the other hand, the Greek attack on
	the island is made immediately [c dimgray]after[/c] the naval battle, and by the
	same men who had fought it. Psyttaleia has been identified in
	modern times, sometimes with the island now officially so named
	(formerly Lipsokoutali) between Cynosura and the Peiraeus,
	sometimes with the island of Aghios Georghios in the bay north of
	Salamis town.
	[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c]Pausanias [c dimgray]loc.cit[/c]. noted that there were many roughly-carved
	wooden images of Pan on the island.

	O Zeus the King, now, now by destroying
	the army of the boastful
	and populous Persian nation
	you have covered the city of Susa and Agbatana
	with a dark cloud of mourning.
	Many <mothers in a piteous plight>[c dimgray][sup]84[/sup][/c]
	are rending their veils with their delicate hands
	and wetting the folds of their garments till they are
	soaked through
	with tears, as they take their share in the sorrow;
	and the soft, wailing Persian women who yearn
	to see the men they lately wedded,
	abandoning the soft-coverleted beds they had slept in,
	the delight of their pampered youth,
	grieve with wailing that is utterly insatiable.
	And I too shoulder the burden of the death of the
	departed,
	truly a theme for mourning far and wide.

	[c dimgray][sup]83[/sup][/c]Probably to be taken as a guarded hint that she fears that
	Xerxes in his humiliation may commit suicide.
	[c dimgray][sup]84[/sup][/c]I translate the supplement suggested by Dindorf; something
	of the sort is necessary to identify the women being spoken
	of here in contrast with the widowed brides of 541–5, who are introduced
	(note αἱ δ)’ as a group distinct from them.

	3.12.7; Plutarch, [c dimgray]Theseus[/c] 10.3, [c dimgray]Solon[/c] 9.1). He was linked
	mythically to the family of Telamon and Ajax by being said to have
	died leaving a daughter who became either the mother or the wife
	of Telamon. During the battle of Salamis he appeared to the Athenians
	in the form of a serpent (Pausanias 1.36.1). Sophocles (fr.

	of fear: before my eyes there appear hostile visions from

	cow; the distilled product of the flower-worker,[c dimgray][sup]92[/sup][/c] gleaming
	honey, together with a libation of water from a virgin
	spring; a drink that has come unsullied from its wild-growing
	mother, this juice of an old vine; and also here are the

	[c dimgray][sup]97[/sup][/c]Since this form of the king’s name is no closer than the regular

	[c dimgray][sup]98[/sup][/c]The verb is corrupt beyond confident restoration (and the

	[c dimgray][sup]111[/sup][/c]Probably to be taken as the (mythical) eponymous founder
	of the kingdom of the Medes (cf. on 236). Later tragedians spoke
	of a Medus, son of Medea and Aegeus, as the ancestor of the
	Median people (Diodorus Siculus 4.55.5–56.1; \[Apollodorus\],
	[c dimgray]Library[/c] 1.9.28). Alternatively Μῆδος may mean “a Mede”, in
	which case the reference will be to Cyaxares (reigned ca.625–585),
	the first Median king to extend his rule into Asia Minor; in
	that case his son will be Astyages, the maternal grandfather of
	Cyrus, eventually deposed by him.
	[c dimgray][sup]112[/sup][/c]lit. “turned the helm of”.
	[c dimgray][sup]113[/sup][/c]This was Cambyses (reigned 529–522), the conqueror of
	Egypt.
	[c dimgray][sup]114[/sup][/c]In Herodotus (3.61–79) he is called Smerdis and said to be
	a usurper impersonating Cambyses’ brother of the same name (in
	Persian [c dimgray]Bardiya[/c]); so too Darius himself in the Behistun inscription
	(§§11–15; translated in M. Brosius, [c dimgray]The Persian Empire from
	Cyrus II to Artaxerxes I[/c] \[London, 2000\] 23–24, 27–40) except that
	he calls the usurper Gaumata.
	[c dimgray][sup]115[/sup][/c]Herodotus (3.70ff) calls this man Intaphrenes, which is
	considerably closer to the Persian [c dimgray]Vindafarnā[/c]; evidently Aeschylus
	has confused him with a man much better known to Greeks,
	Darius’ brother, the governor of Sardis at the time of the Ionian
	revolt (Herodotus 5.25.1 etc.), whose son of the same name had
	been joint commander of the Persian forces at Marathon.

	The genuineness of the line is defended by M. L. West in M. A.
	Flower and M. Toher ed. [c dimgray]Georgica: Studies in Honour of George[/c] [c dimgray]Cawkwell[/c] (London, 1991) 184–8; but the text in this form gives no
	indication of who Maraphis was, leaves the nature of the connection
	between Artaphrenes and Darius completely undefined,
	makes Darius claim no credit at all for the assassination of the
	“disgrace” Mardus, and fails to explain why Artaphrenes, having
	masterminded Mardus’ death, did not succeed immediately himself.
	See W. Kraus, [c dimgray]Wiener Studien[/c] 104 (1991) 90–91. The interpolated
	line may derive ultimately from a marginal variant
	(Μάραφις for Μάρδος) on 774, itself based on an apparent statement
	by the historian Hellanicus ([c dimgray]FGrH[/c] 4 F 180, cited in a
	scholium on 770) that Cambyses’ brothers were named Maraphis
	and Merphis; if the variant was written at the bottom of a column,
	below line 777, it could have been mistaken for a remnant of a lost
	line, and a “restoration” of that line cobbled together.

	When they came to the land of Greece, they did not

	temples: altars have vanished, and the abodes of deities
	have been ruined, uprooted, wrenched from their foundations.
	Because of this evil they have done, they are suffering

	[c dimgray][sup]124[/sup][/c]The transmitted text is unmetrical, and, to the extent that it

	stability of Persian laws, a subject with no relevance to the surrounding

	reference to the sacking of cities (for this theme cf. 65, 105–8, 178,
	348). I suspect therefore that πάντ᾿ ἐπεύθυνον is a fragment of a

	[c dimgray][sup]128[/sup][/c]The reference is to the lake-villages of the Strymon basin
	(cf. Herodotus 5.16), well known to Athenians in 472 because of

	[c dimgray][sup]142[/sup][/c]The man’s name is lost.
	[c dimgray][sup]143[/sup][/c]The Mardi were a nomadic Persian tribe (Herodotus

	[c dimgray][sup]144[/sup][/c]Another Iranian people (Herodotus 7.66.1).
	[c dimgray][sup]145[/sup][/c]This is the name to which the manuscript tradition seems

	[c dimgray][sup]146[/sup][/c]i.e. a carriage with curtains (the normal Greek word was
	ἁρμάμαξα), to Greeks an emblem of Persian luxury (cf. Aristophanes, [c dimgray]Acharnians[/c] 70). On his westward march to Greece,
	Xerxes travelled sometimes in a chariot, sometimes in a ἁρμάμαξα,
	with “a thousand of the noblest and bravest Persians”
	following him, together with other picked troops (Herodotus
	7.41.1–2). The Persian elders had expected that he would return
	in similar style, with his carriage and his escort: he has come back
	with neither.
	[c dimgray][sup]147[/sup][/c]I translate West’s conjecture ([c dimgray]Studies[/c] 94–95), which involves
	a syntactic construction not exactly paralleled but gives
	excellent sense, especially in contrasting the Persians’ “age-old
	good fortune” with their “new” (1010) and unanticipated (1006)
	disaster.

AESCHYLUS, Seven against Thebes
	[c darkmagenta][b]AESCHYLUS, Seven against Thebes[/b][/c]
		[m1]\ [/m][b]Aeschylus[/b]
	[b]Seven Against Thebes[/b]
	[c dimgray]Seven against Thebes[/c][c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] was produced at the City Dionysia
	of 467 bc as the third part of a four-play production—that
	is, the last play in a tragic trilogy; it was preceded by [c dimgray]Laius[/c]
	and [c dimgray]Oedipus,[/c] and followed by the satyr-drama [c dimgray]The Sphinx.[/c]
	The production won first prize. Both the rival dramatists
	on this occasion were sons of famous tragic poets of the
	previous generation. One of them, Aristias (who took second
	place) was actually producing the plays of his father
	Pratinas,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] who doubtless had died recently leaving these
	compositions behind him, just as the last plays of Euripides
	and of Sophocles were produced posthumously by
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]This title, though already current in the late fifth century
	(Aristophanes, [c dimgray]Frogs[/c] 1021), is unlikely to be Aeschylean, since nowhere
	in the play are Thebes or the Thebans referred to under
	those names; they are always called the city and people of
	Cadmus. I have argued, indeed, that in Aeschylus’ time, where the
	plays of a tragic trilogy presented a sequence of episodes in a single
	story, it was not customary to give separate titles to the individual
	dramas; see [c dimgray]Hermes[/c] 117 (1989) 432–6 and [c dimgray]Seminari Romani[/c] 5
	(2002) 4–5.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]So the papyrus version of the Hypothesis ([c dimgray]Oxyrhynchus Papyrus[/c]
	2256 fr. 2); in the early medieval manuscript M (the only
	one to preserve the relevant part of the Hypothesis) the satyrdrama
	alone is said to have been Pratinas’ work.

	members of their families: his production included [c dimgray]Perseus,
	Tantalus,[/c] and a satyr-drama called [c dimgray]The Wrestlers.[/c][c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] In
	third place came Polyphrasmon, son of Phrynichus, with a
	tetralogy about Lycurgus, a subject that Aeschylus would
	take up a few years later.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] Sophocles, who had been victorious
	the previous year, was not competing.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The story of Laius, Oedipus, and the wars for possession
	of Thebes among members of the latter’s family after
	his death, had long been familiar throughout the
	Greek world, and was the subject of three early epics, the
	[c dimgray]Oedipodeia,[/c] the [c dimgray]Thebaid[/c] (about the curse of Oedipus,
	the quarrel between his sons, and the expedition of the
	Seven), and the [c dimgray]Epigoni[/c] (about the attack on, and destruction
	of, Thebes by the sons of the Seven).[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] Sophocles’
	treatment of it in [c dimgray]Antigone, Oedipus the King,[/c] and [c dimgray]Oedipus
	at Colonus[/c] (to name his three plays in the order of their
	composition) has become canonical for later times, but we
	are not entitled to take it for granted that the stories were
	used by, or even necessarily known to, Aeschylus in the
	form that Sophocles gave them.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] Our actual fragments of
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]There must have been a further tragedy, but its title has
	dropped out of the text (in M: the papyrus does not name the plays
	at all).
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]See the sections on [c dimgray]Edonians, Bassarids, Youths[/c] and
	[c dimgray]Lycurgus[/c] in Volume III.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]See M.L. West, [c dimgray]Greek Epic Fragments[/c] (Cambridge MA,
	2003) 4–10, 38–59.
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]Though when Sophocles—particularly in the earliest of
	his three plays, [c dimgray]Antigone[/c]—alludes to an episode of the story in a
	way that presupposes previous knowledge of it, he may well be assuming
	that his audience would fill in the gaps by recalling the
	fairly recent, and famous, production by Aeschylus; thus Ismene’s reference to her father’s “self-detected crimes” (αὐτοφώρων ἀμπλακημάτων, [c dimgray]Ant.[/c] 51) makes it likely that the Aeschylean, like
	the Sophoclean, Oedipus was himself responsible for discovering
	the truth about his parentage and/or about the murder of Laius.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 140[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Aeschylus[/b]
	the first two plays of Aeschylus’ production are very slight:
	from [c dimgray]Laius[/c] we have two single-word quotations (frr. 121,
	122), a tiny scrap of a papyrus Hypothesis ([c dimgray]Oxyrhynchus
	Papyrus[/c] 2256 fr. 1) which seems to indicate that Laius
	himself was the play’s opening speaker, and a statement
	(fr. 122a) that the play referred somewhere to a murderer
	who tasted and spat out his victim’s blood; from [c dimgray]Oedipus,[/c]
	nothing at all securely ascribed; and from one play or the
	other—but we do not know which—three lines (fr. 387a)
	of a messenger-speech referring to the murder of Laius
	and placing it at a road-junction at Potniae, just south of
	Thebes.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] We gain some further assistance, however, from
	backward references in [c dimgray]Seven against Thebes[/c] itself—particularly
	in the ode (720–791) in which the chorus review
	the entire course of events leading from Laius’ defiance
	of an oracular warning, through Oedipus’ marriage, self-blinding,
	and curse, to the impending death of his two
	grandsons at each other’s hands, and also in certain remarks
	by Eteocles, such as his reference (710–1, cf. 727–733)
	to a dream about the division of Oedipus’ property, a
	reference that would hardly be understood unless the audience
	already knew about this dream.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Since we know of no other murder but that of Laius to
	which fr. 122a could reasonably be taken to refer in a play
	that bore Laius’ name, we can safely assume that Laius’

	[c darkmagenta][b]AESCHYLUS, Seven against Thebes[/b][/c]
	[b]Aeschylus[/b]
	death (off stage, of course) was the main event of the first
	play. Since he was killed while on a journey (fr. 387a), he
	must have been given some reason for leaving Thebes. In
	Euripides’ [c dimgray]Phoenician Maidens[/c] (35–37) he is on his way to
	Delphi, and this version was not a new one, since Sophocles
	seems to presuppose it;[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] but Aeschylus cannot have
	used it, since he makes Laius head [c dimgray]southwards[/c]—towards
	Plataea, beyond which lie Megara and Corinth. We know
	that the exposure of Laius’ infant son was mentioned in the
	play (fr. 122) and so probably had some relevance to its
	plot: in Euripides Laius goes to Delphi to ask whether his
	son was still alive, and perhaps in Aeschylus the motive for
	his journey was the same but he was making for Corinth,
	having maybe heard a rumour that his son had been rescued
	and taken there. Meanwhile that son was himself on
	the way from Corinth to Thebes; we do not know the reason
	for his journey, and we cannot be sure that Aeschylus
	troubled to provide him with one.[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] And they met at
	Potniae.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Since [c dimgray]Laius[/c] contained a reference to Laius’ killer tasting
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c]All we are told explicitly in Sophocles is that Laius left
	Thebes as a θεωρός, i.e. on a religiously motivated mission of
	some sort ([c dimgray]Oedipus the King[/c] 114); but this term could be used of
	someone going to Delphi to inquire of the oracle ([c dimgray]Oedipus at
	Colonus[/c] 413), and it is hard to find another plausible destination
	for him that would account for his being on the particular road
	where the confrontation with Oedipus took place.
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]He probably did not appear on stage in [c dimgray]Laius[/c] (see below), so
	no one in Thebes will yet have known his intentions except to the
	extent that they could be inferred from his actions; and in [c dimgray]Oedipus[/c]
	the whole episode was far in the past, and a skilful composer of
	narrative would be able to pass lightly over details like this.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 142[/c]

	his blood (fr. 122a), it is likely that this was part of a full
	narrative of his murder;[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] and if so, it is a reasonable supposition
	that the messenger-speech from which fr. 387a
	comes belonged to this play rather than to the next. The
	news will have triggered lamentations, in the midst of
	which the body of Laius was probably brought back—
	much as in [c dimgray]Seven[/c] the bodies of the two brothers are
	brought back from the battlefield at 848 after the chorus
	have already begun singing laments for them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	According to Apollonius Rhodius (4.475–9), the tasting
	and spitting of a murder victim’s blood was particularly
	associated with treacherous killings (δολοκτασίαι) such
	as the ambush-murder (as Apollonius tells it) of Medea’s
	brother Apsyrtus; and the same source[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] which tells us that
	Aeschylus mentioned this custom in [c dimgray]Laius[/c] tells us that
	he mentioned it also in [c dimgray]Perrhaebian Women,[/c] evidently in
	connection with the exceptionally treacherous murder by
	Ixion of his father-in-law which we know to have been the
	subject of that play. If Laius’ killer was indeed said to have
	tasted his blood, the murder must have been presented
	very differently from any other version known to us—unless,
	as we hear retrospectively in Sophocles ([c dimgray]Oedipus the[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]There is only a very brief messenger-narrative of the brothers’
	killing of each other in [c dimgray]Seven,[/c] and none at all of the murders
	in [c dimgray]Agamemnon[/c] or [c dimgray]Libation-Bearers;[/c] but none of these slayings
	comes as a surprise to those on stage. In surviving tragedy, when
	(as in Sophocles’ [c dimgray]Antigone,[/c] or Euripides’ [c dimgray]Hippolytus[/c] or [c dimgray]Heracles[/c])
	an unnatural death or deaths occur which none of those who first
	learn of it had, as it were, seen approaching, it is always fully narrated.

	[c dimgray]King[/c] 118–123, 836–850), the survivor’s tale of the murder
	was in crucial respects false (doubtless to exonerate himself
	for having failed to protect his master) and he pretended
	that Laius had been ambushed by a gang of brigands.[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]

	It is not likely that either the arrival of Oedipus at

	[m1]\ [/m]
	For evidence regarding what may have happened in
	the second play of the trilogy, [c dimgray]Oedipus,[/c] we are almost entirely
	dependent on retrospective passages in [c dimgray]Seven[/c]—the
	reference by Eteocles, already mentioned, to a dream
	about the division of his father’s property (710–1), and the
	following passage from the choral ode after Eteocles’ final

	the ground that “such mistakes might seem more in place in the
	[c dimgray]Oedipus”;[/c] on the contrary, it is vital to the plot of the trilogy that
	the Thebans be led to suppose that the young Oedipus, who will
	soon arrive at Thebes, cannot possibly have any connection with
	the recent murder of their king not far from the city). The unusual
	device of a lying messenger-speech is used by Sophocles in [c dimgray]The

	he perpetrated two evils:
	by his own father-slaying hand
	he was robbed of his <  > eyes,
	and angered with his sons

	them
	(ah, ah!) the curses of a bitter tongue,
	that they would actually one day
	divide his property between them
	with iron-wielding hand.
	The statement that Oedipus perpetrated “two \[literally
	‘twin’\] evils” when he learned the truth about his marriage
	(and, presumably, learned more or less at the same time
	that he had killed his father) suggests that in Aeschylus’
	imagining of the story, the discovery and the self-blinding
	were followed quite closely by Oedipus’ curse on his sons.
	Moreover, Eteocles’ dream[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] ought to precede the curse:
	coming before the curse the dream would be enigmatic
	and ambiguous, coming after the curse it would tell
	Eteocles nothing that he had not been told already. This
	tends to suggest that dream, discovery, self-blinding and
	curse, probably in that sequence, all formed part of
	[c dimgray]Oedipus,[/c] though the dream, like that of the Queen in [c dimgray]Persians[/c]

	lots for the division of Oedipus’ property between his sons. The
	chorus, and perhaps Eteocles himself, in the end realize that the
	stranger is Iron (730, 817, 944), i.e. the sword.

	play began. We may add that if it is correct, as is done in
	this edition, to take τροφᾶς (786) as referring to the way
	Oedipus’ sons were maintaining their father,[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] Oedipus
	must already have been an old man who had “retired” from
	active life and entrusted the management of his household
	and city to his sons—who were failing to treat him with
	proper filial respect, even at a time when his reputation
	was still unblemished. We cannot tell how the discovery
	was effected, and we have no way of knowing what role, if
	any, Oedipus’ mother-wife played in the action.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If this outline reconstruction of [c dimgray]Oedipus[/c] is correct, it
	leaves little if any space in the play for events subsequent
	to Oedipus’ curse. Rather, the death of Oedipus, the quarrel
	between Eteocles and Polyneices, the expulsion of the
	latter from Thebes, his arrival at Argos, and the raising of
	Adrastus’ expedition against Thebes, must all be taken to
	fall in the undramatized interval between the actions of
	[c dimgray]Oedipus[/c] and of [c dimgray]Seven.[/c] The surviving play begins when
	Thebes has been under siege for some time, and the
	prophet Teiresias[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c] has declared that the day now commencing
	will see a major enemy assault on the city.

	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c]Rather than taking it, with Hutchinson, to refer to their incestuous
	birth. I discussed this question in [c dimgray]Hermes[/c] 117 (1989)
	440–5; to the arguments presented there it should be added that a
	scholium to Sophocles’ [c dimgray]Oedipus at Colonus[/c] (1375) says explicitly
	that Aeschylus’ treatment of Oedipus’ curse was “similar” to the
	story in the epic [c dimgray]Thebais[/c] (fr. 3 West) according to which he cursed
	his sons because they slighted him in the distribution of cuts of
	meat from a sacrifice.
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c]See note on 24. It is, of course, possible that Teiresias had
	been seen on stage in one or both of the preceding plays.

	light-hearted vein the story of the defeat and destruction
	of the Sphinx by Oedipus, see the relevant section of Volume
	III.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Towards the end of [c dimgray]Seven[/c] there are several passages of
	highly suspect authenticity.[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] The final scene, in which a
	herald forbids the burial of Polyneices, Antigone defies
	him, and the chorus divide in two, half escorting the body
	of one brother and half that of the other, ruins an ending
	which till then had stressed, over and over again, the
	equality of the brothers in death, and leaves the action of
	the play, and therefore of the trilogy, lacking any closure;
	at one point, moreover (1039, where see note), the text
	can hardly be understood without prior acquaintance
	with Sophocles’ [c dimgray]Antigone.[/c] It is overwhelmingly probable,
	therefore, that this scene was added for a restaging of
	[c dimgray]Seven,[/c] at a time when Sophocles’ play had made it impossible
	to think of the mutual slaughter of Eteocles and
	Polyneices without also thinking of the tragic heroism of
	their sister.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If that is the case, it becomes unlikely that Antigone and
	her sister Ismene (862) originally figured at all in a play
	whose later scenes otherwise emphasize the complete destruction
	of the house of Laius,[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c] and this is confirmed by
	the very clumsy way in which they are introduced in 861–
	874, with the chorus saying the sisters have evidently come
	to sing a lament and immediately adding, without any reason
	given, that they themselves, the chorus, ought to sing
	one first. Clearly the interpolator wanted to have the sisters

	sing the antiphonal lament 961–1004 (which Aeschylus
	doubtless wrote for sections, or section-leaders, of the
	chorus)[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] but did not want to bring them on immediately
	before it and so break up the continuous sequence of lyric
	lament. The removal of 861–874 allows the chorus’s lament
	over the bodies of the two brothers to begin immediately
	they have been brought on stage (a movement covered
	by 848–860).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The short anapaestic passage 822–831 may well also be
	an interpolation;[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] it contributes nothing to the reshaping
	of the ending consequent on the introduction into the play
	of Antigone and Ismene, and need not (though it may)
	have been composed at the same time as the other additions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As a result of these changes to the ending of [c dimgray]Seven[/c] we
	seem to have lost a few lines from the very conclusion of
	the play—though probably no more than a few: already
	in the last surviving genuine lines the question has been
	raised (1002) of where the brothers shall be buried, and it
	has been pointed out (1004) that it would be cruel to lay
	them near the father who had cursed them; once an alternative
	suggestion has been made and accepted, the chorus—all
	of it, not two halves separately as in the altered
	ending—can escort the two corpses to their final home,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]Except for 996–7, which suits only the sisters—and which is
	metrically incongruous in its context (two dochmiacs in a long
	epode which is otherwise entirely iambic) and contains a very dubious
	use of τὸ πρόσω to mean “also, additionally”; these two
	lines were probably inserted by the interpolator.

	I ask you, you insufferable creatures, is this the best policy,
	does it help save our city, does it give confidence to our beleaguered
	population, to fall down before the images of
	the city’s gods and cry and howl in a way any sensible person
	would abhor? Whether in trouble or in welcome prosperity,
	may I not share my home with the female gender!
	When a woman is in the ascendant, her effrontery is impossible
	to live with; when she’s frightened, she is an even
	greater menace to family and city. So now, with you running
	around in all directions like this, your clamour has
	spread panic and cowardice among the citizens; you are
	doing your very best to advance the cause of the enemy
	outside—the city is being sacked by its own people from
	within! That’s the sort of thing you’ll get if you live with
	women! Now then, if anyone fails to obey my command,
	whether a man or a woman or anything in between, a vote
	of death will be passed against them and there is no way
	they will escape execution by public stoning. Out-of-door
	affairs are the concern of men; women are not to offer
	opinions about them. Stay inside and do no harm!

	Affection\], and the god’s wife Agathe Tyche \[Good Fortune\]”.
	[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c]The reference is to sacrifices (σφάγια) offered immediately
	before going into battle; seeW. K. Pritchett, [c dimgray]The Greek State
	at War[/c] i (Berkeley, 1974) 109–15. However, the fact that such sacrifices,
	in the nature of the case, could only be offered by men in
	no way shows that it was not proper for the women of a besieged

	Eteocles in effect concedes this at 265–70 below.

	I can state from accurate knowledge the dispositions of the
	enemy, and how each has received his allotted station at
	the gates. Tydeus is already growling near the Proetid
	Gate, but the prophet[c dimgray][sup]50[/sup][/c] is not allowing him to cross the
	river Ismenus, because the sacrifices are not giving good
	signs. Tydeus, lusting madly for battle, is screaming like
	a snake hissing at midday,[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c] and is belabouring the wise
	prophet, the son of Oecles, with insults, saying that he is
	cringeing before death and battle through cowardice. As
	he utters these cries he shakes three crests casting long
	shadows, the mane of his helmet, and on the underside of
	his shield bells of beaten bronze make a terrifying clang.
	Fashioned upon his shield he bears this proud device: a
	blazing firmament, full of stars. Conspicuous in the centre
	of the shield is a brilliant full moon, the greatest of the
	stars, the eye of night. Raving thus, in his boastful armour,
	he screams by the banks of the river, longing for battle, like
	a horse panting against the force of bit and bridle and impatiently
	awaiting the sound of the trumpet. Whom will
	you station to oppose this man? Who can be relied on to
	stand before Proetus’ Gate when its bolts are undrawn?

	So indeed may the gods grant him good fortune! Capaneus
	has been allotted the position at the Electran Gate. This
	second one is a giant,[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c] bigger than the man previously
	mentioned,[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c] and his boasts show a pride beyond human
	limits; for he says that he will sack the city, god willing or
	unwilling, and that not even the weapons of Zeus crashing
	down to earth will stand in his way or hold him back—he
	compares the lightnings and thunderbolts to the heat of
	the noonday sun. As his device he bears a naked man carrying
	fire: the torch with which he is armed blazes in his
	hands, and in golden letters he declares “I will burn the

	Another, the fourth, assigned to the neighbouring Gate of
	Athena Onca, is standing near it uttering loud cries, the
	vast figure and form of Hippomedon. I shuddered, I won’t
	deny it, to see him brandish his great round threshing-floor
	of a shield. And it can’t have been a cheap artist who gave
	him that device on the shield, Typhon[c dimgray][sup]65[/sup][/c] emitting dark
	smoke, the many-coloured sister of flame, from his fire-breathing
	lips; the round circle of the hollow-bellied shield
	is floored with coiling snakes.[c dimgray][sup]66[/sup][/c] The man himself raised a
	great war-cry; he is possessed by Ares, and he rages for a
	fight like a maenad, with a fearsome look in his eye. You

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]65[/sup][/c]Typhon (also called Typhoeus or Typhos) was the last oppo- nent whom Zeus vanquished before his rulership of the universe
	was finally established (Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 821–68). He was an
	Earth-born monster, with a hundred fiery serpent-heads; but after
	a great battle Zeus defeated him with the thunderbolt and hurled
	him down to Tartarus (in Pindar, [c dimgray]Pythian[/c] 1.15–28, and in [c dimgray]Prometheus[/c]
	351–72, he lies under Mount Etna).
	[c dimgray][sup]66[/sup][/c]This expression is easily understood in the light of artistic
	representations of Typhon (including an Argive shield found at
	Olympia; see D. W. Berman, [c dimgray]Myth and Culture in Aeschylus’
	Seven against Thebes[/c] \[Rome, 2007\] 59–60 and figs. 1a, 1b), in
	which he regularly has one or two coiling snakes where his legs
	should be (see [c dimgray]LIMC[/c] s.v. Typhon).

	In the first place, Pallas Onca, close neighbour to our city’s
	gate, hates this man’s arrogance and will keep him off,
	like a mother-bird[c dimgray][sup]67[/sup][/c] protecting her nestlings from a hostile
	serpent. And a man has been chosen to face this man,
	Hyperbius, the brave son of Oenops, ready to learn his fate
	in this crisis of fortune, faultless in form, in spirit, and also
	in the handling of arms. And Hermes[c dimgray][sup]68[/sup][/c] has brought them
	together appropriately: the man is an enemy of the man
	he will face,[c dimgray][sup]69[/sup][/c] and on their shields they will bring together
	two antagonistic gods. One of them has the fire-breathing
	Typhon, and on Hyperbius’ shield resides Father Zeus,
	standing with his flaming bolt in his hand. Such are their
	alliances with gods; and we are on the side of the winners,
	they of the losers, that is if Zeus is Typhon’s superior in battle.
	It is to be expected that the human opponents will fare
	likewise, and by the logic of Hyperbius’ emblem the Zeus
	he has on his shield should become his Saviour.[c dimgray][sup]70[/sup][/c]

	“They \[the Athenians\] are under the wings of Pallas”.
	[c dimgray][sup]68[/sup][/c]Hermes was thought to be responsible for unexpected
	strokes of good luck.
	[c dimgray][sup]69[/sup][/c]It is not clear whether this means that the two men are personal
	enemies (if so, we know nothing of the mythical background)
	or whether the statement merely serves to point up what
	follows (“not only are these two men going to fight each other, they

	the adversary of Zeus, the unlovely form of an earth-born

	So may it be. Now I tell you of the fifth, assigned to the fifth
	gate, the North Gate, right by the tomb of Amphion,[c dimgray][sup]72[/sup][/c] son
	of Zeus. He stands there with a savage pride, not at all in
	keeping with his maidenish name,[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c] and a fierce eye. He
	swears by the spear he holds, resolved to revere it more
	than a god and more highly than his eyes, that he will sack
	the city of the Cadmeans by force. He who says this is the
	offspring of Ares by a mountain-dwelling mother,[c dimgray][sup]74[/sup][/c] a fair-faced
	man, little more than a boy: the down is just growing
	thick and spreading over his cheeks as he comes to the
	prime of beauty. But he does not stand before the gate
	without a boastful emblem: on his shield of beaten bronze,
	the circular protector of his body, he wielded our city’s
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]71[/sup][/c]lit. “throw”.
	[c dimgray][sup]72[/sup][/c]Who, together with his brother
	Zethus, built the walls of Thebes. The tomb was on a hill to the
	north of the Cadmea (see Berman [c dimgray]op.cit.[/c] 103 and map 4).
	[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Partheno[/c]-paeus.
	[c dimgray][sup]74[/sup][/c]His mother was the huntress
	Atalanta; his father is usually named as Melanion (occasionally
	Meleager), but \[Apollodorus\], [c dimgray]Library[/c] 3.9.2 gives Ares as an alternative.
	The transmitted text offers a very different construction
	and meaning: “. . . that he will sack the city of the Cadmeans in despite
	of Zeus: so says the offspring of (ἐξ) a mountain-dwelling
	mother . . .”. However, when a person’s mother is named with the
	preposition ἐκ (ἐξ), the father is normally also identified explicitly
	or implicitly; hence Weil’s conjecture.

	The sixth man I have to speak of is a man of the highest

	the prophet. Stationed before the Homoloïd Gate, he is
	casting many reviling words at powerful Tydeus—“murderer”,
	[c dimgray][sup]79[/sup][/c] “wrecker of your city”, “Argos’ great instructor in
	evil”, “arouser of a Fury”,[c dimgray][sup]80[/sup][/c] “high priest[c dimgray][sup]81[/sup][/c] of Carnage”,
	“Adrastus’ counsellor in these crimes”. And then again he

	and dwelling on its significance,[c dimgray][sup]82[/sup][/c] and these are the words
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]79[/sup][/c]Tydeus had fled from his native Calydon to Argos after killing
	one or more kinsmen (early accounts vary widely as to the details);
	like Polyneices, he married a daughter of Adrastus. Amphiaraus’
	ensuing words should not be taken to imply that Tydeus
	alone was the prime mover behind Adrastus’ decision to attack
	Thebes, since he also blames Polyneices for urging this course on
	Adrastus (585).
	[c dimgray][sup]80[/sup][/c]i.e. inciter of an act that will incur certain
	and terrible vengeance.
	[c dimgray][sup]81[/sup][/c]lit. “servant”; for the
	personification of Carnage (Φόνος) as a deity cf. Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c]
	228 and [c dimgray]Shield of Heracles[/c] 155.
	[c dimgray][sup]82[/sup][/c]Polyneices means
	“Much-strife”. The passage as transmitted is corrupt, and I suspect
	that several words that were originally annotations (Polyneices’
	name, δίς, and ἐν τελευτῇ) have been incorporated into
	the text; I have omitted these in the above translation.

	Now this is the seventh, at the Seventh Gate:[c dimgray][sup]91[/sup][/c] your own
	brother. I will tell what a fate and curse he prays may befall
	this city[c dimgray][sup]92[/sup][/c], sounding out a jubilant paean for its capture: to
	join battle with you, kill you, and die beside you, or else, if
	you survive, to punish you, as the one who degraded him
	and drove him out, in the same manner—by banishment.
	Such is the cry of powerful Polyneices, and he is calling on
	the ancestral gods of his fatherland to look favourably on
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]91[/sup][/c]Both Aeschylus and Euripides ([c dimgray]Phoenician Maidens[/c] 1104–40),
	in listing the Seven and the gates they attacked, give names to the first six gates but call the last simply “the seventh”. For Euripides
	this gate is of no particular importance (in his account no one
	is killed there), and he clearly regarded “Seventh” as its [c dimgray]name.[/c] In
	\[Apollodorus\], [c dimgray]Library[/c] 3.6.6, and Pausanias 9.8.4, what seems to
	be the same gate is called the Hypsistan; if “Seventh” was an alternative
	name for it, it may have been due to the presence nearby of
	a sanctuary of Apollo (cf. 800–1).
	[c dimgray][sup]92[/sup][/c]Polyneices actually wants to rule Thebes (647–8), not to destroy
	it, and even expects its gods to be his allies (639–41); but the
	Scout, like Amphiaraus (582–3), evidently assumes that if the enemy
	are victorious Polyneices will not be able to prevent them
	from sacking and burning the city (cf. 427, 434, 467, 531, 549).

	mastered by his own cherished, unwise counsels,[c dimgray][sup]109[/sup][/c]
	begot his own death,
	Oedipus the father-slayer,
	who sowed the sacrosanct soil
	of his mother, where he had been nurtured,
	and suffered a bloodstained progeny:
	it was mindless madness
	that brought that bridal couple[c dimgray][sup]110[/sup][/c] together.
	Now the sea, as it were, is bringing waves of trouble;
	the first one subsides, but it raises up another
	of triple strength, which breaks loudly
	around the very poop of the city;
	and for protection, in between,
	stretches the slim breadth of this wall.
	I fear lest together with the princes
	the city may be laid low.
	Fulfilled is the grievous reconciliation
	spoken of in the curse long ago:[c dimgray][sup]111[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]109[/sup][/c]Possibly this alludes to sexual desire (cf. Euripides, [c dimgray]Phoenician Maidens[/c] 21), but more likely to the desire for offspring which had prompted his initial rejection of the oracle’s warning
	(cf. previous note).
	[c dimgray][sup]110[/sup][/c]The bridegroom here is probably
	Laius rather than Oedipus: Oedipus had no way of knowing that
	he was marrying his mother (cf. 778–9; the story of his having
	been told by Apollo that he was destined to do so is unlikely to
	predate Sophocles), and “mindless madness” describes not inappropriately
	an act by Laius which has already been called ill-counselled,
	a transgression, and a defiance of Apollo.
	[c dimgray][sup]111[/sup][/c]This too (cf. 710–11) may refer to something said in
	[c dimgray]Oedipus[/c]; for the idea of the brothers’ death as their reconciliation,
	cf. 884–5, 908–9, 941.

	But here come Antigone and Ismene

	I think they will undoubtedly utter
	a lament for their brothers from their lovely
	deep bosoms; their grief merits it.
	But it is right that we, <having heard> the news first,
	should raise the unpleasing sound
	of the Fury’s hymn, and sing
	the hateful paean of Hades.
	Oh,
	you most unhappy in your brothers of all
	who bind a sash round their garments!

	Grieving has spread right through the city:

	does the soil that loved these men; their property

	that property over which a dreadful fate came to them,
	over which came strife and death as its end.

	With whetted hearts they parted

	who later avenged their fathers by capturing and destroying
	Thebes, and any allusion to them here would clash with the assumption,
	basic to the last third of this play, that the house of Laius
	is now extinct. Moreover, the first of two paraphrases offered by
	the scholia in M says merely “[c dimgray]others[/c] will have the property for

	[c dimgray][sup]137[/sup][/c]The noun λαχή can be taken as meaning either “an allotted

	[c dimgray][sup]143[/sup][/c]Equivalent to “Furies” (cf. 70). In the last lines of this antistrophe,
	for the battle at the gates between the Thebans and the
	Argives is substituted a battle between the House of Laius and the powers of destruction (the Curses, Ruin and the δαίμων) ending
	in decisive victory for the latter.
	[c dimgray][sup]144[/sup][/c]These brief responsive phrases may have been sung by
	individual voices from the two halves of the chorus. In the mss.
	they are mostly ascribed to Antigone and Ismene, and this was
	doubtless the intention of the producer who introduced these
	characters.
	[c dimgray][sup]145[/sup][/c]This implies a scenario like that narrated in Euripides,
	[c dimgray]Phoenician Maidens[/c] 1404–22: brother A gives B a mortal wound,
	but B with his last strength kills A.

	[c dimgray][sup]146[/sup][/c]This probably refers to Eteocles, who had gone out of the
	city to fight his brother; in the next line the reference is to Polyneices’
	return from Argos.
	[c dimgray][sup]147[/sup][/c]Textual corruption makes
	the exact meaning of this line wholly uncertain.
	[c dimgray][sup]148[/sup][/c]τρίπαλτος (which occurs only here) ought etymologically
	to mean something like “thrice brandished”, referring to a
	weapon; it may possibly refer to the three generations of suffering
	in the house of Laius (cf. 742ff), which have been enacted in the
	three plays of the trilogy.

	are appropriate only to Antigone and Ismene: “But above all to me.—And even more to me.” They will have been inserted when
	the sisters were brought into the play; evidently (and rightly) the
	adaptor felt that it would be absurd to have the sisters sing a sobbing
	antiphon like 961–1004 and yet make no reference whatever
	to their personal grief.
	[c dimgray][sup]152[/sup][/c]The language irresistibly suggests that to bury Eteocles
	and Polyneices close to their father would be to inflict on him the
	same kind of injury that he inflicted on [c dimgray]his[/c] father (to whom he
	gave pain, and whose bed he unknowingly usurped). Since the
	first suggestion as to where the brothers should be buried has thus
	been (at least provisionally) rejected, Aeschylus’ text cannot have
	ended here: once the question of their burial-place has been
	raised, the bodies cannot be taken off until it has been settled.

	I have to announce the opinion and the decision of the
	people’s council of this city of Cadmus. It has been resolved
	that Eteocles here, on account of his loyalty to his
	country, shall be buried in the loving recesses of the earth;
	for he found death while keeping out the enemy at the
	gates, and in pious defence of the temples of his fathers he
	has died blamelessly where it is honourable for the young
	to die. That is what I have been instructed to say about
	him; but his brother, the dead Polyneices here, is to be cast
	out unburied, a prey for the dogs, as one who would have
	been the destroyer of the land of Cadmus, had not some
	god stood up to hinder his armed attack. Even in death he
	shall bear the pollution and curse of his ancestral gods,
	whom he insulted when he tried to capture the city, bringing
	a foreign army to attack it. So it is decided that he
	should get his due reward by receiving a dishonourable funeral
	from the flying birds; that he should neither lie under
	a laboriously raised burial-mound[c dimgray][sup]153[/sup][/c] nor be dignified with
	high-pitched musical wailings; and that he should not have
	the honour of a funeral procession from his family. Such is

	It has long been universally accepted that [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] was
	part of a sequence of plays that also contained [c dimgray]Danaids[/c],
	which likewise had the daughters of Danaus as its chorus
	and which, as fr. 43 showed, presented a later stage of their
	story, being set on the day after their marriage to their
	cousins, the sons of Aegyptus, and the murder of all but
	one of the bridegrooms by their unwilling brides. The
	other play of the trilogy has almost always been identified
	as [c dimgray]Egyptians[/c] (despite the fact that only one word of that
	play survives),
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] since the Danaid story is intimately bound
	up with Egypt and no other Aeschylean tragedy is known
	to have had any significant connection with that country;
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	whether it preceded or followed [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] was, and is,
	disputed (see below). The satyr-drama that wound up the
	production, if (as was normal) it dealt with another section
	of the same myth, had to be [c dimgray]Amymone[/c], whose title character
	was one of the Danaids; but until 1952, it was not

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Even Hermann, who thought that the other play was

	that same drama. In fact [c dimgray]Chamber-makers[/c] was probably a satyr-play;
	see the section on it in Volume III.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The only Aeschylean play, outside the Danaid group, that [c dimgray]is[/c]
	known to have had a significant connection with Egypt is [c dimgray]Proteus[/c],

	at all.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Until 1952, also, it was generally taken as all but certain
	that [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] was the earliest of Aeschylus’ surviving
	plays and therefore the oldest known European drama:
	the active role of the chorus, the dominance of song (more
	than half the text is sung or chanted), the apparent presence
	of two singing subsidiary choruses (Egyptians in 825–
	865, Argive soldiers or the Danaids’ maidservants in 1034–

	and slightness of the plot, all seemed to point in that
	direction.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In 1952 [c dimgray]Oxyrhynchus Papyrus[/c] 2256 was published.
	One of its many fragments (fr. 3) comes from a Hypothesis
	giving information about the result of the City Dionysia
	tragic competition in a particular year; we cannot identify
	the year for sure, since all that is left of the date-rubric is
	ἐπὶ α\[ and the last two letters of that might be the beginning
	of the archon’s name or merely (as apparently in fr. 2
	of the same papyrus, a Hypothesis to [c dimgray]Laius[/c])
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] the beginning
	of the name of his office (ἄρ\[χοντος\]). The papyrus then
	goes on to say that Aeschylus was victorious with a production
	which included, as its third and fourth plays, [c dimgray]Danaids[/c]
	and the satyr-drama [c dimgray]Amymone[/c]; Sophocles was second, and
	one Mesatus was third. Mesatus’ name was followed by a
	series of play-titles, some of which are enclosed in brackets;
	the likeliest explanation
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] is that the bracketed titles belong

	of place) and the remainder to Mesatus.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now unless we resort to some desperate suppositions,
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]
	this evidence proves that the Danaid tetralogy was written
	to be performed at a festival at which Sophocles was also
	competing. Sophocles won his first victory in 468;
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] according
	to Plutarch
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] this was the first time he had competed,
	but Eusebius’ chronicle, both in Jerome’s and in the Armenian
	version, says he first came before the public in the second
	year of the 77th Olympiad—which would mean the
	City Dionysia of 470—and Plutarch, or his source, is under
	considerable suspicion of having improved the story to
	make Sophocles’ defeat of the established master Aeschylus
	a more sensational event.
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] We can say, then, that the
	Danaid plays were almost certainly produced between 470
	and 459 inclusive, and probably not in the last few years of
	this period in view of the absence from the setting of [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c]
	of any house, cave, etc., which could be represented
	by a [c dimgray]skēnē.[/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] Were it certain that the letters α\[ in
	the first line of the papyrus were the beginning of the
	archon’s name, we could date the production more precisely
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]Such as that the Hypothesis refers to a posthumous production,
	or that the tetralogy was not produced until many years after
	it was written.

	to 463, the only relevant year with an archon whose
	name (Archedemides) matches these letters; but it is not
	certain, or even very probable.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The story of the Danaids exists in dozens of variants.
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]
	Their common core is that a quarrel between the brothers
	Danaus and Aegyptus, great-grandsons of Zeus and Io of
	Argos, leads to Danaus and his fifty daughters
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] fleeing
	from Egypt to Argos, their ancestral home, pursued by
	Aegyptus
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] and his fifty sons, who desired to take their
	cousins in marriage regardless of the Danaids’ or their
	father’s wishes. The conflict is seemingly resolved when
	Danaus agrees to the marriages taking place, but he secretly
	supplies weapons to his daughters, and all but one of
	them kill their bridegrooms on the wedding night. The
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]Set out in full by Friis Johansen and Whittle in the introduction
	to their edition (pp. 40–55); see also Gantz 198–208.
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]When [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] was thought to be a very early play, it was
	often suggested that its chorus actually numbered fifty. There was
	never any justification for this. If in a Euripidean play of the 420s
	(coincidentally of the same name) a conventional tragic chorus of
	fifteen can represent a group who are repeatedly described as the
	mothers of the [c dimgray]Seven[/c] against Thebes (Euripides, [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] 12–
	13, 100–2, etc.) and even as “seven mothers of seven sons” ([c dimgray]ib.[/c]
	963–4), it cannot be seriously doubted that several decades earlier
	it would have been possible for a conventional chorus of (as it then
	was) twelve to represent a group of fifty.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]That Aegyptus came to Argos together with his sons was
	“the most frequent account” according to Euripides (fr. 846, cf.
	[c dimgray]Orestes[/c] 872); the scholia on [c dimgray]Orestes[/c] 872 say that Aeschylus’ tragic
	predecessor, Phrynichus, had Aegyptus accompany his sons to
	Argos, and their silence about Aeschylus himself suggests that
	Aeschylus did not follow Phrynichus in this respect.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 280[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Aeschylus[/b]
	survivor, Lynceus, in many versions seeks and gains revenge
	upon Danaus; at any rate, he and his wife, Hypermestra,
	regularly become the founders of a new royal line
	of Argos and the ancestors of such heroes as Perseus and
	Heracles. Hypermestra’s sisters are in some versions punished
	(sometimes eternally), in others new husbands are
	found for them.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] only covers one small section of this story—
	the arrival and reception of the Danaids and their father at
	Argos, and the Argive refusal of a demand for their surrender,
	resulting in a declaration of war by the herald speaking
	in the name of the sons of Aegyptus. Its references to earlier
	events are scanty and vague (we are told far more
	about Io than we ever are about the past history of Danaus,
	his brother and their families), and while some things said
	in [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] are clearly designed to foreshadow the coming
	mass-murder,
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] hardly any further information about
	Aeschylus’ treatment of the later part of the story can be
	safely inferred from the text of the surviving play. As a result
	of this, and of the survival of only two significant fragments
	from the companion tragedies, we cannot even say
	with confidence whether [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] was the first or the
	second play of its trilogy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The third play, as was generally accepted even before
	the papyrus confirmed it, was [c dimgray]Danaids.[/c] We know two
	things about this play, apart from the obvious fact that,

	as ἐγχειριδίοις (21), literally “things held in the hand” but
	in ordinary usage “daggers”; or their father’s injunction to them to
	“value . . . chastity more than life itself” (1013), not specifying
	[c dimgray]whose[/c] life they should value less.

	[c darkmagenta][b]AESCHYLUS, Suppliants[/b][/c]
	[b]Aeschylus[/b]
	very unusually, the Danaids formed the chorus for the second
	time in the trilogy. One is that it began on the morning
	after the fatal weddings: fr. 43, while corrupt, clearly
	refers to the rising of the sun and to the ceremonial, musical
	“awakening” of the bridal couples. The other is that,
	doubtless later in the play, Aphrodite appeared and made a
	speech which contained an eloquent affirmation of the
	universality of mutual sexual desire in nature with particular
	reference to the primal union of Heaven and Earth (fr.
	44)—clearly with a view to vindicating Hypermestra, or
	to condemning Danaus,
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] or both, but certainly also to
	condemning the sons of Aegyptus who, in the surviving
	play, are represented—by their own herald as much as by
	their enemies—as unilaterally demanding the satisfaction
	of their own desires regardless of anyone else’s.
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] It would
	be highly fitting if this were followed up by the marriage of
	the Danaids other than Hypermestra to new husbands
	with whom they [c dimgray]could[/c] form a union as true as that of
	Heaven and Earth; and it is likely too that before the end
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c]It is fairly clear that in Aeschylus’ treatment, Danaus was
	presented as the inspirer of his daughters’ actions; they themselves
	call him “the originator of our plan, the leader of our band,
	\[who,\] surveying the situation like a gameboard, ordained \[that we
	should\] flee headlong over the waves of the sea” (11–14).
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c]“You may take these women,” says King Pelasgus to the herald,
	“so long as they consent with friendly heart, if pious words of
	yours should persuade them” (940–1); and the herald regards this
	insistence on consent as a [c dimgray]casus belli[/c] (950)!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 282[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Aeschylus[/b]
	of this play Danaus had met his death.
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c] The rest is speculation.
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What of [c dimgray]Egyptians[/c]? It has usually been supposed that
	this was the second play of the trilogy, in which case its subject
	must have been the events leading from the conclusion
	of the Argive-Egyptian war (in which, it is generally
	accepted, King Pelasgus must have been killed, with
	Danaus perhaps taking over as a quasi-tyrant)
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c] to the arrangement
	and celebration of the marriages between
	Danaus’ daughters and Aegyptus’ sons. There are, however,
	serious difficulties with this view, which I have set out
	elsewhere:
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]

	The title . . . implie\[s\] a chorus of Egyptians . . . . In
	that case it \[is\] at first sight hard to see how Danaos
	and his daughters could have contrived their murder-plot.
	Various possibilities, indeed, \[exist\]: perhaps
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c]In the scholium on [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] 37, διὰ τὸ μὴ θανατωθῆναι
	τὸν πατέρα “because their father has not (sc. at this time) been
	put to death” (on the meaning of the phrase see A. F. Garvie,
	[c dimgray]Aeschylus’ Supplices[/c]
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] \[Exeter, 2005\] xviii-xix), the use of
	θανατωθῆναι rather than e.g.τεθνηκέναι strongly suggests the
	writer knew that Danaus was in fact put to death later in the trilogy.
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c]On the possible reconstruction of [c dimgray]Danaids[/c], see further my
	discussions in B. Zimmermann ed. [c dimgray]Griechisch-römische Komödie
	und Tragödie[/c] (Stuttgart, 1995) 123–130, and in [c dimgray]Aeschylean Tragedy[/c]
	147–151.
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c]His acquisition of a personal bodyguard towards the end of
	[c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] (985–8) may reasonably be taken as foreshadowing
	this.

	[b]Aeschylus[/b]
	the play, like Aristophanes’ [c dimgray]Frogs[/c], was named
	after a secondary chorus, the Danaids being the
	main chorus; perhaps the plot was so familiar a part
	of the story that the dramatist took the audience’s
	knowledge of it for granted, and exploited it to
	ironic effect in scenes of negotiation between
	Danaos and his enemies. But \[neither\] of these expedients
	seem\[s\] fully satisfactory.
	The alternative view, supported by several nineteenth-century
	scholars but revived in recent times by Wolfgang
	Rösler and myself,
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] is that [c dimgray]Egyptians[/c] was the [c dimgray]first[/c] play of
	the trilogy, was set in Egypt (with a chorus of male Egyptians,
	perhaps elders), and presented the quarrel between
	Danaus and Aegyptus. This view has won relatively little
	support, perhaps because both Rösler and I put the main
	stress in our arguments on a six-word scholium on [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c]
	37 which we took, following Martin Sicherl,
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] as evidence
	that Aeschylus imagined Danaus to have received
	an oracle that he would be killed by his daughter’s bedfellow
	(so that he was determined at all costs to keep his
	daughters permanently virgin), but which A. F. Garvie
	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c]
	has shown that we misinterpreted. This does not, however,
	in itself disprove the hypothesis that [c dimgray]Egyptians[/c] was the
	first play of the trilogy, which does not depend solely on
	this piece of evidence; nor does it prove that Aeschylus
	did not use the oracle story, since, again, there is other

	evidence suggesting that he did. In [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] 1006–9
	Danaus appears to be saying that the whole object of the
	flight from Egypt had been to preserve his daughters’ virginity
	not just from their cousins but absolutely—an idea
	that to any Greek would be utterly incomprehensible except
	in the light of the oracle story or something very like
	it.
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c] And since the oracle is nowhere mentioned in [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c],
	the surviving play, as Rösler insisted, cannot have
	stood first in the trilogy. We cannot argue against this that
	the oracle was so regular and familiar a part of the myth
	that the audience’s knowledge of it could be taken for
	granted, for we know that in one quite recent poetic version
	of the myth Danaus actually survived to arrange the
	remarriage of his daughters.
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c] I thus remain of the view
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c]It was considered a great wrong against a woman if her father
	or guardian deliberately kept her unmarried; this is regularly
	mentioned as one of the grievances of Electra against Aegisthus
	(and Clytaemestra), and when Lysias is describing the crimes of
	the Thirty who ruled Athens in 404–403, he climaxes his indictment
	not with their execution of hundreds of citizens without
	trial, but with a claim that they prevented many men’s daughters
	from being married (Lysias 12.21). Other than Danaus and
	Aegisthus, the only major mythical character who acts similarly is
	Acrisius, who walls up his daughter Danaë because an oracle has
	told him he will be killed by his grandson (the story appears first in
	Aeschylus’ contemporary Pherecydes \[[c dimgray]FGrH[/c] 3 F 10\]).
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c]Pindar, [c dimgray]Pythian[/c] 9.112–6 (performed in 474). Pindar may
	well be alluding to a version of the myth in which Danaus and
	Lynceus were reconciled, as in \[Apollodorus\], [c dimgray]Library[/c] 2.1.5
	(which repeats Pindar’s story of the selection of the new bridegrooms
	by means of a foot-race).

	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c]P. Sandin, [c dimgray]Aeschylus’ Supplices: Introduction and Commentary
	on vv.1–523[/c] (Göteborg, 2003) 9–11, argues that this sequence
	would entail that “the entire dramatic conflict that leads to
	. . . the wedding-night murder would be \[merely\] recounted in a
	prologue”; some might feel, contrariwise, that a play standing between
	[c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] and [c dimgray]Danaids[/c], and leading up to (but not including)
	the murders, would be singularly lacking in “dramatic conflict”,
	since the only action it would need to contain, once Pelasgus
	was removed from the scene, would be for Danaus to make peace
	proposals to his nephews that included acceptance of their marriage
	to his daughters, to have them accepted, and somehow to
	plot with his daughters the murder of their bridegrooms. There
	would be nothing surprising in important events of a myth being
	consigned, as it were, to the gap between two plays of
	an Aeschylean trilogy: the trilogy based on the [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] seems
	to have jumped straight from Odysseus’ visit to the underworld

	of our ancestress the flower-browsing cow, conceived by
	a breath,
	the fruit of Zeus’ touch
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]—and the destined time
	appropriately fulfilled
	the name derived from that touch,
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] and she gave birth
	to Epaphus;
	and now, by making mention of him
	here in the ancient grazing-grounds
	of his mother, and recalling
	her long-past sufferings, I shall now produce
	reliable proof, which, unexpected as it is, the land’s
	inhabitants will find clear;
	it will be recognized, once explained at length.
	If there happens to be any native nearby
	skilled in augury who hears my lament,
	he will think he is hearing a voice like that

	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]If the text here is rightly restored and understood, it implies
	that at the time of Epaphus’ conception Zeus told Io (as Gabriel told Mary) that she would bear a child and what name he should
	be given.
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]The wife of Tereus (with or without the aid of
	her sister) killed their only child, Itys. In early versions of the story
	the killing may have been accidental (as in the parallel story of [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c]
	19.518–523, Pherecydes [c dimgray]FGrH[/c] 3 F 124, where the husband
	is Zethus); in Sophocles’ later [c dimgray]Tereus[/c] it is a deliberate act of revenge
	for Tereus’ rape of his wife’s sister; in our passage it could be
	either. Both husband and wife were transformed into birds, the
	latter into a nightingale (who continues eternally to lament for
	Itys), the former into a hawk (in Sophocles a hoopoe). The wife’s
	name in archaic art, and in Pherecydes [c dimgray]loc.cit.[/c], is Aëdon or Aëdona
	(“Nightingale”); in Sophocles and thereafter it is Procne.

	the prospect of marriage with me makes it bloom

	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]Cf. Xenophanes fr. 25, 26 D-K: “\[God\] moves everything by

	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]i.e. the sons of Aegyptus.
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c]West’s conjecture, which I render here, is based on the par- allel of [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 218–223, where Agamemnon is said to have had his

	determination to sacrifice Iphigenia.
	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c]A name for Argos (cf. [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 256–7), explained in 260–270 below;
	by its similarity to Ἆπις, the Egyptian bull-god sometimes
	identified with Epaphus (cf. Herodotus 2.153), it suggests a link
	between Argos and Egypt, just as βοῦ-νιν “hilly land” suggests a
	link with the bovine Io.
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c]Although, in accordance with the conventions of tragedy,
	the words that actually come out of the Danaids’ mouths are
	Greek, we are expected to imagine that they are speaking Egyptian
	(just as e.g. we are expected to imagine that the performers’

	[c dimgray][sup]41[/sup][/c]The image of Zeus apparently has an eagle perching on its
	head or hand (cf. Aristophanes, [c dimgray]Birds[/c]514–5); the Egyptian god Amun-Re, whom Greeks identified with Zeus, was often portrayed
	as, or with the head of, a hawk which represented the sun
	(see E. M. Hall, [c dimgray]Inventing the Barbarian[/c] \[Oxford, 1989\] 144–6).
	Aeschylus and his audience evidently knew about the Egyptian
	sun-bird, and may well have been misled by the identification of
	Amun-Re with Zeus into supposing that the bird was an eagle:
	later sources (Diodorus Siculus 1.87.9, Strabo 17.1.40) say that in
	Thebes (the greatest centre of Amun’s cult) the eagle was worshipped.

	there is another Zeus who pronounces final judgement on

	So far as that is concerned, you can answer and speak to me
	with confidence. I am Pelasgus, ruler of this city, son of

	be relied on to render assistance to citizens of State B residing

	[c dimgray][sup]47[/sup][/c]sc. about your origins; the Greek means literally “only in
	that respect will ‘the Greek land’ be in agreement with a guess”.
	[c dimgray][sup]48[/sup][/c]This is in effect a counter-question about Pelasgus’ attire,
	which (despite his sceptre, which the Danaids think may be a “sacred
	staff”) is evidently too plain, by their standards, for them to
	be sure that he is a king.

	[c dimgray][sup]50[/sup][/c] and the parts beyond

	what is on the hither side of these. The soil of this land itself,
	Apia, received its name long ago in honour of a healer.
	Apis the healer and seer, son of Apollo, came from the land
	of Naupactus across the sea,
	[c dimgray][sup]52[/sup][/c] and cleansed this land of the
	man-destroying creatures which the angry earth, stained
	by the pollution of old bloodshed, had sent up from below,
	a hostile horde of serpents sharing our home. From these
	Apis effected, beyond all cavil, a decisive,
	[c dimgray][sup]53[/sup][/c] liberating cure
	for the Argive land, and in return won as his reward the
	right to be remembered in prayers. Now you have the

	[c dimgray][sup]50[/sup][/c]The Paeonians were a non-Greek tribe living in western
	Thrace and eastern Macedonia.
	[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c]In the fifth century Perrhaebia was the name of a district in
	north-eastern Thessaly (Herodotus 7.128.1, Thucydides 4.78.5–
	6); but in the [c dimgray]Iliad[/c] (2.749–750) the Per(rh)aebi live “near
	Dodona”, and Sophocles (fr. 271) places them near Mounts
	Pindus and Lacmus, which separate Thessaly on the east from
	Epirus on the west and in which rise tributaries of those regions’
	major rivers, the Peneus ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 2.751–5) and the Achelous (Soph.

	[c dimgray][sup]68[/sup][/c]I translate a restoration considered, but not adopted, by

	gives the sense “Who ever supposed that there would land at
	Argos, on this unforeseen flight, a former family connection, fluttered
	into a change of location by hatred of marriage?” (West,
	[c dimgray]Studies[/c] 142); but κῆδος normally means “family connection
	[c dimgray]through marriage[/c]” and is the last term the Danaids would use to
	describe the [c dimgray]blood[/c] kinship with the Argives which they have just

	ἐγγενές “a kindred marriage alliance” precisely describes the
	marriage to their cousins from which they are fleeing.
	[c dimgray][sup]69[/sup][/c]i.e. are you saying that the Aegyptiads are demanding something

	[c dimgray][sup]70[/sup][/c]For this equation of marriage with slavery cf. Euripides,

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]71[/sup][/c]The Danaids have in effect rejected the principle of Greek
	social organization that marriage is the transfer of a woman, object-like,
	from one family to another; Pelasgus replies with the
	conventional wisdom—that arranged marriages enable families to
	build up alliances and strengthen their social position.
	[c dimgray][sup]72[/sup][/c]i.e. a marriage alliance between two families gives no security
	to the weaker, since the stronger can easily repudiate it.
	[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c]The poop, where the steersman stood, was the most vital
	part of the ship (cf. [c dimgray]Seven[/c] 2); and this shrine, claim the Danaids, is
	the most vital spot in Argos—all the more so now it has been “garlanded”
	with their suppliant-boughs. There is an allusion to the
	garlanding of the sterns of ships on sacred missions (cf. Plato,
	[c dimgray]Phaedo[/c] 58a-c).

	I shudder to see this divine abode in shadow:
	[c dimgray][sup]74[/sup][/c] the wrath of

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]chorus[/b][/c]

	Son of Palaechthon, hear me
	with a gracious heart, lord of the Pelasgians.
	See me, the suppliant, the wandering fugitive,
	like a heifer chased by a wolf up
	the steep rocks, where,
	trusting to their protection, she lows loudly,
	letting the herdsman know of her peril.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]pelasgus[/b][/c]
	I see this company, shaded by fresh-plucked boughs, supplicating
	in the name of these Assembled Gods. May the
	business of these citizen-strangers
	[c dimgray][sup]75[/sup][/c] not prove ruinous,
	and may this event, never expected or planned for, not
	bring strife to the community: the city doesn’t need that!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]chorus[/b][/c]

	May the Right that protects suppliants, servant

	[c dimgray][sup]77[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]74[/sup][/c]Cf. 354–5 below.
	[c dimgray][sup]75[/sup][/c]The Danaids are ἀστόξενοι because, though foreigners (ξέναι) inasmuch as they have come to Argos from abroad and are
	of alien appearance, they are citizens (ἀσταί) by descent.
	[c dimgray][sup]76[/sup][/c]Or “daughter”; the Greek text merely describes Right
	(Themis) as “of Zeus”. In the twenty-third [c dimgray]Homeric Hymn[/c], and in
	Pindar, [c dimgray]Olympian[/c] 8.21–22, Themis is said to sit close to Zeus (cf.
	Dike in Aesch. fr. 281a.10).
	[c dimgray][sup]77[/sup][/c]This title of Zeus is otherwise known only from Tegea
	(Pausanias 8.53.9) where, perhaps significantly, it is associated
	with “the elevated place on which stand most of the Tegeans’ altars”.
	Alternatively, it may here be an alternative designation of
	Zeus as god of suppliants (Hikesios); suppliants’ boughs could
	apparently be called κλάριοι (cf. Hesychius κ2870).

	The judgement is not easy to judge: don’t choose me to
	judge it. I have already said I am not prepared to do this
	without the people’s approval, even though I have the
	power, lest if something not too good should happen the
	people may end by saying “By giving privileges to foreigners
	you destroyed our city”.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]chorus[/b][/c]

	Zeus, god of kindred, watches over these things
	in both directions, ready to lean either way,
	appropriately assigning
	to the wicked their wrongs, to the law-abiding their acts
	of piety.
	[c dimgray][sup]82[/sup][/c]
	If these things are weighed fairly, how could you come
	to regret it
	if you do what is right?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]pelasgus[/b][/c]
	Deep thought is certainly needed to save us: the eye, like
	that of a diver, must scan right to the bottom—a clear-sighted
	eye, not one unduly fogged by wine—so that this

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]81[/sup][/c]lit. “I define my remedy for a hateful marriage <to be flight
	up to the stars.”
	[c dimgray][sup]82[/sup][/c]This may formally mean no more than that Zeus weighs up,
	or keeps an account of, men’s good and evil deeds, but it certainly
	implies that he will eventually reward or punish them.

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]83[/sup][/c]The “booty” that Battle may seize (or destroy) will consist in
	Argive lives and possibly the city itself (cf. 401).
	[c dimgray][sup]84[/sup][/c]In general, ἀλάστορες (avenging spirits) tend to be thought
	of as a vague plurality, and one speaks of “an ἀλάστωρ” (e.g. [c dimgray]Pers.[/c]
	354; Euripides, [c dimgray]Hippolytus[/c] 820) or of the ἀλάστωρ of a particular person or act (e.g. [c dimgray]Ag[/c]. 1501; Sophocles, [c dimgray]Oedipus at Colonus[/c] 788).
	Here, however Ἀλάστωρ seems to be spoken of as an individual
	divine person. The pattern of usage of Ἐρινύ(ε)ς is quite similar,
	and Erinyes (Furies) too are said to pursue their victims even
	beyond death ([c dimgray]Eum[/c]. 175–8, 339–340).
	[c dimgray][sup]85[/sup][/c]Greek πρόξενος (cf. on 239).
	[c dimgray][sup]86[/sup][/c]Elsewhere in the play the Danaids make it quite clear that
	they fled from Egypt by their own and/or their father’s choice; it is
	an “expulsion” only in the sense that they could not have remained
	there without accepting the marriages they abhor.

	is that he is implying that in asking him to fight a war on their

	(Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 869–880). The mention of these calm waters
	recalls the Danaids’ own storm-free voyage (134–7) and, by contrast,
	their prayer that their pursuers be overwhelmed and

	[c dimgray][sup]135[/sup][/c]One of the functions of Artemis was to protect women in

	onwards, Hecate, originally a distinct goddess (cf. Hesiod,
	[c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 411–452), was often identified with Artemis; the relevance
	of such an identification here may be that one of Hecate’s

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]142[/sup][/c]The reference is to a set of fundamental ethical principles
	sometimes called the “unwritten laws”, nearly always three in
	number; these are variously formulated in our sources, but in Aeschylus
	(cf. [c dimgray]Eum.[/c] 269–272, 538–548), perhaps under Eleusinian
	influence (see my edition of Aristophanes’ [c dimgray]Frogs[/c] \[Warminster, 1996\], comm. on 145–153), they prescribe the giving of due
	honour to gods (704–6), to ξένοι (701–3), and to parents. The
	Danaids have prayed that the Argives may give due honour to
	ξένοι and to the gods, but they do not pray for them to respect

	You can’t send out a naval expedition quickly, and you can’t

	stern cables ashore to keep the ship safe,
	[c dimgray][sup]153[/sup][/c] and their
	custodians
	[c dimgray][sup]154[/sup][/c] don’t immediately feel secure when they’ve
	dropped anchor, especially when they’ve come to a
	harbourless coast as the sun is departing and night approaching—
	night tends to breed travail in the mind of an
	expert helmsman. So even to land an army
	[c dimgray][sup]155[/sup][/c] would not be
	a good idea until the fleet was secure in its anchorage. But
	as you’re afraid, be sure not to forget the gods; <I will come

	[c dimgray][sup]151[/sup][/c]The wolf was an emblem of Argos, and appears regularly

	[c dimgray][sup]152[/sup][/c]It was actually the root and lower stalk of the papyrus plant

	[c dimgray][sup]153[/sup][/c]Danaus assumes that the ships will cast anchor in water of
	sufficient depth and then moor themselves with long cables from
	the stern (cf. e.g. [c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 1.436, [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 10.95–96). See Morrison

	[c dimgray]A band of Egyptians[/c] rush in, led by a herald. The text is
	badly defective, but the egyptians’ first utterance
	[c dimgray][sup]163[/sup][/c] appears
	to be a cry of triumph—ho ho ho, ha ha ha! [c dimgray](825)—
	on finding their prey; from the following lines there survive
	the words[/c] I am the seizer [c dimgray](826)[/c], on the ship [c dimgray](826a) and[/c] on
	the land [c dimgray](826b), after which there was probably another
	line in which they declared their intention of taking the
	Danaids to their ship. The chorus[/c] reply Before that,
	seizer, may you wear away—yugh!
	[c dimgray][sup]164[/sup][/c]
	[c dimgray](827). Of their next
	line (828) there survive two letters which may be part of
	the word for eye and, after a gap, the phrase[/c] going down
	straight away; [c dimgray]possibly they are telling the Egyptians to get
	out of their sight and go straight back down to their ship.
	They then (829) say something which the scholia interpret
	as “No longer as having heard from my father, but seeing
	with my own eyes, I shout”; the line in M seems to have begun
	with now and its end can be plausibly restored as[/c] with
	knowledge I raise a cry. [c dimgray]The next line (830) is syntactically

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]160[/sup][/c]It is tolerably certain, on the evidence of the scholia, that
	the now corrupt text here had to do with “release” and “freedom
	from troubles”, but its exact wording and syntax cannot be restored.
	[c dimgray][sup]161[/sup][/c]The addressee is Zeus, not Danaus.
	[c dimgray][sup]162[/sup][/c]In which Zeus decides the fate of mortals (as in [c dimgray]Iliad[/c]
	22.209–212 and in Aeschylus’ [c dimgray]Weighing of Souls[/c]).
	[c dimgray][sup]163[/sup][/c]It is probably they who speak (or rather sing) first, not the
	Danaids; see West, [c dimgray]Studies[/c] 152–4.
	[c dimgray][sup]164[/sup][/c]Greek ἰόφ, according
	to the scholia an onomatopoeic expression of disgust.

	and form a plan. He should first

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]196[/sup][/c]i.e. in accommodation reserved for you alone (rather than
	being shared “with many others”). Without Burges’ transposition,
	neither the audience nor the Danaids would be clear how many
	and what options were being offered for them to choose between;
	in fact there are just two (cf. 1009–11)—non-exclusive accommodation
	in public dwellings, or exclusive accommodation in the
	palace or another building owned by the king. No doubt we will
	discover, later in the trilogy, that Danaus has chosen the latter, which will minimize contact between his daughters and ordinary
	Argives and, in due course, facilitate the wedding-night murders.
	See P. Sandin, [c dimgray]Eranos[/c] 100 (2002) 150–2 (though he takes a different
	view on the textual issue).
	[c dimgray][sup]197[/sup][/c]The Danaids are μέτοικοι (609, 994). At Athens a metic
	was required to nominate some citizen as his προστάτης (he
	could be prosecuted for failing to do so); the legal functions of the
	προστάτης are not clear, but he would no doubt normally in practice
	befriend the metic and help him in any business which a citizen
	could handle more effectively than a foreigner. The Danaids
	will be in the unique position of having the king and the entire
	citizen body as their προστάται.
	[c dimgray][sup]198[/sup][/c]Possibly a hint that Danaus should be sent with an escort
	(cf. 954–5).

	Arrange yourselves, dear maids, in the way
	in which Danaus allotted you to each of us
	as a dowry in the form of a servant.

	 There is, however, no other clear evidence in the text for the
	existence of these maidservants: they can hardly have only
	just come on stage (where could they have been before?),
	and had they been with their mistresses from the start, one
	would have expected some notice to be taken of them, especially
	by Pelasgus. Moreover, Pelasgus is still apparently
	being addressed in 973–4 and can hardly leave the scene
	before then, and it would be clumsy (and unparalleled) to
	have Danaus arrive from the same direction almost immediately
	afterwards. It is therefore likely that the maids, and
	the three lines addressed to them, were added to the play
	by a later producer, perhaps in place of a short choral
	song.

	Taplin, [c dimgray]The Stagecraft of Aeschylus[/c] (Oxford, 1977) 222–238. Perhaps
	the producer transferred the lines from [c dimgray]Danaids,[/c] where the

	[c dimgray][sup]206[/sup][/c] it, do they not? In the case of animals, winged or

	[c dimgray][sup]207[/sup][/c] advertises the availability of juicy fruits

	[c dimgray][sup]208[/sup][/c] and likewise with the charms of a maiden fair of

	Wecklein-Murray restoration, is intended only to give an approximate
	sense (and to suggest that (αν) θωσμένειν might conceal an
	infinitive meaning “resist” or the like—but I cannot find a suitable
	verb).West’s proposal, giving the sense “and at the same time softening
	up the less ripe, so as to madden them with desire”, unsatisfactorily
	distinguishes between ripe juicy (female) fruit ([c dimgray]towards
	which[/c] Cypris apparently directs the desire of the male animals)
	and unripe fruit ([c dimgray]in which[/c] she implants desire), leaving it unclear
	which of the two corresponds to the Danaids; in some respects it is
	also dubious linguistically (e.g. μωλύω, when it has a living being
	as object, usually refers to a change that [c dimgray]diminishes[/c] the creature’s
	health or vigour).

	altercation between the two. The dissenter(s) have been identified
	as half of the Danaids disputing with the other half
	(Hermann), as the maidservants of 977–9 (Kirchhoff), and as
	Danaus (Taplin); the currently favoured candidates are the escort
	of Argive soldiers (first suggested by H. Freericks; see more re- cently H. Friis Johansen, [c dimgray]Classica et Mediaevalia[/c] 27 \[1966\] 61–64,
	and R. Seaford, [c dimgray]Dioniso[/c] 55 \[1984\] 221–9). Yet another possibility

	in breach of normal tragic convention) takes a stand against her
	sisters; see D.A. Hester, [c dimgray]Antichthon[/c] 21 (1987) 9–18.

	act” (Friis Johansen and Whittle) as to the broader power that
	Aphrodite exercises over the whole living world (cf. 998–1005).
	[c dimgray][sup]218[/sup][/c]Cf. Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 203–6, where Aphrodite is said to
	have had allotted as her portion (μοῖραν) from the beginning “the
	whisperings and smiles and deceptions of maidens, and sweet delight
	and love-making (φιλότητα, cf. next note) and gentleness”.
	[c dimgray][sup]219[/sup][/c]Ἁρμονία (properly “joining together”) is used by Empedocles
	(frr. 27.3, 122 D-K) as a synonym for Φιλότης, the power
	that presided over that phase in the history of the universe when
	all the elements were intimately united.

	[b]Prometheus Bound[/b]
	[b]Prometheus Bound[/b]
	In late antiquity and the Middle Ages [c dimgray]Prometheus Bound[/c]
	was the most read of Aeschylean plays, and in subsequent
	centuries it has remained among the most popular; in particular,
	its portrayal of a god who endures potentially unending
	torment, for the sake of humanity, from the agents
	of a tyrannical Zeus, appealed very powerfully to thinkers,
	authors and artists of the revolutionary and romantic periods,
	notably Goethe, Byron, Shelley, Marx and Nietzsche.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	From the mid nineteenth century, however, doubts began
	to appear about whether the play was in fact his work.
	Some of these rested on the inadequate basis of supposed
	inconsistencies between the theology of this play and that
	of the rest of the Aeschylean corpus, but increasingly attention
	has been drawn to important features of style and
	technique in which [c dimgray]Prometheus Bound[/c] (as well as its evident
	sequel, [c dimgray]Prometheus Unbound[/c]) differ markedly from
	the undisputed plays of Aeschylus, and to possible echoes
	of other texts that were not composed until after his death.
	The issue remains in dispute, and the play’s authenticity
	continues to find powerful defenders, not least because it
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]For a review of the reception of this play in ancient, medieval
	and modern times, see A. J. Podlecki, [c dimgray]Aeschylus: Prometheus
	Bound[/c] (Oxford, 2005) 41–68.

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Prometheus Bound[/b]
	was never questioned in antiquity; but at present it would
	probably be true to say that a majority of scholars would regard
	it as being by a slightly later hand.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] West’s suggestion
	([c dimgray]Studies[/c] 67–72) that the hand is that of Aeschylus’ son
	Euphorion, passing his own work off as that of his father, is
	a very tempting one, not least because it gives full value to
	the play’s audacious grandeur of concept, reminiscent of
	that of the [c dimgray]Oresteia[/c] and quite unlike anything found in
	Sophocles or Euripides, which surely suggests Aeschylean
	inspiration even if the detailed technique may not suggest
	Aeschylean workmanship.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	We have no direct information as to when the play was
	produced. Whether by Aeschylus or not, it can hardly be
	earlier than [c dimgray]Suppliants,[/c] to which it contains a clear reference;

	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and it cannot be later than about 430, since in (probably)

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The play’s authenticity was first doubted by Robert Westphal
	in A. Rossbach and R. Westphal, [c dimgray]Metrik der griechischen
	Dramatiker und Lyriker[/c] (Leipzig, 1856) 3, and denied with powerful
	arguments by W. Schmid, [c dimgray]Untersuchungen zum Gefesselten
	Prometheus[/c] (Stuttgart, 1929). These, however, made little impact
	on English-speaking scholarship until the appearance of Mark
	Griffith’s [c dimgray]The Authenticity of Prometheus Bound[/c] (Cambridge,1977)
	which focused on linguistic, metrical and other technical
	arguments against authenticity. Important later studies taking the
	same view have included M. L. West, [c dimgray]JHS[/c] 99 (1979) 130–148
	and [c dimgray]Studies[/c] 51–72, and R. Bees, [c dimgray]Zur Datierung des Prometheus
	Desmotes[/c] (Stuttgart, 1993); the play’s authenticity has been defended
	by, among others, M. P. Pattoni, [c dimgray]L’autenticità del Prometeo
	Incatenato di Eschilo[/c] (Pisa, 1987) and Podlecki, [c dimgray]Aeschylus: Prometheus

	about Prometheus’ release, which he had narrated in 526–534,

	Cronus, and how he was himself at risk of being overthrown
	by a son of his if he did not take great care in choosing
	mothers for his children. In the [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] (507–510)
	he is a son of Iapetus, Cronus’ brother; in our play he is upgraded
	to be himself at least a half-brother of Cronus,

	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] who is in turn identified

	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] And Themis is
	able to give Prometheus knowledge—[c dimgray]fore[/c]knowledge, enabling
	him to live up to the meaning of his name—of crucial
	developments in the history of the divine world. She
	tells him that victory in the war between the generations of
	gods will go to craft, not to force (209–213), thus enabling

	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]There is also a side glance at another evidently well-known
	myth about Prometheus. At 231–6 we are told that Prometheus
	alone resisted, and frustrated, an attempt by Zeus to “obliterate
	the \[human\] race altogether and create another new one”; this
	may refer to his role in the Flood story (Hesiod fr. 2; Epicharmus
	frr. 113–120 K-A) or to another similar tale.
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]In [c dimgray]Prometheus Unbound[/c] (fr. 193.1) he calls the chorus of Titans
	[c dimgray]socia nostri sanguinis,[/c] and in Cratinus’ comedy [c dimgray]The Wealth-gods[/c]
	a chorus of Titans (fr. 171.11) say they have come in search of
	“our own old brother” ([c dimgray]ib.[/c] 25–26).
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]Cf. also 90, 1091. He is nowhere actually said to have Uranus
	as his father, though 165 may imply it.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]Cf. 18, 873–4. In [c dimgray]Eumenides[/c] (2) Themis is a [c dimgray]daughter[/c] of
	Gaea.
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]We are never actually told this in this play (though it may
	have been mentioned in [c dimgray]Prometheus Unbound,[/c] especially if Gaea Themis was a character there); but in Pindar ([c dimgray]Isthmian[/c] 8.29–51) it
	was Themis who revealed to the gods that Thetis was destined to
	bear a son mightier than his father, and in a parallel tale in Hesiod
	([c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 886–900) it was Gaea, with Uranus, who advised Zeus

	keep it safe, gives him ultimate power even over Zeus: the
	identity of the female who is destined to bear a son mightier
	than his father, and with whom, therefore, Zeus cannot
	mate without sealing his own doom. The audience probably
	know, as soon as they hear the prophecy, that Thetis
	is meant—and therefore how the confrontation between
	Prometheus and Zeus will in due course end; Prometheus
	knows too, of course, but Zeus does not. In the latter part
	of the play Prometheus proclaims the coming fall of Zeus
	more and more loudly, but nothing will make him reveal
	who the fatal female is; and his punishment and pain, already
	greater than anything that a mortal can even imagine,
	is increased even further. He is told that (as in
	Hesiod)
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] Zeus’ eagle will come to gnaw at his liver, but
	only after he has been thrust beneath the earth to remain
	in darkness for a long period.

	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c]This Athenian method of capital punishment involved
	clamping the criminal by the neck, wrists and ankles to a large
	board and standing the board up, perhaps against a wall, in such a
	way that the condemned man’s feet did not reach the ground; he
	would be left degradingly and agonizingly exposed, with no one
	permitted to come near him, probably until sunset when, if still
	alive, he would be strangled by tightening the neck clamp. Euripides’
	old in-law is subjected to this treatment (for sacrilege) in
	Aristophanes’ [c dimgray]Thesmophoriazusae[/c] (930–1208) until Euripides
	rescues and releases him. See L. Gernet, [c dimgray]REG[/c] 37 (1924) 261–293,
	and R. J. Bonner and G. Smith, [c dimgray]The Administration of Justice from
	Homer to Aristotle[/c] (Chicago, 1930–8) ii 279–287. Prometheus,
	being immortal, will remain thus not for one day, but day and
	night for an indefinite period (19–34)—though for the actor’s
	benefit a discreet footrest will doubtless have been provided.

	produced together with [c dimgray]Prometheus Unbound;[/c] numerous
	fragments of the latter play are preserved, and they are
	presented and discussed in the Fragments section of this
	edition. Prometheus also gives a title to what, [c dimgray]prima facie[/c],
	are two other Aeschylean plays, [c dimgray]Prometheus the Fire-
	Bearer[/c] (Πυρφόρος) and [c dimgray]Prometheus the Fire-Kindler[/c]
	(Πυρκαεύς). From the latter a fragment (205) is cited
	whose metre guarantees that it comes from a satyr-drama,
	not a tragedy, and this must have been the Prometheus satyr-drama that was produced together with [c dimgray]Persians[/c] and its
	companion plays in 472. [c dimgray]Prometheus the Fire-Bearer[/c] has
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]He does not mention dismounting or remounting, though
	his line “Your words are plainly meant to send me back home”
	(387)—his first single-line speech in the scene—provide a possible
	occasion for the latter.

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Prometheus Bound[/b]
	usually been taken to be the title of a tragedy produced together
	with [c dimgray]Bound[/c] and [c dimgray]Unbound,[/c] either as the first play of
	a trilogy (dealing with Prometheus’ theft of fire) or as the
	last (dealing, perhaps, with the establishment of his Athenian
	cult). There are, however, serious objections to either
	view, and it is more likely that [c dimgray]Prometheus the Fire-Bearer[/c]
	is merely an alternative (and arguably a more appropriate)
	title for the satyr-drama of 472.
	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c] In that case we have no
	way of knowing what the third (or for that matter the
	fourth) play was that Aeschylus, or Euphorion, or whoever
	it may have been, produced together with the two in which
	Prometheus was first taken down to Hades and then
	brought back up to fresh torment and then to release and
	glory.

	We have reached the land at the furthest bounds of earth,
	the Scythian marches, a wilderness where no mortals live.
	Hephaestus, you must attend to the instructions the Father
	has laid upon you, to bind this criminal to the high
	rocky cliffs in the unbreakable fetters of adamantine
	bonds; for it was your glory, the gleam of fire that makes all
	skills attainable, that he stole and gave to mortals. For such
	an offence he must assuredly pay his penalty to the gods, to
	teach him that he must accept the autocracy of Zeus and
	abandon his human-loving ways.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]hephaestus[/b][/c]
	So far as you two are concerned, Power and Violence,
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] the
	orders of Zeus have been completely fulfilled, and there is
	no task still lying before you. But for my part, I can hardly
	bring myself to take a kindred god and forcibly bind him at
	this stormy ravine; still, I have no alternative but to endure
	doing it, for it is dangerous to slight the Father’s word. \[[c dimgray]To
	Prometheus[/c]\] God of lofty cunning, son of Themis
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] of
	wise counsel, I, under as much constraint as you, am going
	to nail you, with metal bonds hard to undo, to this rock, remote
	from men. Here you will hear no mortal voice, see no

	are children of Styx who live permanently with Zeus, follow wherever
	he leads, and embody his absolute power over the universe.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]This is an innovation; in Hesiod’s [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] Prometheus is
	son of Cronus’ brother Iapetus and the Oceanid Clymene (507–511), while Themis has no children until she bears Dike, the
	Fates, the Seasons and others to Zeus (901–6).

	mortal form; you will lose the bloom of your skin, grilled by
	the brilliant flames of the sun; welcome to you will be
	Night of the gaudy apparel when she hides the daylight,
	but welcome too the return of the sun to disperse the early
	morning frost;
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and you will be continually worn down by
	the burden of one or another kind of suffering, for he who
	can relieve it is not yet born.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] This is what you have gained
	from your human-loving ways. Though a god, you did not
	tremble before the anger of the gods, and you gave honours
	to mortals beyond what is right; in punishment for
	which you will keep watch on this rock, upright, without
	sleep, without bending your knee,
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] and will utter many

	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]i.e. the coming of night will temporarily end one kind of suffering
	(from the sun) only to bring another (cold) from which, in
	turn, you will long for relief; and vice versa.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]Hephaestus should no doubt be taken to intend this as an understatement
	for “will never be born”; the audience will probably
	detect an ironic allusion to Heracles (cf. Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 526–531),
	but they will later discover (757–768) that Prometheus
	knows of another sense in which a being not yet born could end his
	suffering.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]“Bending the knee” idiomatically means “resting” (396; [c dimgray]Iliad[/c]
	7.118, 19.71); but Prometheus in his bonds will be [c dimgray]literally[/c] unable
	to bend his.
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]Not entirely logical, since Hephaestus is also
	close kin (nephew) to Zeus.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]This may possibly foreshadow
	the cultic association in classical Athens between Prometheus and
	Hephaestus (they shared an altar in the Academy district, cf.
	Apollodorus [c dimgray]FGrH[/c] 244 F 147), but this can hardly be imagined as
	existing at the time of the play’s action; the poet may be thinking
	rather of Prometheus’ alliance with the Olympians in their war
	against Cronus and the Titans (cf. 214–221).

	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]Prometheus’ “harness” consists of metal bands clamping his
	arms (55–63), upper body (71) and legs (74–81) to the rock, plus
	the wedge ostensibly driven through his chest (64–69).
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]Greek σοφιστής “one who professes wisdom or expertise”.
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]For the transposition here adopted see M. Dyson, [c dimgray]JHS[/c] 114
	(1994) 154–6: it makes the structure of the middle phase of the
	binding (chest) parallel to that of the first phase (arms) and the last
	phase (legs)—as Dyson schematically expresses it, “‘Do it’—‘Done’—‘Make it firmer’—‘Done’”. It also (a point not made by
	Dyson) eases the problem of staging the insertion of the wedge,
	which can be so made that when it is (lightly) hammered it fastens
	itself into the chest-band and stays in position.

	It is painful for me even to speak of these things, but it is
	also painful to keep silent: it is wretched either way. As
	soon as the gods began to quarrel and mutual strife was
	stirred up among them, some wishing to depose Cronus
	from his throne—so that Zeus could reign, forsooth!—while those on the other side were determined that Zeus
	should never rule over the gods, at that time I gave the best
	advice to the Titans, the children of Uranus and Gaea,
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c]
	but could not persuade them. They despised ingenious
	stratagems, and in the pride of their strength they thought
	they could retain control with ease by brute force. But my
	mother Themis, also called Gaea—one person under multiple
	names
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c]—had more than once prophesied to me how
	the future would come to pass, saying that it was destined
	that the victors should be those who excelled not in might
	nor in power but in guile.
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] I spoke to them explaining this,
	but they simply did not see fit even to look at the idea. Well,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c]i.e. Heaven and Earth. The goddess Earth is actually here
	called Χθών (as in [c dimgray]Eum.[/c] 6), but Γαῖα in 210.
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c]This identification is almost certainly an [c dimgray]ad hoc[/c] invention; it
	is otherwise attested only by the existence in Roman Athens of a priestess of Γῆ Θέμις ([c dimgray]IG[/c] ii<sub>2</sub> 5130). The poet wanted Prometheus
	to be one of the Titans (cf. note on 165), but also wanted his
	mother to be Themis, a prophetic goddess (cf. [c dimgray]Eum.[/c] 2–4; Euripides,
	[c dimgray]Iphigenia in Tauris[/c] 1259–69) who according to Pindar ([c dimgray]Isthmian[/c]
	8.30–45) alone had knowledge that the son of Thetis was
	destined to be mightier than his father. Traditionally Themis was
	[c dimgray]daughter[/c] of Gaea (and Uranus) (Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 135).
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c]In Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 626–8, Gaea is said to have advised
	Zeus and the Olympians to release from their underground
	imprisonment Briareus, Cottus and Gyges (the “Hundredhanders”),
	who played a decisive role (though they used force, not
	guile!) in the final defeat of the Titans ([c dimgray]ibid.[/c] 669–675, 713–720).

	it then seemed to me the best of the available options to
	stand beside Zeus in an alliance that both parties welcomed,
	taking my mother with me; and by my counsels the
	black depths of Tartarus’ recesses now cover Cronus of ancient
	birth together with those who fought beside him.
	Such are the benefits that the autocrat of the gods has received
	from me, and this is the evil reward with which he
	has recompensed me! It seems that this malady is built into
	autocracy, that of not trusting one’s friends. But as to the
	question you ask, what is the cause of his thus degrading
	me, I will now explain it. As soon as he took his seat on his
	father’s throne, he immediately assigned to the various
	gods their various privileges,
	[c dimgray][sup]26[/sup][/c] and organized his government;
	but of those wretched creatures, mortals, he took no
	account at all—on the contrary, he wanted to obliterate the
	race altogether and create another new one. And no one
	resisted that plan except me. I had the courage to do it, and
	rescued mortals from the fate of being shattered and going
	to Hades.
	[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c] And that, you see, is why I am being racked by
	these torments, agonizing to suffer and piteous to see. I
	took special pity on mortals, but was not held to merit it
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]26[/sup][/c]Cf. Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 885.
	[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c]Prometheus was the helper god in the Greek version of the
	Flood story; his role is first attested in Epicharmus’ comedy [c dimgray]Prometheus
	or Pyrrha,[/c] but must be older than that (cf. Hesiod fr. 2).
	Here, however, “shattered” may indicate that we are to assume
	Zeus to have been planning a cataclysm of some other kind.

	such sharp and savage words, Zeus, though he sits far
	above, may well hear you, with the result that the crowd of
	miseries you have at present will seem like child’s play.
	Cast off the temper you have, poor suffering one, and look
	for a way to escape these troubles. What I am going to say
	may seem to you rather hackneyed, but these, Prometheus,
	[c dimgray]are[/c] the wages of an over-arrogant tongue. Are you
	still not humbled, not yielding to your troubles? Do you
	want to get more of them, on top of what you have? Well, if
	you accept me as your adviser, you won’t kick out against
	the goad, being aware that we have a harsh monarch holding
	irresponsible
	[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c] power. Now I will go and try to see if I
	can get you released from these sufferings. You keep quiet
	and don’t speak too impetuously; or do you not know very
	well, exceptionally intelligent as you are, that foolish words
	lead to punishment being inflicted?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]prometheus[/b][/c]
	I congratulate you on being safe from accusation, not having
	dared to share in my efforts. Leave the thing alone now,
	too; don’t get involved in it. In any case you won’t persuade
	him, because he’s not easy to persuade. And look out for
	yourself, in case your journey brings you some grief.

	admonishing yourself: I judge that by facts, not by words.
	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c]
	But I am determined to go; don’t drag me back. I tell you, I
	tell you that Zeus will grant me this boon, so as to release
	you from these sufferings.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]prometheus[/b][/c]
	I thank you for that, and I shall never cease to be grateful;
	you are certainly not short of zeal. But don’t make the effort.
	Any effort you make for me, if you do make one, will
	be wasted and will do no good. Keep quiet, and keep yourself
	out of harm’s way. Even if [c dimgray]my[/c] fortunes are poor, I
	wouldn’t for that reason want suffering to strike as many
	others as possible! Certainly not, seeing how distressed I
	am by the fate of my brother Atlas,
	[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c] who stands in the
	lands of the west, supporting on his shoulders the pillars of
	heaven and earth,
	[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c] a grievous burden on his arms. And
	I have seen and pitied the earth-born inhabitant of the
	Cilician cave,
	[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c] a fierce monster with a hundred heads, now
	subdued by force—furious Typhon, who once rose up
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c]i.e. if you had been “good at admonishing yourself” and had
	behaved prudently, you would not be where you are now.
	[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c]In Hesiod ([c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 507–9) Atlas, like Prometheus, is son
	of Iapetus and Clymene; here, presumably, he has been tacitly
	transferred to Prometheus’ new parents, Uranus and Gaea.
	[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c]An illogical blend of the descriptions of Atlas’ task in the
	[c dimgray]Theogony[/c] (517–9) and the [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] (1.52–54).
	[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c]The whole passage on Typhon (Typhos, Typhoeus) is closely
	parallel to, and probably based on, Pindar, [c dimgray]Pythian[/c] 1.15–28, who
	also mentions a “Cilician cave” as his original home; Homer ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c]
	2.783) had placed Typhoeus εἰν Ἀρίμοις, and there was apparently
	a mountain range called Arima in Cilicia (Callisthenes
	[c dimgray]FGrH[/c] 124 F 33).

	against the gods,
	[c dimgray][sup]39[/sup][/c] hissing terror from his formidable jaws
	while a fierce radiance flashed from his eyes, with the intention
	of overthrowing the autocracy of Zeus by force.
	But there came against him the unsleeping weapon of
	Zeus, the downrushing thunderbolt breathing out flame,
	which struck him out of his haughty boasts—for he was hit
	right in the centre of his body,
	[c dimgray][sup]40[/sup][/c] and his strength was thundered
	out of him and reduced to ashes. And now he lies,
	a sprawled, inert body, near the narrows of the sea,
	[c dimgray][sup]41[/sup][/c]
	crushed under the roots of Mount Etna; on its topmost
	peaks Hephaestus sits forging red-hot iron,
	[c dimgray][sup]42[/sup][/c] and from
	thence one day will burst forth rivers of fire, devouring
	with their savage jaws the smooth fields of Sicily with their

	beginning, though they had eyes and ears they could make
	nothing of what they saw and heard;
	[c dimgray][sup]54[/sup][/c] like dream-figures
	they lived a life of utter random confusion all their days.
	They knew nothing of brick-built, sun-warmed houses, nor
	of wooden construction; they dwelt underground, like tiny
	ants, in the sunless recesses of caves. Nor had they any reliable
	indicator of winter, or of flowery spring, or of fruitful
	summer; they did everything without planning, until I
	showed them the hard-to-discern risings and settings of
	stars.
	[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c] I also invented for them the art of number, supreme
	among all techniques, and that of combining letters
	into written words, the tool that enables all things to be
	remembered and is mother of the Muses.
	[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c] And I was the
	first to bring beasts
	[c dimgray][sup]57[/sup][/c] under the yoke as slaves to the yoke-strap
	and the pack-saddle, so that they might relieve humans
	of their greatest labours; and I brought horses to love

	[c dimgray][sup]54[/sup][/c]lit. “seeing, they saw to no effect; hearing, they did not hear”.
	[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c]Any given star rises (and sets) four minutes earlier each day,
	and Greeks used as markers of the seasons the days when prominent
	stars or star-groups (e.g. Sirius, Arcturus, the Pleiades) could
	first be seen rising (or, six months later, setting) before daybreak.
	These risings and settings are “hard to discern” because knowledge
	of them presupposes the ability to pick out the marker stars
	from the thousands of others in the sky.
	[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c]i.e. facilitates the composition of poetry. There is a wordplay
	on the traditional genealogy of the Muses, who were daughters
	of Zeus and Mnemosyne (Memory) (Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 915–7).

	there was no means of aiding him, neither by food nor ointment

	drugs, with which they can now defend themselves against

	that Prometheus has suffered is the binding and torment, and the
	simile of the doctor confirms this: both Prometheus and the doctor
	are prevented by [c dimgray]their own mental shortcomings[/c] from finding
	a way to escape a predicament in which [c dimgray]external forces[/c] (respectively,
	the will of Zeus and disease) have placed them. Heimsoeth’s
	emendation makes the chorus’s words coherent: they (profess to)
	think that Prometheus’ mood of rigid defiance—which, as they
	see things, forecloses any possibility of release—is due to his mind
	having been warped by his sufferings.

	and encounters on journeys;
	[c dimgray][sup]59[/sup][/c] I defined precisely the
	flight of crook-taloned birds, which of them were favourable
	and which sinister by nature, the habits of each species
	and their mutual hatreds, affections and companionships;

	[c dimgray][sup]60[/sup][/c] and the smoothness of internal organs,
	[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c] and what
	colour bile should have if it is to be pleasing to the gods,
	and the mottled appearance and proper shape of the liver-lobe;
	I wrapped the thigh-bones and the long chine in fat
	and burnt them,
	[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c] guiding mortals towards a skill of making
	difficult inferences, and opening their eyes to the signs
	the flames gave, which till then had been dark to them.
	So much for that; but as for the things hidden beneath
	the earth that benefit humanity—copper, iron, silver and
	gold—who can claim to have discovered them before I
	did? No one, I know for sure, unless he wanted to spout
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]59[/sup][/c]Words that a person happened to (over)hear, or individuals
	or animals that he happened to meet, might in certain circumstances
	be regarded as omens of predictive significance; see for
	example Aristophanes, [c dimgray]Lysistrata[/c] 391–7 (women’s laments for the
	death of Adonis punctuating a speech advocating the despatch of
	the Sicilian Expedition) and Theophrastus, [c dimgray]Characters[/c] 16.3 (a
	polecat crossing one’s path as a sign of bad luck).
	[c dimgray][sup]60[/sup][/c]Knowledge of these was important for augury because it enabled the seer to relate the observed behaviour of a bird to (what was believed to be) its normal behaviour. Thus, when Xenophon
	was setting out from Ephesus to join Cyrus’ expedition, a sedentary
	eagle screamed on his right side (Xenophon, [c dimgray]Anabasis[/c]
	6.1.23); the seer whom he consulted told him that while this omen
	foretold greatness and glory, it also betokened suffering (because
	“other birds mostly attack the eagle when it is sedentary”) and did
	not portend material gain (because “the eagle normally gets its
	food when it is on the wing”).
	[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c]This, and what follows as far as 499, refers to the drawing of
	omens from the appearance of the internal parts of sacrificed animals,
	and from the manner in which they burned on the altar.
	[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c]Prometheus is said by Hesiod ([c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 535–557) to have
	been the inventor of this Greek sacrificial practice, but there he
	does it in an attempt (unsuccessful, and disastrous for mankind) to
	deceive Zeus, whereas here his object is to enable mortals to use
	the flames for divination.

	Come, my friend, what favour has this favour done

	Tell me, where do you find any support?

	the blind race of men is fettered? Never
	will the schemes of mortals transgress the ordering of

	I learned this from seeing

	and this song that has flown to my lips is very different
	from the wedding-song I sang in honour of bath
	[c dimgray][sup]65[/sup][/c] and

	(e.g. those of [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 18.158–303) the bride-gifts (ἕδνα) offered by suitors in the heroic age were given not to the woman but to her

	[c dimgray][sup]67[/sup][/c]The wife of Prometheus (and mother of Deucalion, the

	wretched life. In my maiden chamber I was persistently
	visited by nocturnal visions which coaxed me in smooth
	words: “Most greatly blessed maiden, why do you remain a
	virgin so long, when you could have the greatest of unions?
	Zeus has been struck
	[c dimgray][sup]77[/sup][/c] by a dart of desire coming from
	you,
	[c dimgray][sup]78[/sup][/c] and wishes to partake of Cypris with you. Do not,
	my child, spurn the bed of Zeus, but go out to the deep
	meadow of Lerna, among the flocks and cow-byres of your
	father, so that Zeus’s eye may be assuaged of its desire.”
	Every night I was miserably plagued by dreams like that,
	until I brought myself to tell my father about the dreams
	that kept coming to me nightly. He sent envoys repeatedly
	to Delphi and Dodona to consult the oracles, so that he
	could learn what he should do or say so as to act in a
	manner pleasing to the gods: they returned reporting ambiguous
	responses, their expression obscure and hard to
	interpret. Finally a clear word came to Inachus, plainly
	telling and enjoining him to thrust me out of my house and
	my native place, to wander unprotected
	[c dimgray][sup]79[/sup][/c] on the furthest
	confines of the land; and that if he refused, a fiery thunderbolt
	would come from Zeus that would annihilate his
	entire family. Persuaded by these oracles of Loxias, he

	than the western end of the Black Sea; Salmydessus was in
	Thrace, north-west of Byzantium and the (Thracian) Bosporus,
	and the danger to ships in that area arose not from a rocky promontory
	but from extensive shoals (Xenophon, [c dimgray]Anabasis[/c] 7.5.12).

	Since you are so eager, I will not refuse to tell you everything

	on which you will be driven: inscribe them on the
	memory-tablets of your mind. When you have crossed
	the stream that parts the two continents, go on towards
	the fiery rising of the sun, crossing a waveless sea,

	where the Phorcides
	[c dimgray][sup]94[/sup][/c] dwell, three ancient maidens of

	[c dimgray][sup]95[/sup][/c] owning an eye in common and having

	the moon by night, ever looks upon;
	[c dimgray][sup]96[/sup][/c] and near them their
	three winged sisters, the snake-tressed Gorgons, haters of

	[c dimgray][sup]94[/sup][/c]Also called the Graeae. Like the Gorgons, they belong to
	the story of Io’s descendant Perseus, who by seizing their shared
	eye and tooth forced them to tell him how to find the nymphs who
	possessed the equipment he needed to cut off Medusa’s head.

	from birth (Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 271).
	[c dimgray][sup]96[/sup][/c]The language echoes [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 11.16, describing the Cimmerians,

	“shrouded in mist and cloud”.

	shall tell to you and to her alike, going back to the same
	track my previous words were treading. There is a city
	called Canobus,
	[c dimgray][sup]106[/sup][/c] on the edge of land and sea, right at the
	mouth of the Nile where it lays down its silt. There Zeus
	will restore you to your right mind <and cause you to conceive>
	[c dimgray][sup]107[/sup][/c] simply by touching you and laying his hand on
	you, nothing to be afraid of. And you will bear a black child,
	Epaphus, named after the manner in which Zeus engendered
	him;
	[c dimgray][sup]108[/sup][/c] he will reap the fruits of all the land that is
	watered by the broad-flowing Nile. The fifth generation
	from him, a female brood of fifty children,
	[c dimgray][sup]109[/sup][/c] will come
	back to Argos, not by choice but in flight from a kindred
	marriage to their cousins; the cousins, their minds excited
	by lust, hawks following close behind the doves,
	[c dimgray][sup]110[/sup][/c] will
	come to hunt marriages that they should not have been
	hunting, but god will deny them possession of their bodies.
	The Pelasgian land will be drenched with blood by deadly
	female violence when the men are audaciously slain in the
	wakeful night; for each woman will deprive her husband of
	his life, dipping a two-edged sword in his blood. So may

	as though Zeus is likely, if not forewarned, to engender the fatal
	offspring in the very near future; in fact the crisis will not occur for

	[c dimgray][sup]125[/sup][/c]for him”. The “one who would become immortal” has often been
	taken to be Prometheus himself, but that is absurd, since Prometheus
	was immortal already; rather, Prometheus, with typical ingenuity,
	proposed that Cheiron’s immortality should be conferred
	on [c dimgray]Heracles,[/c] thus enabling Cheiron to die (“willing\[ly\] . . . go\[ing\]
	down to rayless Hades”), Heracles to become a god, and Prometheus
	to fulfil the condition laid down for his release. All this is
	likely to have occurred, as part of a general settlement, after

	the secret concerning Thetis. See D. S. Robertson, [c dimgray]JHS[/c] 71 (1951)

	bloodthirsty eagle, will greedily butcher your body into
	great ragged shreds, coming uninvited for a banquet that
	lasts all day, and will feast on your liver, which will turn
	black with gnawing.
	[c dimgray][sup]124[/sup][/c] Of such torment expect no end until
	some god appears to be your successor in suffering and is
	willing to go down to rayless Hades and the dark depths of
	Tartarus.
	[c dimgray][sup]125[/sup][/c] Make your decision in the light of that, because
	this threat is no invention, it has all too certainly
	been uttered. For the mouth of Zeus does not know how to
	lie; he fulfils every word he speaks.
	[c dimgray][sup]126[/sup][/c] So consider and reflect:

	[c dimgray][sup]124[/sup][/c]“Like any half-eaten piece of offal, dark from exposure to
	the air and from dried blood” (Griffith).
	[c dimgray][sup]125[/sup][/c]This condition (which Zeus/Hermes evidently suppose to
	be impossible of fulfilment) will surely have been fulfilled, in some
	unexpected way, in [c dimgray]Prometheus Unbound.[/c] It is almost certainly
	to be linked with the story about the centaur Cheiron told in
	\[Apollodorus\], [c dimgray]Library[/c] 2. 5. 4, 2. 5. 11. Cheiron, who was immortal,
	having been painfully and incurably wounded by Heracles’ arrow,
	longed to die but was unable to do so, thus becoming Prometheus’
	“successor in suffering” (in kind if not in degree) until “Prometheus
	gave to Zeus one who would become immortal in exchange
	[c dimgray][sup]126[/sup][/c]The text does not make the structure of Hermes’ argument
	completely clear: his point is that (though he, Hermes, is a notorious
	liar and deceiver) the threats he has announced are not an “invention”
	by him but have “all too certainly been uttered” by Zeus,
	who never lies, and therefore they cannot be ignored.

	nights on the Atreidae’s roof, resting on my elbows like a
	dog,
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and come to know thoroughly the throng of stars of

	them as some set and others rise. And now I’m

	bringing from Troy the word and news of its capture; for
	such is the ruling of a woman’s hopeful heart, which plans
	like a man. But while I keep this night-walker’s bed, wet
	with dew, this bed of mine not watched over by dreams
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]—for
	it is Fear instead of Sleep that stands beside me, preventing
	me from closing my eyes firmly in sleep—but
	when I decide to sing or hum, applying
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] this remedy to
	charm away sleep, then I weep, grieving over the fortunes
	of this house, which is not now admirably managed as it
	used to be. But now may there be a happy release from

	brings good news.

	[c darkmagenta][b]chorus[/b][/c]

	This is the tenth year since against Priam
	his great prosecutor,
	King Menelaus, together with Agamemnon,
	the Atreidae, a pair firmly yoked
	in the honour of their twin thrones and twin scepters
	given by Zeus,
	launched the thousand-ship expedition of the Argives
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]
	from this land
	as military backers for their suit,
	uttering from their hearts a great cry for war,
	like birds of prey
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] who, crazed
	by grief
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] for their children, wheel around
	high above their eyries,
	rowing with wings for oars,
	having seen the toil of watching
	over their nestlings’ beds go for nothing;
	and some Apollo on high, or Pan,
	or Zeus, hearing the loud shrill wailing cries
	of the birds, exacts belated revenge
	on behalf of these denizens of his realm
	by sending a Fury against the transgressors.
	So the sons of Atreus were sent
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]Throughout this play Aeschylus exploits the ambiguity of
	Ἀργεῖοι, which can mean either “men of Argos” or (as regularly in
	Homer) “Greeks”.
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]αἰγυπιός is usually rendered “vulture”, but in Homer (esp.
	[c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 17.460) they are raptors (like eagles), not scavengers; probably
	the lammergeyer or bearded vulture ([c dimgray]Gypaetus barbatus[/c]) is
	meant, since this bird was (wrongly) believed by the ancients to be
	a raptor. See J. R. T. Pollard, [c dimgray]Birds in Greek Life and Myth[/c] (London,
	1977) 79–80.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]lit. “in out-of-their-path grief”, i.e. in grief that makes them
	wildly alter their normal flight patterns.

	against Alexander
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] by the mightier power, Zeus
	god of hospitality,
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] who thus, for the sake of a woman of
	many men,
	was to impose many limb-wearying struggles,
	with the knee pressed down into the dust
	and the spearshaft shattered
	in the pre-nuptial rites,
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] upon the Danaans
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c]
	and the Trojans alike. It is now
	where it is, and it is being fulfilled according to destiny:
	neither by the kindling of flames nor by the pouring on
	of fireless offerings
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c]
	will he
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c] charm away that stubborn anger.
	But we, who because of our ancient flesh could not then
	contribute
	to the force in support, and were left behind,
	remain here, guiding
	our childlike strength upon staffs.
	For the immature marrow
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]
	that rules in a child’s breast
	is like that of an old man, and there is no Ares
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] in that
	realm;
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]The more common Greek name for the person better
	known to Romans and moderns as Paris (and so called at 399 and
	532 below).
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c]Because Paris had abused the hospitality of Menelaus by
	seducing and eloping with his host’s wife.
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c]For this ironic use of προτέλεια, properly sacrifices offered
	before a wedding, cf. 227 below. The “wedding” to which these sacrifices/battles are preliminary is the reunion of Helen and
	Menelaus (so rightly Bollack).
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c]Another regular Homeric
	term for the Greek army attacking Troy.
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c]The first phrase refers to the sacrifice of animals (certain
	parts of which were burned on the altar), the second to libations.
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c]i.e. Paris, if the text is sound; but a simple emendation will
	give the sense “will you” (i.e. “will one”).
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]The μυελός (a
	term that covered brain-matter as well as bone-marrow) was conceived
	as “the vital fluid which is the stuff of life” (H. Lloyd-Jones
	in R. D. Dawe et al. ed. [c dimgray]Dionysiaca[/c] \[Cambridge, 1978\] 51) and is
	sometimes actually called αἰών “life” (e.g. Pindar fr. 111).
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]i.e. none of the spirit and strength needed for warfare.

	“So very kindly disposed is the Fair One
	to the unfledged seed of fiery lions,
	and so delightsome to the suckling whelps
	of all beasts that roam the wild:
	she demands to bring about a counterpart to this.
	<I interpret> the portent as auspicious but not
	unblemished.
	So I call on the healer Paeon:
	[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c]
	let her not cause any persistent adverse winds that hold
	back the Danaan ships
	from sailing, bent on another sacrificial slaughter, one
	without music or feasting,
	a fashioner of strife, bred in the race, not fearing
	any man; for there awaits, to arise hereafter, a fearsome,
	guileful keeper of the house, a Wrath that remembers
	and will avenge a child.”
	[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c]
	Such were the words that Calchas cried forth, together
	with great blessings,
	words fateful for the royal house, prompted by the birds
	seen by the way;
	and in unison with them
	cry sorrow, sorrow, but may good prevail!
	Zeus—whoever he may be, if it pleases him
	to be so called,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c]Calchas, who as a prophet is a servant of Apollo, begs his
	patron god to intercede with his sister Artemis.
	[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c]In Calchas’ oracular words—unintelligible to his original
	hearers, and mostly also to the Elders now, but easily interpretable
	by the audience—the coming sacrifice of Iphigeneia is half-identified
	with the wrath it will generate, which in turn is half-identified
	with the person (a “guileful keeper of the house . . . that
	. . . will avenge a child”) in whom that wrath will reside.

	then I address him by that name:
	I have nothing to compare,
	though I weigh everything in the balance
	except Zeus, if one is truly to cast away
	the vain burden of anxiety.
	The one who was formerly great,
	[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c]
	swelling with proud confidence he could fight any foe,
	will now not even be spoken of as existing in the past;
	and he who was born later
	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c]
	has met his conqueror,
	[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c] and is gone.
	One who gladly utters loud songs of victory to Zeus
	will score a perfect hit on the target of wisdom—
	Zeus who set mortals on the road
	to understanding, who made
	“learning by suffering” into an effective law.
	[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c]
	There drips before the heart,
	[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c] instead of sleep,

	[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c]lit. “thrice-thrower”, i.e. conqueror in a wrestling match.
	[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c]I take this to mean that Zeus, in contrast with his predecessor
	Cronus (whose reign was traditionally a toil-free golden age;
	cf. Hesiod, [c dimgray]Works and Days[/c] 109–119), first caused humans to suffer
	and thus made it possible for them to learn from (their own or
	others’) bitter experience. See my article in H. D. Jocelyn ed. [c dimgray]Tria
	Lustra: Essays and Notes Presented to John Pinsent[/c] (Liverpool,
	1993) 109–114.
	[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c]“Drips” evokes the irritating noise of dripping water (e.g.
	from eaves after rain, or from a leaky roof) which may keep one
	awake at night (cf. 559–561, and 891–3 on another irritating nocturnal
	noise); the heart is mentioned as being the seat of thought
	and emotion.

	also cried forth another
	remedy for the hateful storms,
	one more grievous for the leaders, declaring
	Artemis as their cause,
	[c dimgray][sup]45[/sup][/c] so that the Atreidae
	struck the ground with their staffs
	and could not hold back their tears—
	and the senior king spoke, and said this:
	“It is a grievous doom not to comply,
	and a grievous one if I am to slay my child, the delight of
	my house,
	polluting a father’s hands
	with streams of a slaughtered maiden’s blood close by
	the altar. Which of these options is free from evil?
	How can I become a deserter of the fleet,
	[c dimgray][sup]46[/sup][/c]
	losing my alliance?
	[c dimgray][sup]47[/sup][/c]
	That they should long with intense passion
	for a sacrifice to end the winds
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]45[/sup][/c]This seems to imply that at first Calchas had refrained from
	stating that Artemis was responsible for the adverse winds and
	that the fleet could not sail for Troy unless Iphigeneia was sacrificed;
	the sacrifice will then be called “another remedy” in contrast
	to remedies that had already been tried without success
	(such as, say, animal sacrifices to the wind-god Boreas).
	[c dimgray][sup]46[/sup][/c]Agamemnon puts the alternative in the worst possible light.
	In fact it is, and was, neither cowardly nor criminal for a com- mander to abandon or discontinue a military enterprise when its
	aims clearly cannot be fulfilled except at ruinous material or moral
	cost; see Sommerstein [c dimgray]AT[/c] 363–5.
	[c dimgray][sup]47[/sup][/c]The phrase ξυμμαχίας ἁμαρτών could probably also mean
	“failing in my obligations to my allies”; but nothing in this play,
	or even in the [c dimgray]Iliad[/c], suggests that Agamemnon is under any relevant
	obligation to any of his allies except perhaps Menelaus—and Menelaus, we know (cf. 202–4 above), was as distressed by
	Calchas’ declaration as Agamemnon was. The rendering adopted
	here, which is easier grammatically, will refer to the possible loss
	of Agamemnon’s hegemonic position after the blow to his prestige
	that would result from the abandonment of a great undertaking to
	which he had set his hand.

	[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c]A sacrificial victim had to be seen to go to death willingly;
	an act or sound indicating reluctance or resistance would invalidate
	the sacrifice—and here, where the victim was human,

	Comedy[/c] \[New York, 1981\] 175); as she is held aloft, its folds fall

	reference to the actual slaying of Iphigeneia, and the event
	vindicating Calchas’ prophecy will be the changing of the wind;
	with the rendering adopted here, the chorus elide the slaying altogether
	as their thoughts move forward to the war itself, which
	Calchas had predicted (126–130) would be long but victorious.

	[c darkmagenta][b]clytaemestra[/b][/c]
	Hephaestus, sending a bright blaze on its way from Mount
	Ida; and then from that courier-fire
	[c dimgray][sup]60[/sup][/c] beacon sent on beacon
	all the way here. Ida sent it to Hermes’ crag
	[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c] on
	Lemnos, and from the island the great flambeau was received,
	thirdly, by the steep height of Zeus at Athos. Then
	the mighty travelling torch <shot up> aloft to arch over the
	sea, to the delight <of the god>, bringing its message-flame
	close to the sky, <and landed on Peparethos, where again
	much> pinewood <was burned,>
	[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c] which, like another sun,
	conveyed the message in light of golden brilliance to the
	watch-heights of Macistus.
	[c dimgray][sup]63[/sup][/c] Nor did Macistus neglect its
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]60[/sup][/c]Aeschylus uses the Persian word ἄγγαρος, referring to the
	Persian state messenger service with its relays of mounted couriers
	(see Herodotus 8. 98).
	[c dimgray][sup]61[/sup][/c]Also mentioned by Sophocles, [c dimgray]Philoctetes[/c] 1459; not certainly
	identifiable.
	[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c]Neither grammar nor sense can be made of the sentence
	286–9 as the mss. present it, and it is almost certain that something
	has been lost, particularly since the distance from Athos to
	Euboea (see next note) would be very long for a single beacon-stage.
	I translate the gist (rather than the wording) of West’s illustrative
	supplement ([c dimgray]Studies[/c] 181–3): Peparethos (now Skopelos),
	which he proposes as the lost intermediate beacon-site, is the largest
	and highest island in its group, and lies directly between Athos
	and Euboea.
	[c dimgray][sup]63[/sup][/c]The reference to the Euripus in 292 shows that the scholia
	are right in identifying Macistus as a mountain in Euboea; the site
	best placed to receive a signal from Peparethos (or even Athos)
	and pass one to Messapium (see next note) is Mt Kandili, which
	stretches above the Euripus shore north-west of the Chalcis narrows.

	to the watchmen of Messapium.

	[c dimgray][sup]65[/sup][/c] like
	the shining moon, came to the crags of Cithaeron, and
	there set in motion its successor stage of the messenger-fire.
	The watch did not refuse the bidding of the light sent

	and the light swooped over Gorgopis bay and came to
	the mountain where goats roam,
	[c dimgray][sup]66[/sup][/c] where it stimulated the

	[c dimgray][sup]67[/sup][/c] the ordinance about the

	[c dimgray][sup]64[/sup][/c]In the territory of the Boeotian port of Anthedon (Strabo

	[c dimgray][sup]65[/sup][/c]The principal river of Boeotia, which separates Thebes
	from Plataea and Mt Cithaeron to the south.
	[c dimgray][sup]66[/sup][/c]This mountain is best identified (see J. H. Quincey, [c dimgray]JHS[/c] 83
	\[1963\] 129–132) with Mt Aegaleos (etymologized as if from αἴξ
	“goat” and ἀλᾶσθαι “wander”) between Athens and Eleusis; the lake or bay (λίμνη) called Gorgopis (“fierce-eyed” or “Gorgon-eyed”)
	will then be the bay of Eleusis. The mountain has also
	been identified with Mt Geraneia on the Megara-Corinth border,
	or with Aegina; but these identifications account less well for
	αἰγίπλαγκτον, and they make the λίμνη and/or the headland of
	306–7 harder to identify plausibly.
	[c dimgray][sup]67[/sup][/c]The transmitted text is corrupt, but this (or “neglect” or the
	like) must be the sense.
	[c dimgray][sup]68[/sup][/c]If the “mountain roamed by goats” is indeed Aegaleos (see
	above), the “headland” will probably be Cape Spiri (see Quincey
	[c dimgray]op.cit.[/c] 132), the most prominent headland between the Isthmus
	and Epidaurus, which overlooks the ferry-route (πορθμός) between
	Epidaurus and Aegina—the same waters that are called the
	πόντος Σαρωνικός in Euripides, [c dimgray]Hippolytus[/c] 1200.

	Today the Achaeans are in possession of Troy. I imagine

	[c dimgray][sup]71[/sup][/c]This was trivially true in ordinary torch-races, where every
	member of the winning team had contributed to the victory and
	would share in its glory. Here, however, there has been no competition,
	and some spectators (though not the chorus) may detect a
	sinister secondary meaning. The fire-message was first started
	on its journey by Agamemnon, and the last to receive it was
	Clytaemestra (cf. 316): the message announced Agamemnon’s
	victory over Troy—and for Clytaemestra it was the signal to prepare
	for the victory we know she will gain over Agamemnon.

	were killed too (most notoriously Priam), and no Trojan father
	mourned his child that day.
	[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c]This implies that in normal circumstances soldiers who
	messed together would be served in some fixed order (perhaps by

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]77[/sup][/c]The Elders will take this to mean either the pain felt by the
	spirits of Greek and Trojan dead who have been left unburied, or
	(more likely, cf. 433–451 below) the pain of Greek families who
	have lost kinsmen in the war; the audience will perceive that by
	“the dead” Clytaemestra means primarily Iphigeneia, and that she
	intends to make sure that an “unexpected stroke of evil fate” [c dimgray]does[/c]
	occur.
	[c dimgray][sup]78[/sup][/c]The mss.’ reading means “awake”, but the context, in particular
	the two conditional clauses each of the form “if \[not “even if”\] all goes well”, requires a statement slanted in the direction of
	safety, not of danger.
	[c dimgray][sup]79[/sup][/c]One could pray to the gods for new blessings and/or for
	the continued enjoyment (ὄνησις) of existing blessings, and we
	sometimes find prayers or wishes for the latter that explicitly exclude
	the former (e.g. Euripides, [c dimgray]Alcestis[/c] 334, [c dimgray]Hecuba[/c] 996–7).
	Clytaemestra professes to regard the safe return of the army (and
	Agamemnon) as so great a boon that, if it is granted, she will be
	content with it and will not desire more. In fact, of course, the
	“enjoyment” she will gain from the return of Agamemnon will be
	of a kind undreamed of by the Elders.

	[c dimgray][sup]84[/sup][/c]The reference is to bronze adulterated with lead, whose

	[c dimgray][sup]85[/sup][/c]i.e. when the criminal is caught and punished, his true character,
	which he had hoped to conceal, becomes evident to all, just
	as “wear and knocking” reveals the true nature of the adulterated
	bronze which, when the vessel was new, had looked no different
	from top-quality metal.
	[c dimgray][sup]86[/sup][/c]i.e. he is attempting the impossible
	(in seeking to evade justice).

	and shamed the table of hospitality
	by stealing away a wife.
	Leaving to her fellow-citizens the turmoil
	of shield-bearing warriors, the setting of ambushes,
	[c dimgray][sup]88[/sup][/c]
	the arming of men to go in ships,
	bringing destruction to Ilium instead of a dowry,
	she went lightly through the gates,
	daring to do what she should not have dared; and the
	seers of the house
	said this, with many a groan:
	“Alas for the house, alas for the house and its chiefs!
	Alas for the bed and the traces of a loving wife!
	[c dimgray][sup]89[/sup][/c]
	One can see the deserted,
	[c dimgray][sup]90[/sup][/c] silent, dishonoured,
	neither reviling nor praying;
	because of his longing for her who is beyond the sea,
	a phantom will seem to rule the house.
	The charm of beautiful statues
	[c dimgray][sup]91[/sup][/c]
	has become hateful to the husband:

	[c dimgray][sup]88[/sup][/c]Or “the forming of companies”.
	[c dimgray][sup]89[/sup][/c]lit. “husband-loving traces” \[or “footsteps”\]; after λέχος,
	the picture likely to be conjured up is that of a marital bed still
	bearing the impress of Helen’s body.
	[c dimgray][sup]90[/sup][/c]In the Greek this is plural, though only Menelaus is referred to; in the immediate shock of loss, he is apparently stunned into
	utter speechlessness.
	[c dimgray][sup]91[/sup][/c]These must surely be statues of Helen, with which Menelaus,
	like many a king in reality and fiction, had adorned his palace
	to remind himself of the beauty of his wife even when for the moment
	she was not actually with him; now they have become a
	mockery and a torment, their dead, painted eyes reminding him
	that the living woman is gone. If, as many scholars believe, the reference
	were to any and all statues of beautiful young women, it
	would not be clear why the sight of [c dimgray]statues[/c] in particular should be
	said to distress Menelaus, rather than that of attractive maidservants
	or even of Helen’s daughter Hermione, which one might
	have thought would be even more powerful reminders of his loss.

	because they lack eyes,
	all their loveliness goes for nothing.
	Mournful imaginings, seen in dreams,
	present themselves, bringing
	an empty delight;
	for it is empty when one sees what seems a blessing
	and then the vision slips aside
	through one’s arms and is gone, never again
	to be a winged companion on the paths of sleep.”
	These, and even worse than these,
	are the sorrows in the house, by the hearth;
	but for all alike of those who started together from the
	land of Greece
	a mourning woman,
	[c dimgray][sup]92[/sup][/c] with a heart that endures
	suffering,
	is the outstanding feature in each man’s home.
	There is much, at any rate, that strikes deep into the

	Ares, the moneychanger of bodies,

	[c dimgray][sup]94[/sup][/c] in the battle of spears,
	sends back from Ilium to their dear ones
	heavy dust
	[c dimgray][sup]95[/sup][/c] that has been through the fire,
	to be sadly wept over,
	filling easily-stowed urns
	with ash given in exchange for men.
	And they lament, and praise this man
	as one expert in battle,
	that man as having fallen nobly amid the slaughter—
	“because of someone else’s wife”.
	That is what they are snarling, under their breath;
	and grief steals over them, mixed with resentment
	against the chief prosecutors,
	[c dimgray][sup]96[/sup][/c] the Atreidae.
	And over there, around the city wall,
	the men in their beauty
	[c dimgray][sup]97[/sup][/c] occupy
	sepulchres in the land of Ilium:
	the enemy’s soil covers its conquerors.

	Hail, soil of my fathers, land of Argos! On this day, after

	[c dimgray][sup]104[/sup][/c] I have come back to you, achieving one
	of my hopes, after the shipwreck of so many: for I never
	thought that I would die in this Argive land and be able to
	share my beloved family tomb. Now greeting to my land,
	\[[c dimgray]raising his hands to sun and sky[/c]\] greeting to the light of
	the sun and to Zeus supreme over the land, to the Pythian
	lord—and please no longer shoot the shafts of your bow
	at us; you showed us quite enough hostility by the Scamander;

	but now, lord Apollo, become a saviour and a

	[c dimgray][sup]107[/sup][/c]Cf. Xenophon, [c dimgray]Cyropaedia[/c] 2.1.1: “They crossed the frontier,
	after praying to the gods and heroes who dwelt in the land of
	Persia to send them forth with favour and kindness; and after
	crossing it, they prayed again to the gods who dwelt in the land of
	Media to receive them with favour and kindness.”
	[c dimgray][sup]108[/sup][/c]lit. “the spear”.
	[c dimgray][sup]109[/sup][/c]This would be understood as referring
	to stone seats outside the palace where the kings sat to receive
	petitions, give judgement, etc.; cf. [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 3.404–416.
	[c dimgray][sup]110[/sup][/c]From Hesychius α5360 (citing Euripides fr. 538) and
	Tertullian, [c dimgray]On Idolatry[/c] 15.6, it appears that δαίμονες (or θεοὶ)
	ἀντήλιοι were divinities who had shrines in front of the entrance
	to a building; perhaps the term was originally applied to shrines in
	front of temples (whose entrances normally faced the rising sun)
	and later generalized. In front of Agamemnon’s palace, as in front of many real Athenian houses, there is certainly a shrine of Apollo
	Agyieus (cf. 1072–87 below) and probably an image of Hermes
	(see note on [c dimgray]Cho[/c]. 583); we do not know whether there are also
	shrines of one or more other deities.
	[c dimgray][sup]111[/sup][/c]The actor no doubt
	delivered the rest of this speech straight at the audience.
	[c dimgray][sup]112[/sup][/c]Here the mss. add “and the altars and the abodes of the
	gods have disappeared”. That this would be an appalling sacrilege
	to commit, let alone to boast of, is not on its own a reason for rejecting
	the line; nor is its close resemblance to [c dimgray]Pers[/c]. 811. However,
	the line interrupts the metaphor of the “mattock of Zeus” which
	works over the ground (526) and destroys the seed in the soil
	(528); and [c dimgray]pace[/c] Murray and others, we do not need 527 to tell us
	that the army has behaved as badly as was feared in 338–344—we
	knew that already (see note on 338–9). The line was probably
	added by a producer or actor for a revival in the late fifth century.
	[c dimgray][sup]113[/sup][/c]This expression, like the mattock itself, is figurative; the
	Trojan “seed” that has been destroyed is Troy’s human population
	(contrast the βροτείων σπερμάτων σωτηρίαν which is to be assured
	to the Athenians, [c dimgray]Eum[/c]. 909).

	army, the gain prevails and the pain does not counterbalance
	it—why should we reckon the lost ones into the account,
	why should the living be expected to grieve over the
	spite of fortune? Indeed, I think it proper to rejoice greatly
	at these events, <and the expedition will now be extolled
	with great praise> which—as it is proper to boast to the

	[c dimgray][sup]122[/sup][/c] “Once upon a time an Argive expedition
	captured Troy, and these are their spoils, given to
	the gods of Greece, nailed up of old to adorn their temples.”
	Having heard such a tale as I have told, you should
	praise the city and its generals; and honour will be given to
	the grace of Zeus which has brought this about. You have

	of the sense of the lines that appear to be missing here; it
	is at any rate highly likely that 577–9, which look back on the capture
	of Troy as an event of the distant past, are neither the army’s
	own boast nor an inscription made at the time when spoils were
	dedicated, but the comment of a visitor who sees one of the dedications
	in a sanctuary (for the thought pattern cf. [c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 7.81–91).

	I raised a cry of triumphant joy long ago, when the first
	nocturnal fire-messenger came, telling of the capture and
	destruction of Ilium; and some rebuked me and said,
	“Have beacon-watchers persuaded you to believe that
	Troy is now a sacked city? How very like a woman, to let
	her heart take flight!” By such words they tried to show me
	up as one deranged; but nevertheless I made sacrifices,
	and throughout the city one person
	[c dimgray][sup]123[/sup][/c] here, another there,
	began loudly raising the auspicious cry of triumph according
	to women’s custom, while they lulled the altar-flames in
	the gods’ abodes by feeding them with sweet-smelling incense.
	And now what need is there for you to tell me about
	it more fully? I shall hear the whole story from the king
	himself. I will make haste to give my honourable husband
	the best possible welcome when he comes home. What
	light could be sweeter than this for a wife to behold, when
	she opens the door to a husband whom god has brought
	safe home from the wars? Report this back to my lord, and
	tell him to come with all speed, for his city passionately desires
	him. May he come to find the wife in his palace just as
	faithful as when he left her, a watchdog of the house,
	friendly to him and hostile to those who wished him ill, and
	loyal

	[c dimgray][sup]126[/sup][/c]χαλκός, strictly “bronze”, can denote any metal used in
	tools and weapons, as in Pindar, [c dimgray]Pythian[/c] 3.48, where it is called
	πολιός—the colour of iron (similarly a χαλκεύς would normally
	be both an iron- and a bronze-worker). Iron was tempered (hardened)
	by being dipped (βαφή) in cold water (cf. [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 9.391–3;
	Sophocles, [c dimgray]Ajax[/c] 650–1); bronze was not. The audience may reflect
	(cf. previous note) that Clytaemestra’s statement is strictly true: if
	she knows at least as much about “dipping metal” as she does
	about “pleasure from another man”, it means she knows quite a lot
	about both—and indeed she soon [c dimgray]will[/c] be “dipping metal” . . . in
	her husband’s blood (cf. [c dimgray]Cho.[/c] 1011).
	[c dimgray][sup]127[/sup][/c]It might be thought unseemly for a woman to make mention
	of sexual matters in public, even in order to proclaim her
	purity; but Clytaemestra claims that she can do so without disgrace
	because (i) she is of noble birth (and so cannot be accused of
	behaving with casual, ignorant recklessness) and (ii) her assertion
	is true. Later (1431–47) she will go a great deal further down this
	road.
	[c dimgray][sup]128[/sup][/c]Evidently an attempt to hint that Clytaemestra’s words
	should be viewed with some suspicion. The Elders know that her
	statement that the city “passionately desires” Agamemnon (605) is
	not true (cf. 445–460); whether they know or suspect anything
	beyond this is not clear.
	[c dimgray][sup]129[/sup][/c]i.e. “I [c dimgray]could[/c] tell you some comforting lies, but you’d find
	out the truth soon anyway.”

	It is not proper to defile a day of good omen by the uttering
	of bad news: the honour due to the gods stands apart from
	that.
	[c dimgray][sup]132[/sup][/c] When a grim-faced messenger brings a city the
	painful news of an army lost, news it had prayed not to receive—that the city has suffered one wound collectively,
	while many men have been taken from many houses as
	sacrificial victims,
	[c dimgray][sup]133[/sup][/c] by the double whip that Ares loves,
	in a two-pronged ruin, in gory double harness
	[c dimgray][sup]134[/sup][/c]—well,
	when someone is loaded down with [c dimgray]that[/c] kind of misery, it
	is fitting to sing this paean to the Furies.
	[c dimgray][sup]135[/sup][/c] But when one is
	coming with good tidings of success to a city rejoicing in
	prosperity—how can I mix together good and evil, by telling
	of the storm that showed no lack of divine anger against
	the Achaeans? Two powers who had formerly been fierce
	enemies, Fire and Sea, made conspiracy together,
	[c dimgray][sup]136[/sup][/c] and
	gave proof of their covenant by destroying the ill-fated
	Argive host. In the night there arose a terrible wave of
	troubles: winds from Thrace,
	[c dimgray][sup]137[/sup][/c] together with lightning,
	[c dimgray][sup]138[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]132[/sup][/c]i.e. by speaking of such things we would dishonour the
	gods who have given us victory (so Triclinius).
	[c dimgray][sup]133[/sup][/c]The “sacrifice” is here metaphorical, the reference being
	to the men in the annihilated army.
	[c dimgray][sup]134[/sup][/c]lit. “a gory pair of chariot-horses”; the duality emphasized in this and the two preceding phrases appears to refer to the public
	and private griefs contrasted in 640–1.
	[c dimgray][sup]135[/sup][/c]This is a “blasphemous paradox” (Fraenkel), since a paean
	is normally a song of joy.
	[c dimgray][sup]136[/sup][/c]Aeschylus suppresses the traditional
	cause of the storm, the wrath of Athena whose temple had
	been violated by the seizure of Cassandra (cf. [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 3.135, [c dimgray]Sack
	of Troy[/c] Arg. 3 West, [c dimgray]Returns[/c] Arg. 1 and 3 West); Athena is never
	mentioned in the first two plays of the [c dimgray]Oresteia[/c]. The idea of a conspiracy
	between old enemies to wreck the Achaean fleet is taken

	[c dimgray][sup]140[/sup][/c] When the brilliant light of the sun came up, we
	saw the Aegean Sea carpeted with the bodies of Achaean
	men and the wreckage of ships. We ourselves, on the other
	hand, and our ship, its hull unscathed, were either smuggled
	out or begged off by some god, no man, who took hold
	of the helm; Fortune in good will took her seat on our ship
	to save us, so that we didn’t have to choose between being
	swamped by the waves at anchor and being wrecked on the
	rock-bound shore.
	[c dimgray][sup]141[/sup][/c] Then, having escaped a watery grave,

	[c dimgray][sup]143[/sup][/c]
	using language with accuracy
	through his foreknowledge of what was fated?—
	to the spear-bride for whom two contended,

	[c dimgray][sup]144[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]142[/sup][/c]Positing a missing line with approximately this sense
	(Murray, Rose; cf. [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 4.569) gives coherence to the passage.
	The mss.’ text would mean “For certainly, first and most, you
	should expect Menelaus to come”; but it offers no reason for this
	confident prediction, after a storm in which thousands have perished
	and which, so far as is known, only one ship got through
	safely.
	[c dimgray][sup]143[/sup][/c]i.e. a divine being.
	[c dimgray][sup]144[/sup][/c]In the Greek the pun is on ἑλεῖν which can mean both
	“capture” and “kill, destroy”: Helen caused the destruction of
	ships, the slaughter of men, and the capture of Troy.
	[c dimgray][sup]145[/sup][/c]This will probably be understood as referring to curtains

	[c dimgray][sup]149[/sup][/c]The lesser of Troy’s two rivers, the other being the Scamander
	(511). The Scamander (Menderes) now divides into two
	branches before reaching the sea, and the Simois (Dümrek) joins
	the more easterly branch; but in classical times it was believed
	(Herodotus 2. 10; cf. Strabo 13.1.36), notwithstanding [c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 5.774, that at the time of the Trojan War much of the lower plain had
	been under water, so that the Simois would have reached the sea
	separately. See J. M. Cook in L. Foxhall and J. K. Davies ed. [c dimgray]The
	Trojan War[/c] (Liverpool, 1984) 163–7.
	[c dimgray][sup]150[/sup][/c]Because Strife (Eris) by her nature delights in conflict, but
	also with reference to her provocation of the quarrel between
	Athena, Hera and Aphrodite that led to the Judgement of Paris
	and hence to his abduction of Helen (cf. [c dimgray]Cypria[/c] Arg. 1 West).
	[c dimgray][sup]151[/sup][/c]In the Greek the play is on two senses of κῆδος, “marriage-bond”
	(between two families) and “mourning”.
	[c dimgray][sup]152[/sup][/c]lit. “inclined the scale for”.
	[c dimgray][sup]153[/sup][/c]I translate West’s tentative conjecture; the transmitted
	reading involves a pointless redundancy (ὑμέναιον says nothing
	that was not already said by τὸ νυμότιμον μέλος) and a metrical
	anomaly.

	What a god had caused to be reared as an inmate of the

	[c dimgray][sup]157[/sup][/c] of Ruin.

	a gentle adornment of wealth,
	a soft glance darted from the eyes,
	a flower of love to pierce the soul.
	But she swerved aside and brought about

	[c dimgray][sup]158[/sup][/c]The weeping brides are both Trojan (cf. 326–7) and Greek

	But I differ from others, and have a belief of my own:
	[c dimgray][sup]159[/sup][/c]
	it is the impious deed
	that breeds more to follow,
	resembling their progenitors;
	for a house that keeps the straight path of justice
	breeds a fortune that is always fair.
	An old act of outrage is wont
	to give birth to a new young outrage,
	which flourishes amid men’s suffering,
	[c dimgray][sup]160[/sup][/c]
	at this time or at that, when there comes
	the proper day for its birth,
	and to the deity with whom none can war or fight,
	the unholy arrogance
	of Ruin, black for the house,
	in the likeness of her parents.
	But Justice shines out
	in smoky hovels,
	and honours the righteous man:

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]159[/sup][/c]There is nothing new about the belief now to be stated; it
	appears several times in the poems of Solon (frr. 4.7–9, 6.3–4,
	13.7–16 West). However, the belief that the gods are amorally
	jealous of human prosperity as such remained widespread, and
	a generation after Aeschylus it is prominent in Herodotus (e.g.
	1.32.1, 3.40, 7.10ε).

	and for the punishment I have exacted from the city of

	but through men’s deaths,
	[c dimgray][sup]169[/sup][/c] and without division of opinion
	cast their votes in the urn of blood for the destruction
	of Troy; to the vessel on the other side only hope approached—
	no hand filled it. Even now the smoke rising
	from the city proclaims it fallen; the gusts of ruin are still
	alive and blowing, and the ashes, reluctant to die down,
	send forth thick puffs of wealth. For this we must be
	deeply mindful of the gods’ favour and pay them thanks,
	since we have punished that arrogant abduction, and on
	account of a woman a city has been ground into dust by the
	Argive beast, the offspring of the Horse, the shield-bearing
	host which made its jump
	[c dimgray][sup]170[/sup][/c] about the time of the setting
	of the Pleiades;
	[c dimgray][sup]171[/sup][/c] a lion, eater of raw flesh, leaped

	[c dimgray][sup]169[/sup][/c]The whole Trojan war is imaged as a trial in court (cf. 40–41),
	with the two sides putting their cases not by making speeches
	but by fighting and dying.
	[c dimgray][sup]170[/sup][/c]The immediate reference is to the dangerously long leap
	from the belly of the gigantic Wooden Horse (cf. [c dimgray]Sack of Troy[/c] fr. 1 West) to the ground below, apparently called “the Trojan leap” in
	Euripides, [c dimgray]Andromache[/c] 1139; see E. K. Borthwick, [c dimgray]JHS[/c] 87 (1967)
	18–23. In the next line, however, the leap metamorphoses into the
	spring of a lion over Troy’s walls and on to its prey.
	[c dimgray][sup]171[/sup][/c]In early November, when the Pleiades could first be seen
	setting before sunrise (the phrase cannot denote a particular time
	of the night, because neither the Pleiades nor any other group of
	stars set at a fixed time of the night). This casual reference to the
	time of year—which moreover contradicts the usual tradition that
	Troy fell in the month of Thargelion (May/June), a tradition already
	found in fifth-century sources (Damastes fr. 7 Fowler,
	Hellanicus fr. 152 Fowler)—is best accounted for by noting that
	the setting of the Pleiades heralded the stormy season when sailing
	was dangerous (Hesiod, [c dimgray]Works and Days[/c] 619–629; cf. on 5–7
	above), so that by setting sail for home immediately after sacking
	the city Agamemnon was asking for trouble—which he duly got.

	prelude I have addressed to the gods. \[[c dimgray]To the chorus[/c]\] As
	for your thoughts, I remember well what you told me, I say
	the same, and you have my full concurrence. Few men
	have it in their nature to honour a friend who is enjoying
	good fortune, without being jealous of him. When a man
	has an affliction, the poison of ill-will sits close to his heart
	and doubles his burden: he is weighed down by his own
	sufferings, and he also grieves to see the success of another.
	I can say with knowledge—for I am very well acquainted
	with the mirror of social relations
	[c dimgray][sup]172[/sup][/c]—that <the
	loyalty of friends is> a mere shadowy phantom. <I know
	that many of the leaders of my army were really my jealous
	enemies,> though to all appearance they were very
	friendly to me.
	[c dimgray][sup]173[/sup][/c] Only Odysseus, the one who sailed
	against his will,
	[c dimgray][sup]174[/sup][/c] proved himself, once yoked, my willing
	right-hand man
	[c dimgray][sup]175[/sup][/c]—whether it is a dead or a living man
	that I am speaking of. As regards other matters concerning
	the community and the gods, we will hold public assemblies
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]172[/sup][/c]Social intercourse is called a “mirror” because a person’s
	social behaviour reveals his true inner nature and feelings as faithfully
	and unflatteringly as a mirror reveals his true outward appearance.
	[c dimgray][sup]173[/sup][/c]On the need to posit a lacuna here, see H. D. F. Kitto, [c dimgray]Form
	and Meaning in Drama[/c] (London, 1956) 23 n.2. Agamemnon is evidently
	thinking primarily of Achilles and Ajax, but his statement that [c dimgray]only[/c] Odysseus was truly loyal is likely to have been perceived
	by the audience as grossly unjust to most of his other colleagues.
	[c dimgray][sup]174[/sup][/c]Odysseus feigned madness in order to avoid joining the
	expedition, but Palamedes contrived a stratagem that proved he
	was actually sane ([c dimgray]Cypria[/c] Arg. 5 West).
	[c dimgray][sup]175[/sup][/c]lit. “trace-horse”. In classical times, a chariot team consisted
	either of two horses (yoked to the chariot) or of four; in
	the latter case, the outer horses were controlled by traces, and
	their power and speed (especially that of the horse on the driver’s
	right) were vital to the team when rounding bends (cf. Sophocles,
	[c dimgray]Electra[/c] 721–2). In Homer, trace-horses are mentioned only occasionally
	([c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 8.81–88, 16.152) and there is never more than one
	in a team.

	to count than a net has; while if he’d been killed as often as
	the stories claimed, he’d have had to have three bodies—a
	second Geryon
	[c dimgray][sup]178[/sup][/c]—and could boast that he had donned a
	threefold cloak of earth, having died once in each of his
	persons. Because of dire reports like these, many a noose
	hung from above was untied from my neck by others after I
	had been seized and held by force.
	[c dimgray][sup]179[/sup][/c] That, you will understand,
	is why our son is not standing here by my side, the
	holder of our mutual pledges, as he ought to be—Orestes.
	Don’t be surprised by this. He is being brought up by a
	friend bound to us by hospitality and alliance, Strophius
	the Phocian,
	[c dimgray][sup]180[/sup][/c] who plainly pointed out to me two potential
	disasters—the danger you were in at Troy, and the possibility
	that the clamorous populace, in the absence of a
	ruler, might hatch a wicked plot
	[c dimgray][sup]181[/sup][/c]—and said it was part of
	human nature to kick a man a bit more when he was down.
	In an explanation such as this there can be no deception.

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]178[/sup][/c]Geryon was a triple-bodied monster. Heracles’ tenth labour
	was to steal his cattle, and (as much early artistic evidence
	shows) he had to slay each one of Geryon’s bodies separately; see
	T. R. Gantz, [c dimgray]Early Greek Myth[/c] (Baltimore, 1993) 402–3.
	[c dimgray][sup]179[/sup][/c]The rescuers are imagined as finding Clytaemestra just in
	time to save her; some of them hold her up, despite her resistance
	(implied by πρὸς βίαν), while others cut the rope and then undo
	the noose.
	[c dimgray][sup]180[/sup][/c]Strophius was a brother-in-law of Agamemnon’s (Euripides,
	[c dimgray]Iphigeneia in Tauris[/c] 917–8; Pausanias 2.29.4); his son Pylades
	appears in the next play.
	[c dimgray][sup]181[/sup][/c]The twin dangers were (i) that Agamemnon might be killed
	and (ii) that his mere absence might make possible a popular revolution
	and the overthrow of the dynasty; in either case the child
	Orestes would be in mortal peril.

	Well, in my eyes the gushing fountains of tears have dried
	up, and there is not a drop left; and I have damaged those
	eyes by lying late awake, weeping for the beacon-sites set
	up to signal your return
	[c dimgray][sup]182[/sup][/c] which always remained idle.
	And amid my dreams I kept being awakened by the light
	buzz of a trumpeting mosquito,
	[c dimgray][sup]183[/sup][/c] having seen more sufferings
	afflict you than could fit into the time they shared
	my bed. Now, after enduring all this, with a heart no longer
	grieving, I shall speak of this man as the watchdog of his
	homestead, the forestay
	[c dimgray][sup]184[/sup][/c] that saves the ship, the firmly-footed
	pillar that supports a lofty roof, a father’s only
	son;
	[c dimgray][sup]185[/sup][/c] as land appearing to sailors in despair, as the daylight
	that is such a fair thing to behold after a storm, as a
	flowing spring to a thirsty traveller. Such, I say, are the appellations
	I hold him worthy of—but let us not court jealousy,

	[c dimgray][sup]186[/sup][/c] for we have endured many sufferings already. Now
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]182[/sup][/c]lit. “the torch-holding places concerning you”.
	[c dimgray][sup]183[/sup][/c]This seemingly oxymoronic expression was well explained
	by W. S. Barrett (ap. Fraenkel iii 630): the buzz is [c dimgray]objectively[/c]
	“light” and has, in Barrett’s words, “no business to wake a healthy
	sleeper”, but once it has awakened the restless Clytaemestra she
	finds it much too loud for her to have any chance of getting back to
	sleep.
	[c dimgray][sup]184[/sup][/c]One of two ropes, secured to the prow of a ship, by which
	the mast was raised and lowered; if they broke in a storm (as in
	[c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 12.409–410) the mast would collapse, often with catastrophic
	results. See J. S. Morrison and R. T. Williams, [c dimgray]Greek
	Oared Ships 900–322[/c]
	bc (Cambridge, 1968) 55.
	[c dimgray][sup]185[/sup][/c]Agamemnon is not, of course, an only son; this phrase, like
	the previous three, metaphorically describes him as one on whom
	depends the whole safety of the house and/or the city. The following
	three expressions (899–901) make a slightly different point,
	describing him as one who [c dimgray]brings[/c] safety after peril.
	[c dimgray][sup]186[/sup][/c]lit. “let (sc. divine) jealousy be absent”: if such jealousy
	were to be aroused by presumptuous speech, the gods might be
	provoked into inflicting yet further sufferings. Having said this,
	Clytaemestra immediately sets out to tempt Agamemnon into acting
	in the way most likely to arouse divine jealousy!

	[c dimgray][sup]187[/sup][/c]lit. “dear head”.
	[c dimgray][sup]188[/sup][/c]The fabric is later spoken of as “clothing” (921, 963); it is
	evidently fine in texture and richly embroidered (923, 926, 936),
	and might have served either as a garment of exceptional luxury
	or as a wall-hanging (the literal meaning of πετάσματα, here
	rendered “fine fabrics”). It should on no account be spoken or
	thought of as a “carpet”: carpets are made to be trodden on,
	whereas this fabric will be ruined, its beauty and value destroyed,
	even by the single, brief passage over it of Agamemnon’s unshod
	feet (948–9, cf. 958–963).
	[c dimgray][sup]189[/sup][/c]Or “that never hoped to see him”. For Agamemnon “Justice”
	will allude to his war of revenge on Paris and Troy; but
	Clytaemestra is thinking of the revenge [c dimgray]she[/c] is about to take.
	[c dimgray][sup]190[/sup][/c]I translate Karsten’s conjecture, which introduces a word
	not otherwise found in tragedy but at least gives more or less the
	sense required; the transmitted reading, “fated”, goes very badly
	with the emphasis placed in 912 on careful, wakeful thought.
	[c dimgray][sup]191[/sup][/c]The point is (i) that a man should not be publicly praised by
	a member of his own family (cf. Pindar fr. 181), since their praise
	might be thought to stem merely from affection or deference, and
	perhaps also (ii) that it is unseemly for a woman to make public
	speeches.

	[c dimgray][sup]196[/sup][/c]i.e. if an authoritative interpreter of the divine will (such as

	[c dimgray][sup]197[/sup][/c]Agamemnon is seeking to close down the argument by

	[c dimgray][sup]198[/sup][/c]i.e. a man who has won such great victories will not be disgraced

	Well, if that’s what you want, let someone quickly take off

	[c dimgray][sup]200[/sup][/c] may no jealous

	impropriety about despoiling this house under my feet,
	ruining its wealth and the woven work bought with its
	silver. Well, so much for that. \[[c dimgray]His shoes having now been
	removed, he descends from the carriage, but does not yet
	step on the fabrics. He gestures towards cassandra[/c].\] This
	foreign woman—please welcome her kindly. He who exercises
	power gently is regarded graciously by god from afar.
	No one wears the yoke of slavery willingly; and this woman
	has come with me as a gift from the army, the choice flower
	of its rich booty. Now, since I have been subjugated into
	obeying you in this, I will go, treading on purple, to the
	halls of my house.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]199[/sup][/c]Cf. Sophocles, [c dimgray]Ajax[/c] 1353 (also addressed to Agamemnon):
	“You are still the master, you know, if you let your friends vanquish
	you.”
	[c dimgray][sup]200[/sup][/c]I translate Wecklein’s tentative conjecture. The transmitted
	reading, “these purple-dyed objects of the gods”, is open to the objections (i) that there is no other indication that the fabrics
	are the sacred property of the gods (indeed, 948–9 and 958–962
	imply that they belong to the family), (ii) that if the act of treading
	on the fabrics were to be seen as sacrilegious as well as arrogant,
	one would have expected Agamemnon to mention this somewhere
	in 918–930, and (iii) that the adjective ἁλουργής is not
	used as a noun in the classical period to denote a purple-dyed object
	but only to denote the colour purple (the word for a purple
	garment is ἁλουργίς, and Aeschylus could here, if he wished,
	have written ταῖσδ᾿ . . . ἁλουργίσιν).

	<span class="stage">\[[c dimgray]as agamemnon[/c] walks slowly over the fabrics towards the
	palace door\]There is a sea—who will ever dry it up?—which breeds an
	ever-renewed ooze of abundant purple,
	[c dimgray][sup]201[/sup][/c] worth its weight
	in silver,
	[c dimgray][sup]202[/sup][/c] to dye clothing with. So with the gods’ help, my
	lord, we can remedy this loss; our house does not know
	what poverty is.
	[c dimgray][sup]203[/sup][/c] To contrive a means of bringing this
	man back alive, I would have vowed to trample [c dimgray]many[/c] garments,
	if that had been prescribed to our family in an
	oracle. For while the root remains, foliage comes to a
	house,
	[c dimgray][sup]204[/sup][/c] spreading shade over it against the dog-star
	Sirius;
	[c dimgray][sup]205[/sup][/c] and likewise, now you have come to the hearth of
	our home, your coming signifies warmth in winter, while
	when Zeus is making wine out of the sour young grapes,
	[c dimgray][sup]206[/sup][/c]
	even then it is cool in the house, when the man who is its
	lord is present in his home. \[[c dimgray]
	agamemnon[/c] disappears into
	the palace. clytaemestra raises her hands to heaven.\]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]201[/sup][/c]The dye is made from the secretions of one or more of
	several Mediterranean molluscs, notably [c dimgray]Haustellum[/c] (formerly
	[c dimgray]Murex) brandaris[/c] and [c dimgray]Hexaplex[/c] (formerly [c dimgray]Murex) trunculus.[/c]
	[c dimgray][sup]202[/sup][/c]Cf. Theopompus, [c dimgray]FGrH[/c] 115 F 117.
	[c dimgray][sup]203[/sup][/c]Clytaemestra is responding to Agamemnon’s concern
	about “despoiling this house” (948–9): the sea will never run short of purple, and despite its high price the family (god willing) will
	never run short of resources with which to buy it.
	[c dimgray][sup]204[/sup][/c]Agamemnon—long absent, sometimes despaired of, but
	alive—is compared to a great tree that may be drastically pruned,
	struck by lightning, etc., but which, so long as it has not actually
	been killed, can grow back to its old glory. A similar image appears
	in the account of Clytaemestra’s dream in Sophocles, [c dimgray]Electra[/c] 417–
	423.
	[c dimgray][sup]205[/sup][/c]The dog-days of late July and August, when Sirius begins to
	rise before the sun, are the hottest time of the year.
	[c dimgray][sup]206[/sup][/c]i.e. in summer; the time of vintage is at the morning rising
	of Arcturus (Hesiod, [c dimgray]Works and Days[/c] 609–611) in mid-September.

	And my inwards, my heart whirling

	vain.
	[c dimgray][sup]213[/sup][/c]
	I pray that this may be proved false
	and fall away from my expectation
	into the realm of the unfulfilled.
	Be sure that an end will come, and very soon,
	to insatiable pursuit of fitness
	[c dimgray][sup]214[/sup][/c]—disease
	is a neighbour that presses hard on the party-wall;

	[c dimgray][sup]213[/sup][/c]In rough paraphrase: my rational certainty that wrong will
	not go unpunished, that justice will surely be fulfilled, communicates
	itself to my emotions and sets them in turmoil.
	[c dimgray][sup]214[/sup][/c]The text is corrupt (it differs widely in metre from the
	mostly sound antistrophe), but the meaning must be approximately
	as above; the same point is made in the Hippocratic [c dimgray]Aphorisms[/c]
	(1.3), “In athletes a high state of physical fitness is dangerous
	if taken to an extreme”. Modern medicine agrees: “Excessive
	exercise, such as is undertaken by \[athletes\] preparing for the
	Olympic Games . . . far from improving the ability to overcome infection,
	reduces this capability . . . \[because\] the heavy training
	will have battered their immune system and their white-cell
	counts will have been reduced” (Dr T. Stuttaford, [c dimgray]Times 2[/c] \[26 May
	2005\] p.7).
	[c dimgray][sup]215[/sup][/c]Comparison with the antistrophe shows that seven syllables
	have been lost from the text.

	from a sling of generous dimensions,
	[c dimgray][sup]216[/sup][/c]
	the whole house does not founder
	when crammed too full in surfeit,
	nor does he wreck the ship:
	the gifts of Zeus are surely great, coming abundantly
	from furrows teeming year after year
	to destroy the plague of hunger.
	But once the black blood of death
	has fallen on the earth in front of a man,
	who by any incantation can summon it back again?
	Not even he who knew aright
	how to bring men back from the dead
	[c dimgray][sup]217[/sup][/c]
	was permitted to do so by Zeus without coming to
	harm.
	[c dimgray][sup]218[/sup][/c]

	by the gods, prevents another destiny
	from getting more than its due,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]216[/sup][/c]The ship is envisaged as having run on to the reef because
	it is too heavily laden, and as being refloated by jettisoning part of
	its cargo. It represents in metaphor a house that has become excesively
	rich (cf. 376ff) and is saved from disaster by giving up
	part of its possessions: the family may for a while be in straitened
	circumstances, but a few good harvests (1014–6) can set things right. The “sling” is probably nothing more sophisticated than
	a large piece of sailcloth or the like, in which two men could
	carry heavy items of cargo, and from which they could throw them
	overboard with enough horizontal momentum to avoid fouling or
	damaging the side of the ship.
	[c dimgray][sup]217[/sup][/c]Asclepius (here envisaged as a hero, not a god—as always
	in Athens before the 420s); when he raised, or attempted to raise,
	one or more men from the dead (scarcely any two sources agree
	on the beneficiary’s identity), Zeus destroyed him with a thunderbolt.
	See E. J. and L. Edelstein, [c dimgray]Asclepius[/c] (Baltimore, 1945) i 37–
	48, ii 39–53.
	[c dimgray][sup]218[/sup][/c]I translate West’s emendation, which, though not entirely
	convincing, gives better sense than other proposed corrections of
	the unmetrical reading of the manuscripts.

	and the closely parallel story of Harpagus and Astyages in
	Herodotus 1.119.4.

	[c dimgray][sup]236[/sup][/c]It is not clear whether the last line describes a second thing

	the children are bewailing (parallel to “their slaughter”); for the

	be holding in their hands the flesh and offals of their own bodies
	which their father ate.
	[c dimgray][sup]237[/sup][/c]lit. “what is (she) scheming?”; the Greek text, here and in
	1103, leaves the subject unexpressed and is thus able to avoid disclosing
	the gender of the schemer, and, as Fraenkel recommends,
	I have used the English passive to reproduce this vagueness. The
	verb μήδεται, used twice in this strophe, may suggest a possible
	etymology of the name Κλυται-μήστρα as “famous schemer”.

	[c dimgray][sup]238[/sup][/c]The audience probably will not be able to interpret this sinister

	down to pick up the robe which she is about to throw over Agamemnon.
	[c dimgray][sup]239[/sup][/c]For the association between the women’s
	cry of triumph (ὀλολυγμός) and sacrifices, see on 28. Here the “sacrifice” is metaphorical, and blasphemous.
	[c dimgray][sup]240[/sup][/c]Cf. 1615–
	6 where the chorus predict that Aegisthus will be stoned by the
	enraged people for his part in Agamemnon’s murder.
	[c dimgray][sup]241[/sup][/c]i.e. “I am as pale with terror as a mortally wounded warrior.”
	Cf. [c dimgray]Cho[/c]. 183–4 where Electra, “stricken as if transfixed by a
	weapon”, says there is “a surge of bile close to \[her\] heart”. There
	were thought to be two kinds of bile, yellow and black; the bile set
	in motion by fear was the yellow variety. The Hippocratic treatise
	[c dimgray]On Diseases[/c] (2.5) says that “fainting occurs when phlegm or bile

	[c dimgray][sup]246[/sup][/c]For the story of the nightingale, see [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] 60–67, with
	notes. The adjective ἀμφιθαλής denotes properly a child who has

	to remind us that one of his parents killed him and the other ate

	What you have uttered now follows on from what went
	before,
	and some divinity that wishes you ill
	is assailing you very heavily and causing you
	to sing of woeful, deadly sufferings;
	I am at a loss how it will end.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]cassandra[/b][/c]
	Well, now my prophecies will no longer be looking through
	a veil like a newly-wedded bride; rather you may expect
	that it will sweep down from the sunrise
	[c dimgray][sup]250[/sup][/c] like a bright
	fresh wind, so that there will break upon the beach,
	[c dimgray][sup]251[/sup][/c] so to
	speak, a wave of sorrow far greater than this one.
	[c dimgray][sup]252[/sup][/c] No
	longer will I give you information through riddles. I want
	you to testify that I am following close on the scent of evils
	perpetrated in former times. There is a group of singers
	that never leaves this house. They sing in unison, but not
	pleasantly, for their words speak of evil. Moreover, this
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]250[/sup][/c]The mss. have “towards the sunrise”; see J. Lavery, [c dimgray]Hermes[/c]
	132 (2004) 12–13.
	[c dimgray][sup]251[/sup][/c]The mss. have “against the sun’s rays”, and editors refer to
	the beautiful simile of Catullus (64.269–277) describing the sight
	of morning sunlight shinig through waves raised by a west wind; but here, as the end of the sentence shows, the waves are being
	thought of not as a thing of beauty but as a potentially harmful
	force of nature. It was almost inevitable that the rare word ἀγὰς
	(cf. Sophocles fr. 969, Apollonius Rhodius 1.554) would be corrupted
	into the common αὐγὰς when the sun had been mentioned
	only two lines earlier.
	[c dimgray][sup]252[/sup][/c]his is usually taken to mean that Cassandra’s second utterance
	of her prophecies will pain the Elders more than the first
	because it will be more clearly understood; but it may instead, or
	additionally, foreshadow a future, climactic crime which she has
	not yet mentioned—the matricide of Orestes (1279–84, 1317–26),
	which she will call “the coping-stone \[of\] these disasters for
	the family”.

	[c dimgray][sup]256[/sup][/c]The bed was the marital bed of Atreus; its defiler was his

	[c dimgray][sup]257[/sup][/c]Like the mendicant priests and prophets who “go to the
	doors of the rich and try to persuade them that they have a power
	vouchsafed by the gods” to effect, for a small fee, the forgiveness
	of their sins, the harming of their enemies, etc. (Plato, [c dimgray]Republic[/c]
	364b-c). Cassandra will later say that in Troy she was regarded as
	just such a person (1273–4).
	[c dimgray][sup]258[/sup][/c]Cassandra is challenging the Elders to deny on oath, if they
	can, that they know she is telling the truth about the past events to
	which she has referred; of course they cannot, and they accordingly
	decline to take the oath (1198–9). The exchange is designed
	to recall a procedural device of the Athenian lawcourts. In the
	fourth century, a person who was called as a witness, but did not
	want to confirm the statement prepared for him by the litigant
	who had called him, was required to declare on oath that he did
	not know the statement to be true (with a fine of 1000 drachmae if
	he refused); see C. Carey, [c dimgray]CQ[/c] 45 (1995) 114–9. This procedure
	cannot have existed in quite this form in the fifth century, when
	witnesses, rather than merely confirming statements drawn up in
	advance, answered oral questions and could be invited to speak [c dimgray]ad
	libitum[/c] (cf. Andocides 1.14, 69); but it is likely enough that when a
	witness refused to confirm a proposition put to him, he could be
	challenged to swear that he did not know the proposition to be
	true.

	\[[c dimgray]Pointing wildly[/c]\] Do you see these young ones, sitting near

	at the hands of enemies,
	[c dimgray][sup]261[/sup][/c] their hands conspicuously filled
	with the flesh on which their close kin fed, holding the
	offals and entrails—a most pitiable burden—which their

	[c dimgray][sup]260[/sup][/c]I translate A. Y. Campbell’s conjecture; the true text cannot

	[c dimgray][sup]261[/sup][/c]i.e. “having obviously died by violence”; but ὡσπερεί also
	betrays Cassandra’s knowledge—which the audience share—that
	the children were in fact killed by a φίλος.
	[c dimgray][sup]262[/sup][/c]Aegisthus, here for the first time clearly alluded to; the Elders,
	taunting him in 1625–7, similarly link his adultery, his failure
	to join the Trojan expedition, and his planning of the murder.
	[c dimgray][sup]263[/sup][/c]I translate my tentative conjecture. The transmitted reading,
	“lion”, curiously anticipating L. Frank Baum’s [c dimgray]The Wonderful
	Wizard of Oz[/c], probably derives from a marginal note comparing
	this passage to 1258–9.

	now. How else could anyone, pursuing hostilities against
	enemies who think they are friends, set up their hunting-nets
	[c dimgray][sup]293[/sup][/c]
	to a height too great to overleap? This showdown
	was something that had long been in my thoughts, arising
	from a long-standing grievance; now it has come—at long
	last. I stand where I struck, with my work accomplished. I
	did it this way—I won’t deny it—so that he could neither
	escape death nor defend himself. I staked out around him
	an endless net,
	[c dimgray][sup]294[/sup][/c] as one does for fish—a wickedly opulent
	garment. Then I struck him twice, and on the spot, in the
	space of two cries, his limbs gave way; and when he had
	fallen I added a third stroke, in thanksgiving to the Zeus
	of the underworld,
	[c dimgray][sup]295[/sup][/c] the saviour of the dead, for the fulfilment
	of my prayers. Thus, having fallen, he forced out
	his own soul,
	[c dimgray][sup]296[/sup][/c] and he coughed up a sharp spurt of blood
	and hit me with a black shower of gory dew
	[c dimgray][sup]297[/sup][/c]—at which I

	[c dimgray][sup]294[/sup][/c]From other descriptions of the robe/net ([c dimgray]Cho.[/c] 980–4, 997–1004;
	[c dimgray]Eum.[/c] 634–5) we gather that it was thrown over Agamemnon
	like a tent and covered him completely, that it fettered his hands and hobbled his feet, and that it was the sort of device that a robber
	might use. This strongly suggests, as do other fifth-century
	references to this robe (Sophocles fr. 526; Euripides, [c dimgray]Orestes[/c] 25—
	both of which also call the robe “endless”), that it is imagined as
	something like what is already shown, a decade or so before the
	[c dimgray]Oresteia[/c], on the Dokimasia Painter’s krater (Boston 63.1246 = A6
	Prag), in which Agamemnon is completely enveloped in a delicate
	garment that has no holes for his head or arms (though his feet
	seem to have considerable freedom of movement).
	[c dimgray][sup]295[/sup][/c]i.e. Hades/Pluto (cf. [c dimgray]Supp[/c]. 156–7, 230–1). The collocation
	τρίτην . . . Διὸς . . . σωτῆρος links this bloodthirsty action, blasphemously,
	to the third libation after a feast (see on [c dimgray]Supp[/c]. 26).
	[c dimgray][sup]296[/sup][/c]i.e. his last breaths were hard, spasmodic pants.
	[c dimgray][sup]297[/sup][/c]his passage is imitated by Sophocles, [c dimgray]Antigone[/c] 1238–9
	(where the blood is that of the dying Haemon embracing the
	already dead Antigone).

	Your cunning is great,

	is driven mad by your experience of flowing blood
	[c dimgray][sup]303[/sup][/c]—

	You will now also hear this righteous oath I swear: by the

	the Fury, through whose aid I slew this man, no fearful apprehension
	stalks my house, so long as the fire upon my
	hearth is kindled by Aegisthus and he remains loyal to me
	as hitherto; for he is an ample shield of confidence for me.
	Here lies this abuser of his wife,
	[c dimgray][sup]304[/sup][/c] the charmer of Chryseis
	and the rest
	[c dimgray][sup]305[/sup][/c] at Troy, and with him this captive, this

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]303[/sup][/c]The point of “just as” is that the Elders see Clytaemestra’s
	arrogant words as being caused by her mental derangement (as in 1407ff they supposed that her actions and attitude resulted from
	taking a noxious drug).
	[c dimgray][sup]304[/sup][/c]lit. “the abuser of this woman”
	(meaning herself)—an expression that would normally be applied
	to a rapist or to the seducer of a married woman (cf. [c dimgray]Cho.[/c] 764 \[of
	Aegisthus!\]; Euripides, [c dimgray]Hippolytus[/c] 1068, [c dimgray]Bacchae[/c] 354).
	[c dimgray][sup]305[/sup][/c]lit. “the Chryseises”, i.e. Chryseis ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 1.11–120, 430–457) and other captive women.
	[c dimgray][sup]306[/sup][/c]lit. “mast-rubber”, where
	ἱστός “mast” is metaphorical as in Strabo’s tale (8.6.20) of the
	Corinthian [c dimgray]hetaera[/c] who said, when taunted with the fact that she
	did no proper work, “I’ve lowered three ἱστοί before now in

	Ah, if only some fate could swiftly come—

	our most kindly guardian,

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]307[/sup][/c]This is the earliest known reference to the belief, evidently

	has close associations with Apollo) sings just before it dies.
	[c dimgray][sup]308[/sup][/c]The Greek word is masculine in form, insinuating that Cassandra
	was the dominant partner and/or that Agamemnon had
	something effeminate about him.
	[c dimgray][sup]309[/sup][/c]The transmitted text means, if it means anything, “has
	brought a side-dish to my bed, to the pleasure in which I luxuriate”;
	probably, as Fraenkel suggests, εὐνῆς “bed” was a mistaken
	gloss on χλιδῆς “luxuriant pleasure” (which here denotes the
	pleasure, not of sex, but of revenge), perhaps displacing an adjective
	agreeing with παροψώνημα.

	16.260 of boys provoking wasps to swarm from their nest). For

	[c dimgray][sup]317[/sup][/c]The food that fattens it is probably to be understood as

	([c dimgray]loc. cit[/c]. and 1065–74) it refers literally to the successive murders

	Ió, ió, my king, my king,

	no, the ancient, bitter avenging spirit

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]320[/sup][/c]Clytaemestra first criticizes the chorus for believing that
	she (i.e. Agamemnon’s wife) is Agamemnon’s murderer, and then
	tells them not to believe that she (i.e. Agamemnon’s murderer) is
	Agamemnon’s wife; this contradiction is doubtless deliberate on
	the poet’s part, drawing attention (as the chorus will, more directly,
	in 1505–7) to the sheer incoherence of any attempt to deny
	her guilt.

	Insult comes in return for insult,

	You have struck on this oracular saying
	with truth; but be that as it may,
	I am willing to make a sworn agreement
	with the spirit of the Pleisthenids
	[c dimgray][sup]327[/sup][/c]
	that I will be content with what has happened,
	hard though it is to endure, but that for the future it
	should leave

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]327[/sup][/c]Pleisthenes is a shadowy name in the family to which Agamemnon
	belongs, found at several different points in its genealogy
	(see Gantz 552–6). Most often, Pleisthenes is a son of Atreus
	who dies young and whose children, Agamemnon and Menelaus, are brought up by Atreus who comes to be regarded as their father.
	However, on the version of events that is assumed in this play,
	the curse or evil spirit originated not with this Pleisthenes but
	with Atreus (and Thyestes), and both this passage and 1602 will
	make most sense if “Pleisthenes” is assumed to be here merely
	an alternative name for Atreus himself (cf. the doubly named
	Paris/Alexander); such an equation will have been encouraged by
	the practice of some lyric poets (Ibycus, [c dimgray]PMG[/c] 282; Bacchylides
	15.6, 48) who speak of Agamemnon and/or Menelaus both as
	“Pleisthenids” and as “Atreids” or “sons of Atreus”.

	plainly

	and secured himself safety from death and from staining

	[c dimgray][sup]329[/sup][/c] served him with a meal of his

	sitting each by himself, so that it was unrecognizable;
	[c dimgray][sup]331[/sup][/c]
	and Thyestes at once, in ignorance, took some of it and
	ate it, a meal that, as you now see, was ruinous for the
	family. Then, when he recognized the unrighteous deed,
	he howled aloud, fell backwards while vomiting out the
	slaughtered remains, and called down an unendurable fate
	on the house of Pelops,
	[c dimgray][sup]332[/sup][/c] kicking over the table to chime
	with his curse: “So perish all the race of Pleisthenes!” It is
	because of this, you see, that you now behold this man
	fallen. And I was rightfully entitled to contrive this slaying.
	I was my wretched father’s third child; Atreus spared me
	and drove me out together with him, when I was a tiny infant
	in swaddling clothes. When I grew up, Justice brought
	me back again, and I laid hands on this man though I
	was not present, fitting together every device to plan his
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]331[/sup][/c]This passage is badly corrupt. Key considerations in restoring
	and interpreting it are, firstly, that it cannot have been only the
	hands and feet that were “chopped up . . . so \[ as to be\] unrecognizable”—hence something must have been lost between 1594 and
	1595—and secondly, that Herodotus, in writing the parallel story
	of Astyages and Harpagus (1.119), appears to have had our passage
	in mind (note especially his phrase ἄκρων χειρῶν τε καὶ ποδῶν), so it is likely that here, as in Herodotus, mention was
	made of the children’s heads, the display of which to their father
	would be the most unmistakable demonstration of what he had
	been tricked into doing. In the lacuna I translate Rose’s tentative
	supplement, which gives approximately the sense required. That
	the diners were sitting “each by himself” is mentioned to explain
	how it was possible for the children’s flesh to be served to Thyestes
	alone.
	[c dimgray][sup]332[/sup][/c]This does not give the wording of Thyestes’ curse (that is
	given in 1602) but is Aegisthus’ comment on it: as the new heads of
	the royal house, he and Clytaemestra officially take the (of course
	hypocritical) view that the curse and its consequences, including
	the death of Agamemnon, however gratifying to themselves, have
	been disastrous to the interests of the family as a whole (cf. 1570–
	6, 1655–6, 1659–60, [c dimgray]Cho[/c]. 841–3).

	[c dimgray][sup]334[/sup][/c] this piteous murder? I

	learn, old as you are, that education is tough for someone
	of your age who’s been ordered to behave himself. Even in
	old age, imprisonment and the pangs of hunger are most
	excellent medicine-men
	[c dimgray][sup]336[/sup][/c] to instruct the mind. You have

	could also mean “every ill-counselled device”.
	[c dimgray][sup]334[/sup][/c]Here, and again at 1627 and 1634–5, the chorus distinguish
	between Aegisthus who “planned” the murder and Clytaemestra
	who actually performed it. In Athenian law, when a
	wilful homicide had been committed, its planner was as guilty of
	murder as its perpetrator (cf. 1613 “you intentionally killed this man”) and was liable to the same penalty (cf. Andocides 1.94); see
	E. M. Harris in E. Cantarella and G. Thür ed. [c dimgray]Symposion 1997[/c]

	know it well, flung by the people, in justice”. In view of Aegisthus’
	armed guard, they cannot now seriously suppose (contrast 1430)
	that the people will be able to put him or Clytaemestra to death,
	by stoning or otherwise; they can stone him, as it were, only with
	words—but this they are willing to do, at whatever risk, just as at
	1652 they are ready to fight with walking-sticks against swords.

	Aegisthus’ bodyguard ([c dimgray]Cho.[/c] 768), and the members of the chorus, who even ten years ago were too old for military service, certainly
	do not wear swords (ξίφος 1651). Thus 1650 must be spoken by
	Aegisthus; and since it is pointless for him to give two successive

	is that he first gives an inexplicit but easily understood order
	to the captain who then gives a precise, drill-like instruction to his

	[c dimgray][sup]345[/sup][/c] Go now, honourable elders, to your homes,
	<yielding to fate> before you suffer. These things must <be
	Accepted> as we have done them.
	[c dimgray][sup]346[/sup][/c] If, I tell you, a cure for
	these troubles were to appear, we would accept it, after
	having been so wretchedly struck by the heavy talon of the
	evil spirit. Such are the words of a woman, if anyone sees fit
	to learn from them.

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]343[/sup][/c]lit. “you say ‘to die’ to those who accept it”.
	[c dimgray][sup]344[/sup][/c]The [c dimgray]ekkyklēma[/c] was probably withdrawn during the confrontation
	between Aegisthus and the chorus (Clytaemestra having
	stepped off it, then or earlier); note that there are no more
	references to Agamemnon as “this man”, such as had occurred
	regularly until 1644, suggesting that his corpse is no longer visible.
	[c dimgray][sup]345[/sup][/c]Of course they have blood on their hands already; but
	Clytaemestra does not regard the killing of Agamemnon as a
	crime (cf. 1405–6), whereas, even in her view, the massacre of the
	Elders [c dimgray]would[/c] be.
	[c dimgray][sup]346[/sup][/c]The emendations of Madvig and Hermann, which I translate
	here, are far from certain; the transmitted reading ἔρξαντες,
	giving the sense “before you suffer for what you have done”, has
	the ring of authenticity (cf. 1564) but makes it even harder to
	restore the rest of the text.
	[c dimgray][sup]347[/sup][/c]I translate Blomfield’s conjecture, but only as a stopgap;
	the transmitted text gives the absurd meaning “pluck like a flower”.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]On the reconstruction of this part of the prologue, see M. L.
	West, [c dimgray]Liverpool Classical Monthly[/c] 10 (1985) 130–1, and M.
	Griffith, [c dimgray]AJP[/c] 108 (1987) 377–382.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]Either the power which Agamemnon’s angry spirit can exercise
	from the underworld over events on earth, or the royal power
	which his son hopes to regain, or (very likely) both. “Aeschylus” in
	[c dimgray]Frogs[/c] 1144–6 explains the phrase as referring not to Orestes’ fa- ther but to Hermes’ own father (Zeus), but this interpretation may
	be merely meant to provide a feed for a joke by Dionysus (1147–9).
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Here Orestes, like Electra in 124–8, may have asked Hermes,
	in his role as communicator between the upper and nether
	worlds, to bid the gods below respond favourably to his prayers.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]The river(-god) of Argos (cf. [c dimgray]Supp[/c]. 497, [c dimgray]Prom[/c]. 590, 663,
	705). Similarly Achilles was growing a lock of his hair with the intention
	of cutting it on his return home and offering it to his local
	river(-god) Spercheius ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 23.140–9); knowing he will never return
	home, he presents it instead to his dead comrade Patroclus.
	The dedication of hair to a river as a nurture-offering survived as a
	regular ritual at Phigaleia in Arcadia (Pausanias 8.41.3). For the
	cutting of hair in mourning ritual cf. [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 4.197–8, 24.45–46
	(both passages couple it with the shedding of tears) and Plato,

	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]<span class="stage italic">A procession of serving-women (the chorus) begins to
	emerge from the palace door.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] They are elderly, and are
	dressed all in black; there are rents in their clothes and
	gashes on their cheeks. Two of them carry jars on their

	women be that comes here, so striking in their black garments?
	What event shall I guess that it betokens? Has

	for my father to propitiate the powers below?
	\[[c dimgray]

	see my sister Electra coming with them, striking in her bitter
	grief. Zeus, grant that I may avenge the death of my father,
	and may it be your will to be my ally! Pylades, let us
	stand out of the way, so that I can learn for sure what this

	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]This gesture of mourning (mentioned also by Euripides,
	[c dimgray]Alcestis[/c] 768 and [c dimgray]Suppliants[/c] 772) is shown in many artistic images;
	see. J. H. Oakley, [c dimgray]Picturing Death in Classical Athens[/c] (Cambridge,
	2004) 76–77 (“valediction”).
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]It is possible that there followed here a passage, now lost, in which Orestes prayed for the assistance of his father’s spirit in his
	task of taking revenge (cf. 128–148, 456–460, 479–509); but it is
	also possible that the appearance of the women’s procession interrupted
	him before he could do so.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]That the chorus in this play enter from the [c dimgray]skēnē[/c], rather than
	by a side-passage as usual, is well argued by S. Scullion, [c dimgray]Three

	[c darkmagenta][b]chorus[/b][/c]

	I have come from the house, having been sent
	to escort the drink-offerings with rapid beating of

	hands;
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c]
	my cheek stands out red with gashes,
	with furrows freshly cut by my nails
	(though all my life my heart
	has fed on cries of woe);
	the tearing sound of garments rent in grief
	has ruined their linen weave
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]—
	the folds of my robes over my breast, savaged
	by mirthless disaster.
	A clear prophetic dream, breathing out wrath in sleep,
	which made the house’s hair stand on end,
	raised a loud cry of terror at dead of night in the
	innermost part of the house,
	making a heavy attack
	on the women’s quarters;
	and the interpreters of this dream
	proclaimed, under a divine guarantee,
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]
	that those beneath the earth were furiously aggrieved
	and wrathful against the killers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c]On head or breast or both, as a gesture of mourning (like the
	gashing of cheeks and rending of garments mentioned below).
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]lit. “linen-ruining tearings of woven garments have resounded
	due to grief”.
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]i.e. under oath (to give an honest interpretation).

	Such is the graceless favour
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] to avert trouble—
	O Mother Earth!
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]—that she is seeking to do by sending
	me,
	that godless woman. This is a word
	that I am afraid to utter:
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]
	what expiation is there when blood has been shed on the
	ground?
	O hearth full of woe!
	O ruin of the house!
	Sunless darkness, abhorred by all,
	shrouds the house
	because its rulers have perished.
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c]
	The reverence—once unconquerable, invincible,
	impregnable—
	that penetrated the ears and hearts of the people
	is now departing; someone
	is afraid.
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] Good fortune,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]The “favour” that Clytaemestra is ostensibly bestowing on
	the spirit of Agamemnon is “graceless” because her sole motive is
	not to benefit him but to protect herself.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]Earth, as the oldest and greatest of chthonic powers, is
	likely to be offended by the abuse of chthonic rites to which the
	chorus are being forced to be party.
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]The view taken here is that this refers to the next sentence:
	if it is true that bloodshed can never be expiated, then the chorus
	are risking divine wrath and punishment by performing a ritual whose purpose is to expiate it. Others take the reference to be to
	the prayers that will accompany the ritual, or to the words “godless
	woman” (in the latter case the sentence “This is a word that I
	am afraid to utter” would be parenthetical).
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c]The reference is primarily to the death of Agamemnon, but
	(i) this was a sequel to other deaths in the family (cf. 1065–72) and
	(ii) it was the end (unless Orestes were eventually to return) of the
	legitimate royal house of Argos.
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c]It is not clear (and it is not clear whether the poet meant it to
	be clear) whether this is a guarded way of saying that the usurping
	rulers are afraid of the people, or whether it means that the people
	are now in terror of (instead of revering) their rulers (in which
	case the translation would be “men are afraid”). For a similar
	ambiguity cf. [c dimgray]Eum[/c]. 690–2.

	that is a god, and more than a god, among mortals;
	but Justice with her scales watches over them,
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c]
	against some acting swiftly in the daylight,
	while other things wait, to burgeon after long delay
	in the no-man’s-land between light and darkness,
	and others again are held in pitch-black night.
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c]
	Blood when it is drunk up by the nurturing earth
	congeals as vengeful gore that cannot dissolve away:
	the guilty one is torn apart
	by unending calamity
	and sickness that lasts and lasts.
	For him who violates the bower of maidenhood

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c]On the first of the two interpretations given in the previous
	note, the point being made is: our rulers “worship” Fortune,
	thinking that if their luck holds they will be safe, and shut their
	eyes to the certainty that Justice will sooner or later catch up with
	them.
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c]The general point is evidently “justice is sometimes slow
	but always sure”; the most obvious (but far from certain) interpretation
	of the details, taking light and darkness as representing life
	and death, is that some are punished quickly, some late in life,
	some only after death (cf. [c dimgray]Eum[/c]. 175–8, 267–275, 339–340, [c dimgray]Seven[/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]I translate my very
	tentative supplement (replacing the intrusive gloss καθαίροντες) purely for the sake of continuity. A reference to water would certainly
	help to ease the difficulty noted by K. Sier, [c dimgray]Die lyrischen
	Partien der Choephoren des Aischylos[/c] (Stuttgart, 1988) 44, that
	πόρος is not normally used to mean “stream” unless words in the
	context make it clear that this is its sense.
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]i.e. caused it to be besieged and captured by an enemy
	army (presumably Argive or Argive-led). It is left vague when and
	where this occurred; it cannot have been in the recent Trojan War,
	since the women are old (171) and yet were taken “from \[their\]
	father\[s’\] house\[s\]”, i.e. while still unmarried.
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c]The scholia quote a proverb, “Slave, obey your masters in
	right things and in wrong”. In Sophocles’ [c dimgray]Antigone[/c] (666–7) Creon
	misapplies this maxim to claim that the [c dimgray]citizen[/c] owes an absolute
	duty of obedience to state authority.
	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c]i.e. covering my face (both as a mourning gesture and to
	conceal the tears).

	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c]“This refers to an Athenian custom: when they purified a

	crossroads and withdrew without looking back” (scholia).
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c]Not so much because it would anger Clytaemestra in the

	[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c]This incidentally tells us that we are to assume that Electra
	is Agamemnon’s only surviving daughter; her sister Chrysothemis,
	who appears in at least one earlier vase-painting showing the
	death of Aegisthus (see Prag 15–16) and possibly in several others,
	perhaps reflecting a sixth-century poetic account (by Simonides? see J. R. March, [c dimgray]The Creative Poet[/c] \[London, 1987\] 92–95), will
	not be part of Aeschylus’ version of the story. Sophocles brought
	her back into it—and made [c dimgray]her[/c] find the lock at the tomb, and say
	to Electra, “To whom does it belong, except for [c dimgray]you and me[/c]?”
	([c dimgray]Electra[/c] 909).

	[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c]Two sensitive interpretations of this seemingly odd phrase

	they are falling from eyes that have long been dry (cf. [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 887–

	has been transferred from the eyes to the tears. Both ideas

	impious spirit towards her children that belies the name

	this adornment comes from the person I most love in the

	a mind and a voice like a messenger, so that I wouldn’t be
	tossed about in two minds, but would know for sure that I
	should reject this lock, if it really was cut from the head of
	an enemy, or else, if it was my kin, it would be able to join in
	my mourning, giving glory to this tomb and honour to my
	father! \[[c dimgray]Stretching out her arms to heaven[/c]\] We appeal to

	of proportion, not of absolute dimensions—a point, deliberately
	ignored by Euripides ([c dimgray]Electra[/c] 535–7) in his reworking of the recognition,

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]43[/sup][/c]The text is in detail uncertain, but there can be little doubt
	that Aeschylus wrote προσεννέπω “address”, not προυννέπω
	“proclaim”; Electra knows that Argos is a dangerous place for
	Orestes to be (cf. 179–180), and the last thing she would want to
	do is proclaim publicly his presence there.
	[c dimgray][sup]44[/sup][/c]For the business with the hat, Garvie well adduces a slightly
	later Melian relief in Berlin (TI 6803; see Prag 53–54 and pl. 35b)
	in which Orestes’ hat is thus placed while Pylades still has his on
	his head.
	[c dimgray][sup]45[/sup][/c]Evidently a garment, or part of a garment, that Orestes
	is wearing. In Euripides ([c dimgray]Electra[/c] 538–544) Orestes’ old servant
	speaks in terms appropriate to a whole garment, and Electra
	points out that this is absurd, since such a garment, made when
	Orestes was an infant, would be far too small for him to wear as an
	adult; but Aeschylus’ language is at least as consistent with the

	[c dimgray][sup]49[/sup][/c] I must needs address

	<For you have come back to save me, and surely,>
	[c dimgray][sup]50[/sup][/c]

	are hard pressed by ravenous hunger, for they are not

	in banishment from their home.
	[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c] And if you allow us nestlings
	to perish, whose father was the great sacrificer who
	greatly glorified you, from whence will you get the honour
	of a fine feast given with comparable generosity? If you

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]53[/sup][/c]Clytaemestra was compared to a serpent in [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 1233. Vipers
	do not in fact kill their prey by coiling round them; but it was believed
	that “when they copulate . . . the female seizes the male by
	the neck, holds him tight and does not let him go until she has bitten
	it through. . . . But . . . the young, when they are still in their
	mother’s womb, take revenge for their father by eating through
	her belly . . . and emerge from her body in that way” (Herodotus 3.109). The relevance of this to Agamemnon, his wife and his children
	will be evident even before we learn that Clytaemestra in her
	dream had given birth to a snake, with which Orestes identifies
	himself (527–533, 542–550).
	[c dimgray][sup]54[/sup][/c]The speech proceeds as though the metaphorical self-description
	in 247–251 had been a literal description of the plight
	of a pair of young eagles.
	[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c]Electra has not literally been banished, but she has been
	treated in a manner unbefitting a member of the family and has
	described both herself and Orestes as “virtual vagrants” (132).
	[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c]This is ambiguous, perhaps designedly, between a literal interpretation
	(“if there are no eagles there can be no omens”—so
	that Zeus will be damaging his own interests, just as he will if he
	destroys the house of Agamemnon) and a metaphorical one (“if
	you destroy the children of the ‘eagle’ Agamemnon \[who as a king
	was under your special protection, cf. [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 43–44\] you will forfeit
	all credibility in human eyes”).

	[c dimgray][sup]57[/sup][/c]It is doubtless significant that the chorus are afraid only of

	children (even in hope of a reward).
	[c dimgray][sup]58[/sup][/c]This does not refer to a funeral pyre (mention of which

	of being coated with pitch and burnt alive (Aesch. fr. 118;

	[c dimgray][sup]63[/sup][/c]Line 285 (“seeing clearly, moving his/her/their eyebrows in the dark”) can hardly belong here; a detailed description of, say, a
	nightmare vision would break the connection between the statement
	of the Furies’ various torments in 286–290—of which nightmares
	(288) are only one—and the “headline” sentence 283–4 of

	Harpocration φ5; W. Burkert, [c dimgray]Greek Religion[/c] tr. J. Raffan \[Oxford,

	[c dimgray][sup]66[/sup][/c]This exclusion from the sharing of rituals and of roofs, with
	which Orestes is threatened if he does not carry out the revenge
	killings, was precisely the fate that was deemed appropriate,
	throughout the Greek world, for those who [c dimgray]had[/c] committed homicide
	or been complicit in it (cf. [c dimgray]Eum[/c]. 655–6; Sophocles, [c dimgray]Oedipus the King[/c] 236–241; Demosthenes 20.158).
	[c dimgray][sup]67[/sup][/c]This refers primarily to wasting of the still living body (cf.
	Sophron fr. 54 K-A; also Demosthenes 25.61, of the effect of long

	[c dimgray][sup]68[/sup][/c]Some such supplement is necessary; 302–4 cannot (as

	Father who suffered so terribly, what

	Light is the opposite of darkness, and similarly

	Clytaemestra, who actually struck the “bloody strokes”, but they
	do not make the payer’s identity (or even gender) explicit.
	[c dimgray][sup]71[/sup][/c]So Sier understands ὁμοίως (rather than “all the same,
	nevertheless”, which most recent editors favour). The fact that
	lamentation, which the living find displeasing and ill-omened, is
	gratifying to the dead is in harmony, not in contrast, with the fact
	that light and darkness are opposites.
	[c dimgray][sup]72[/sup][/c]The inevitable tension between thinking of the dead as
	dwelling in their tombs, and thinking of them as dwelling in the
	remote realm of Hades, surfaces here as the near-contradiction
	between this line and 317–8 (“from afar to where your resting-place
	confines you”).

	[c dimgray][sup]79[/sup][/c]This can hardly mean “slain in battle at Troy”, since that

	would hardly wish, even hypothetically, for what would have been
	a glorious death for Aegisthus; rather, in the light of the following
	πρόσω, it will be taken to mean more generally “far from home”.
	[c dimgray][sup]80[/sup][/c]As the last words of the sentence show, Electra is referring
	to those who have in actuality experienced “these present troubles”—herself,
	Agamemnon’s family, and perhaps the Argives
	generally.
	[c dimgray][sup]81[/sup][/c]Cf. Pindar, [c dimgray]Pythian[/c] 10.29–44 (no mortal but Perseus has ever reached the land of the Hyperboreans; Apollo delights in
	their feasts, which abound in music and dance, and they are free of
	disease and old age, of toil and warfare).
	[c dimgray][sup]82[/sup][/c]lit. “because you [c dimgray]can[/c] (sc. talk)”.
	[c dimgray][sup]83[/sup][/c]We are less likely to think here of the old men of the chorus
	in [c dimgray]Agamemnon[/c] (as West,[c dimgray] Studies[/c] 243 n.16 does) than (after 355–6
	and 365) of those who fought with Agamemnon at Troy, virtually
	all of whom (in Aeschylus’ version) perished either in the war or
	on the voyage home ([c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 636–680); so apparently the scholia (“our
	allies, those around Agamemnon”). The expression will simultaneously
	remind us of the avengers’ other allies beneath the earth,
	the chthonic gods and the spirit of Agamemnon; but they can look
	for no armed assistance from any mortal [c dimgray]on[/c] the earth.
	[c dimgray][sup]84[/sup][/c]I translate West’s [c dimgray]exempli gratia[/c] supplement; something
	powerful is certainly needed to have the effect on Orestes that he
	describes in 380–1.

	That pierced straight through
	my ear, like an arrow.
	Zeus, Zeus,
	[c dimgray][sup]85[/sup][/c] who sends up from below
	avenging ruin, soon or late,
	against audacious, reckless
	human violence! For my parents, both alike, there will
	be payment!
	[c dimgray][sup]86[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]chorus[/b][/c]

	May it be my lot to raise a massed
	[c dimgray][sup]87[/sup][/c] cry
	of triumph over a man
	struck down and a woman
	perishing; for why should I conceal
	what kind of thought is hovering
	within my mind? Ahead of the prow
	of my heart there blows a harsh wind
	of anger, of raging hatred.

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]85[/sup][/c]Presumably addressing “the Zeus of the underworld”, i.e.
	Hades (see on [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 1386–7).
	[c dimgray][sup]86[/sup][/c]τοκεῦσι could equally well be dative of the recipient (“to my
	parents”) or of the agent (“by my parents”); in fact, of course, the
	payment will be made by one parent to the other.
	[c dimgray][sup]87[/sup][/c]This, or something like it, must be the meaning of πυκάεντ´
	(derived from the adverb πύκα “densely”), if this barely attested
	word, conjectured here by Dindorf, did indeed exist. The transmitted
	reading, πευκήεντ´, gives good sense (“piercing”) but
	raises serious metrical problems here and in the antistrophe
	(410).
	[c dimgray][sup]88[/sup][/c]The image of a mental “headwind” suggests that they feel
	irresistibly driven, in spite of any possible softer inclinations, to
	long eagerly for the violent death of Aegisthus and Clytaemestra,
	even though they are by now aware, from Orestes’ report of
	Apollo’s oracle, that this must involve matricide. Similarly Agamemnon
	is described as “blowing with [c dimgray]the blast of fortune that
	struck him[/c]” ([c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 186) when he changed course ([c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 219) and zealously
	sacrificed his daughter.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]96[/sup][/c]As if to tear out hair; cf. [c dimgray]Pers.[/c] 1056; Sophocles, [c dimgray]Ajax[/c] 310,

	[c dimgray][sup]98[/sup][/c]I have accepted the transposition of strophe and antistrophe:
	Orestes’ reaction in 434–8 is too strong to be plausibly
	provoked merely by the statement—which can hardly come as a
	surprise to him—that there was no public mourning when Agamemnon
	was buried, and τὸ πᾶν ἀτίμως ἔλεξας (434) suggests
	that he has been told more than that.
	[c dimgray][sup]99[/sup][/c]By cutting off his extremities (hands and feet, sometimes

	around his neck and under his armpits (μασχάλαι) with a view,

	Sophocles, [c dimgray]Electra[/c] 445; Sophocles fr. 528, 623 (probably Troilus
	mutilated by Achilles); Apollonius Rhodius 4.477 (Medea’s brother

	[c dimgray][sup]103[/sup][/c]When a wound became, or was expected to become, septic,
	it was the practice to insert a plug of lint (μοτός)—a “tent”, in the parlance of early modern surgeons—so as to keep the wound open
	and allow it to heal naturally by suppuration. See “Hippocrates”,
	[c dimgray]On Wounds in the Head[/c] 14 and [c dimgray]Diseases[/c] 2.47.
	[c dimgray][sup]104[/sup][/c]I have translated Wecklein’s restoration of the badly corrupt
	text; a wish for marriage, which Electra has been disgracefully
	denied for many years (cf. on 135), seems highly likely in view
	of 487.
	[c dimgray][sup]105[/sup][/c]i.e. if (but only if) you grant our prayers: only by the restoration
	of Orestes can Agamemnon hope to receive normal, regular

	[c dimgray][sup]111[/sup][/c]A metaphor from wrestling.
	[c dimgray][sup]112[/sup][/c]This sententious passage is inappropriate in a scene of
	short, impassioned appeals, and spoils both the symmetry
	between the two speakers and (by explaining what needs no explanation)
	the impact of the bold paradox of 504. It is quoted by Clem- ent of Alexandria (see textual note) in a curiously different form,
	the first sentence being given as παῖδες δὲ ἀνδρὶ κατθανόντι
	(κατ᾿ αἶαν ὄντι cod., corr. Dobree) κληδόνες γεγάασι, and he attributes
	the passage to Sophocles (an ascription which all recent
	editors of Sophoclean fragments have by implication rejected).
	Since γεγάασι (an epic form not otherwise found in tragedy at all)
	could not stand in spoken iambics yet can hardly be accounted for
	as a corruption, the most likely explanation of the presence of the
	lines in our text, as Garvie suggests, is that they were originally a
	lyric passage written as an illustrative parallel in the margin, later
	copied into the text and then adapted into iambic verses.

	[c dimgray][sup]119[/sup][/c] Suppose that none of the

	[c dimgray][sup]120[/sup][/c] and say, “Why, pray, does Aegisthus shut his

	the audience to [c dimgray]imagine[/c] that he is speaking Phocian. Much of

	[c dimgray][sup]120[/sup][/c]i.e. travellers from abroad hoping to be given hospitality
	(and perhaps also protection from enemies, whence ἱκέτην “suppliant”
	in 569); the idea is that Aegisthus will eventually be forced
	to admit them for fear of getting a bad name.
	[c dimgray][sup]121[/sup][/c]i.e. grants me an audience (as is presently explained, he

	Thyestes (cf. 1065–76 and [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 1090–1129, 1186–1241).
	[c dimgray][sup]124[/sup][/c]That the power to whom Orestes here entrusts his fortunes
	is Hermes was convincingly argued by A. F. Garvie, [c dimgray]BICS[/c] 17
	(1970) 85–86. Hermes is the god of contests (ἐναγώνιος: cf.
	Aesch. fr. 384; Pindar, [c dimgray]Pythian[/c] 2.10; Aristophanes, [c dimgray]Wealth[/c] 1161–2),
	and he is appealed to at 727–9 in a close echo of the present
	passage. Others have taken the power addressed here to be Apollo
	or the spirit of Agamemnon.

	Scylla is in love with Minos; here, in the absence of any pre-Aeschylean

	Among crimes, that of Lemnos
	[c dimgray][sup]131[/sup][/c] takes first place

	(e.g. \[Apollodorus\], [c dimgray]Library[/c] 3.15.8; Pausanias 2.34.7) was
	drowned by Minos as punishment for her treachery and parricide.
	[c dimgray][sup]131[/sup][/c]The women of Lemnos, led by Hypsipyle, murdered their

	took them as lovers.
	[c dimgray][sup]132[/sup][/c]The people of Lemnos, that is, doubtless during the great
	Lemnian fire-festival which was said to commemorate, and atone

	[c dimgray][sup]133[/sup][/c]“It has become customary throughout Greece for all evil
	deeds to be called ‘Lemnian’” (Herodotus 6.138.4).
	[c dimgray][sup]134[/sup][/c]This may refer to the expulsion from Lemnos of the grandchildren
	of the Lemnian women and the Argonauts (Herodotus
	4.145.2).
	[c dimgray][sup]135[/sup][/c]A verb (either first-person or infinitive) of approximately

	to tell his parents that Orestes is dead; don’t forget on

	in his family is to bring him home, or whether it is to

	[c dimgray][sup]148[/sup][/c]This sentence is probably to be taken as having two meanings.
	Clytaemestra will understand the “task” as the job of bringing
	the message, “friends” as a generalizing plural referring to
	Strophius, and “having agreed to” as referring to a promise made
	to Strophius; for Orestes and the audience, the “task” is his revenge,
	his “friends” are his family and especially his father, and

	[c dimgray][sup]151[/sup][/c]This phrase may (or may not) have found its way into the

	[c dimgray][sup]152[/sup][/c]This name indicates that the nurse is a

	[c dimgray][sup]153[/sup][/c]Someone going on a journey who did not have a suitable

	that man’s heart when he learns of the story. O wretched
	me! For I found the old griefs that have happened in this
	house of Atreus hard enough to bear, all mixed together as
	they were, and they pained my heart within my breast; but
	I have never yet had to endure a sorrow like this. Under the
	other troubles I patiently bore up. But dear Orestes, who
	wore away my life with toil, whom I reared after receiving
	him straight from his mother’s womb! <Over and over
	again I heard> his shrill, imperative cries, which forced me
	to wander around at night <and perform> many disagreeable
	tasks which I had to endure and which did me no
	good.
	[c dimgray][sup]154[/sup][/c] A child without intelligence must needs be reared
	like an animal—how could it be otherwise?—by the intelligence
	of his nurse; when he’s still an infant in swaddling
	clothes he can’t speak at all if he’s in the grip of hunger or
	thirst, say, or of an urge to make water—and the immature
	bowel of small children is its own master. I had to divine
	these things in advance, and often, I fancy, I was mistaken,
	and as cleaner of the baby’s wrappings—well, a launderer
	and a caterer were holding the same post. Practising both

	Bring <back our master, and>

	remove the blood of long-past deeds

	may the ancient murder breed no more in the house.

	[c dimgray][sup]162[/sup][/c] let the man’s house raise its head in happiness,
	and let it, with friendly eyes,
	behold in him the brilliant light

	And may the son of Maia
	[c dimgray][sup]163[/sup][/c] aid him,
	as by rights he should; for he is the best of sternwinds

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]161[/sup][/c]The supplementation of the text, and even the meaning of
	ἄγετε, are quite uncertain; Sier, for example, proposes ἄγετε, <τῶν μέλεσθ᾿ ἐναργῶς> (“come, make manifest your concern
	with it \[the house\]”.
	[c dimgray][sup]162[/sup][/c]This god is almost certainly Apollo, and the “portal” (literally
	“mouth”) is usually identified with some feature of the sanctuary
	of Delphi; but the word στόμιον is not used elsewhere in connection
	with Delphi, the gods addressed before and after this
	stanza are closely connected with the palace (for Hermes cf. 1,
	583), and the house is strongly in the chorus’s mind throughout
	this ode (786, 790, 798, 800–1, 806, 808, 820, 835). Sier is therefore
	probably right to suppose that the chorus are addressing
	Apollo Agyieus (cf. [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 1081) and that the “portal” is that of the
	palace.
	[c dimgray][sup]163[/sup][/c]Hermes.
	[c dimgray][sup]164[/sup][/c]For example in his roles as the guide of travellers (Hermes
	Hegemonios; cf. e.g. Theocritus 25.4–6) and the patron of interpreters
	(ἑρμηνεῖς); but this aspect of Hermes is mentioned here
	only as a foil to set off by contrast the aspect of him in which the
	chorus are really interested, his powers of deception.

	[c dimgray][sup]177[/sup][/c]It is not clear whether this refers (i) to a sworn pledge by
	Apollo to protect Orestes if he carries out the revenge (cf. 269–270,
	1029–33), or (ii) to a sworn undertaking by Orestes to do so,
	or (iii) to mutual oaths of fidelity between Orestes and Pylades (so
	the scholia; cf. 977–9 where this phrase is echoed by ὅρκος . . .

	(986); but Orestes’ original intention, before he realized he might

	[c dimgray]tout court[/c], and the only god who can be spoken of as πατήρ [c dimgray]tout

	somewhat off the track; my mind is almost out of
	control and carrying me along half-overpowered, and Terror
	is near my heart, ready to sing and to dance to Wrath’s
	tune
	[c dimgray][sup]203[/sup][/c]—but while I still have my wits, I make proclamation
	to my friends and say that it was not without justice
	that I killed my mother, the polluted murderer of my
	father, hated by the gods. And as my prime inducement to
	dare this deed I name Loxias, the prophet god of Pytho,
	whose oracle told me that if I did it I would be free from
	guilt and blame, but if I failed to—I shall not speak of the
	punishment: no archer could reach that height of suffering.
	[c dimgray][sup]204[/sup][/c]
	And now see me, how, accoutred with this wreathed
	olive-branch, I will go as a suppliant to Loxias’ domain, his
	abode at the central navel of earth,
	[c dimgray][sup]205[/sup][/c] and to the light of
	the fire that is called immortal,
	[c dimgray][sup]206[/sup][/c] fleeing this kindred
	bloodshed: to no other hearth than that did Loxias bid me
	direct myself. I call on all Argives <to preserve in memory>
	for me, as time goes by, how these evils were brought to
	pass, and to bear witness for me <if> Menelaus <comes

	[c dimgray][sup]203[/sup][/c]The wrath in question is that of Clytaemestra’s spirit

	[c dimgray][sup]204[/sup][/c]This metaphor is chosen because an arrow shot from a bow

	[c dimgray][sup]207[/sup][/c]M has here lost parts of two successive lines; restorations

	[c dimgray]Electra[/c] 1278–81 and [c dimgray]Orestes[/c] 52–56) Menelaus is said to have arrived
	home very shortly after the death of Clytaemestra and Aegisthus. Presumably in the lost satyr-drama [c dimgray]Proteus[/c] the seer
	Proteus will have given Menelaus predictions and instructions
	about his return (cf. [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 4.543–7), but we do not know how
	precise these were—and those watching the first performance of
	[c dimgray]Libation-Bearers[/c] will not have known this either.
	[c dimgray][sup]208[/sup][/c]This line almost exactly repeats [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 1282, which referred to
	Orestes’ time in exile [c dimgray]before[/c] he returned to take his revenge.
	[c dimgray][sup]209[/sup][/c]I translate my tentative restoration, which cannot be very
	far from the sense of the lost line: the plural τάσδε κληδόνας
	makes it likely that Orestes mentioned [c dimgray]two[/c] features of the reputation
	he would leave behind him, and the chorus’s response makes
	it likely that he laid the stress on the feature that weighed against
	him.

	fathered by Hephaestus (Euripides fr. 925; schol. [c dimgray]Iliad[/c]
	2.547). The road they made was that “by which the Athenians
	now send their sacred embassy to the Pythian festival” (Ephorus

	newly-drawn sword and a tall-grown olive branch reverently
	adorned with a very long wreath of wool, of snow-white
	fleece (by speaking this way I shall make myself
	clear). In front of this man there is an extraordinary band
	of women, asleep, sitting on chairs—no, I won’t call them

	[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c]ἔκνομος occurs only once elsewhere in tragedy ([c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 1473,
	where it means “tuneless”); here it appears to mean “someone
	who is away from home” (contrast ἔννομος “inhabitant”, [c dimgray]Supp.[/c]
	565).
	[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c]lit. “<who is> sped on his way to mortals with the fortune of a
	good escort”.
	[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c]It is quite uncertain how the ghost’s appearance was staged.
	To have the actor emerge from “underground”, via a trapdoor or
	subterranean passage, is unlikely to have been practicable; even
	more than three decades later, the ghost of Polydorus in Euripides’
	[c dimgray]Hecuba[/c] appears [c dimgray]above[/c] the level of the main performing
	area (cf. [c dimgray]Hecuba[/c] 30–31). An entrance from the [c dimgray]skēnē[/c], into which
	Apollo has just withdrawn to re-emerge at 179, might be confusing.
	It may thus be best to suppose that the actor simply entered
	by a side-passage (presumably the opposite one to that by which
	Orestes has just departed).
	[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c]That she is in dishonour is apparent from the fact that she is
	“wandering disgraced” (98) up on earth, instead of remaining
	below as an accepted member of underworld society.

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c]Here the manuscripts add two extra lines: “For the sleeping
	mind is bright with eyes, whereas in daytime mortals’ destiny is to
	have no prevision.” The second of these lines is worse than irrelevant
	(the Furies are not mortals, are not being invited to see the
	future, and would be able to see Clytaemestra’s wounds just as
	well, if not better, were they awake); and while the first might well
	in itself be acceptable, it makes so neat an antithesis with the second
	that one is almost inevitably driven to conclude that the two
	lines were written to stand together—in which case they were not
	written to stand here.
	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c]These two phrases should be taken as synonymous.
	[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c]Sacrifices to chthonic divinities were made not on a raised
	altar (βωμός) but at a dug-out hearth on the ground (ἐσχάρα).
	[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c]i.e. with none of the [c dimgray]upper-world[/c] gods.
	[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c]Normally περὶ ψυχῆς would mean “for my life, with my life
	at stake”; but, with Clytaemestra already dead, the phrase is ambiguous
	between a metaphorical sense “on a matter of vital concern”
	and a literal, but abnormal, sense “for <the welfare of> my
	soul <in Hades>”.
	[c dimgray][sup]39[/sup][/c]This sound would be represented in Greek letters as μυ μυ
	(cf. Aristophanes, [c dimgray]Knights[/c] 10), hence the stage-direction μυγμός
	in the manuscripts.

	Such are the actions of the younger gods,
	who are exercising total power, beyond what justice
	allows.
	I can see that the prophetic throne
	is dripping with gore from head to foot,
	and that the navel of earth has acquired for its own
	a horrible blood-pollution.
	Seer though he is,[c dimgray][sup]48[/sup][/c] he has polluted and defiled
	the inner sanctum of his own house—himself setting the
	pollution in motion, himself inviting it in—
	violating the laws of the gods by honouring what is
	mortal
	while annulling the ancient dispensations of destiny,[c dimgray][sup]49[/sup][/c]
	[c dimgray]and[/c] giving offence to [c dimgray]me[/c]! And he will not enable that
	man to get free:
	even if he flees beneath the earth, he will never be
	freed,
	but, polluted suppliant that he is, he will be going
	where he will get another avenger[c dimgray][sup]50[/sup][/c] on his head.

	Out, I tell you, get out of this house at once! Get away from
	my inner prophetic sanctum, in case you find yourself on
	the receiving end of a winged flashing snake[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c] speeding
	from my golden bowstring, and vomit out in agony black
	foam taken from human bodies, bringing up the clots of
	blood that you have sucked. It is utterly unfitting that you
	should have the least contact with this house: you belong
	where there are head-chopping, eye-gouging judgements
	and slaughters,[c dimgray][sup]52[/sup][/c] where eunuchs are punished by the destruction
	of their children’s seed,[c dimgray][sup]53[/sup][/c] where there is mutilation
	of extremities[c dimgray][sup]54[/sup][/c] and stoning,[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c] and where men moan
	with long and piteous cries after being impaled under the
	spine.[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c] Do you hear what kind of festivity, detestable to
	the gods, you have a fondness for? The whole nature of
	your appearance indicates as much. Such beings ought
	properly to dwell in the den of some blood-swilling lion,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c]A “kenning”for an arrow, which flies like a bird and bites
	like a snake.
	[c dimgray][sup]52[/sup][/c]Like most of the other atrocities mentioned in the next few
	lines, blinding and beheading were seen as “barbarian”(especially
	Persian) practices (cf. e.g. [c dimgray]Pers.[/c] 369–371; Xenophon, [c dimgray]Anabasis[/c]
	1.9.13), unknown or very rare among Greeks.
	[c dimgray][sup]53[/sup][/c]How deeply most Greeks detested the practice of castration
	(whether punitive or otherwise) is well illustrated by the story of Hermotimus and Panionius (Herodotus 8.104–6). The present
	passage seems to envisage castration being inflicted not only on a
	criminal but also on his sons (as indeed happened to Panionius);
	for the punishment of a criminal’s children, cf. Herodotus 3.119,
	7.39.2–3. The usual construal of this passage, which makes it refer
	to the castration of young boys (not as a punishment, but in order
	to sell them as eunuch slaves), is rightly criticized by M. Hendry,
	[c dimgray]Hermes[/c] 126 (1998) 380–2, though he is not responsible for the interpretation
	offered here.
	[c dimgray][sup]54[/sup][/c]Hands, feet, nose and/or ears;
	cf. Herodotus 3.69.5, 3.118.2, 3.154–5, 9.112.1.
	[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c]Unlike the other practices mentioned, stoning was familiar
	to Greeks (cf. [c dimgray]Ag[/c]. 1615–6), but normally as a method of spontaneous
	lynching rather than of judicial punishment (as in the case of
	Lycides at Athens in 480/79, Herodotus 9.5).
	[c dimgray][sup]56[/sup][/c]For this form of execution, commonly used by the Persians,
	cf. Herodotus 1.128,2, 3.159.1, 4.43.6; \[Euripides,\] [c dimgray]Rhesus[/c] 512–7.

	[c dimgray][sup]63[/sup][/c]This implies that an oath to violate the obligations of marriage
	(such as the mutual oaths of Clytaemestra and Aegisthus, cf.
	[c dimgray]Cho[/c]. 977–9) has, or should have, no binding force; Apollo will
	later say that the same is true of any oath which, if kept, would go

	and for those who see,[c dimgray][sup]83[/sup][/c]
	hear me! The child of Leto[c dimgray][sup]84[/sup][/c]
	is depriving me of my rights
	by snatching away from me
	this hare,[c dimgray][sup]85[/sup][/c] a proper sacrifice
	to cleanse a mother’s murder.
	And over the sacrificial victim
	this is my song: insanity,
	derangement, the mind-destroying
	chant of the Furies
	that binds the mind, sung
	to no lyre,[c dimgray][sup]86[/sup][/c] a song to shrivel men up!
	For this was the lot
	that death-dealing[c dimgray][sup]87[/sup][/c] Destiny
	spun for us in perpetuity:
	for those mortals to whom there happen
	wanton murders of kinsfolk,[c dimgray][sup]88[/sup][/c]
	to dog their footsteps till
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]83[/sup][/c]i.e. for the dead and the living.
	[c dimgray][sup]84[/sup][/c]Apollo.
	[c dimgray][sup]85[/sup][/c]Orestes.
	[c dimgray][sup]86[/sup][/c]i.e. “not joyful”(cf. [c dimgray]Ag.[/c] 990–1).
	[c dimgray][sup]87[/sup][/c]Elsewhere in Aeschylus ([c dimgray]Cho.[/c] 184, 640; [c dimgray]Seven[/c] 895) διανταῖος
	always describes an (antual or metaphorical) sword-thrust
	that goes clean through the body.
	[c dimgray][sup]88[/sup][/c]This refers of course to the perpetrators of such murders,
	not the victims; the expression seems odd, but is highly appropriate
	to Orestes, who through no fault of his own found himself in a
	situation where he had no alternative but to kill his mother. Since
	αὐτουργίαι can be understood to mean “murder of kinsfolk” only
	by the analogy of words like αὐτοφονίαι (its gloss in M) and
	αὐθέντης the phrase αὐτουργίαι . . . probably carries simultaneously
	a second meaning, “acts of wanton wickedness” or
	the like, foreshadowing the broader jurisdiction which will be
	claimed by or for the Furies in later passages (421, 517ff, 930–1,
	950ff).

	From far away I heard a cry summoning me, from the Scamander,
	where I was staking my claim to the land which
	the leaders and chiefs of the Achaeans had apportioned to
	me entirely, absolutely and for ever, a large share of the
	captured property, as a special gift set aside for the children
	of Theseus.[c dimgray][sup]101[/sup][/c] From there I have come on rapid and
	unwearied foot, not flying on wings but flapping the folds
	of my aegis.[c dimgray][sup]102[/sup][/c] Now, seeing these new visitors to my land,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]100[/sup][/c]It is not clear whether Athena enters on foot or by means of
	the [c dimgray]mēchanē;[/c] in either case she will have appeared from the opposite
	direction to that from which Orestes and the Furies arrived.
	[c dimgray][sup]101[/sup][/c]This may refer to the Athenians in general (cf. 13, 1011)
	and/or to the actual sons of Theseus (Acamas and Demophon),
	who in the cyclic epics and in Athenian tradition (though not in
	the [c dimgray]Iliad[/c]) played a prominent part in the Trojan War (cf. [c dimgray]Little Iliad[/c]) fr. 17 West; [c dimgray]Sack of Trog[/c] fr. 6 West; Sophocles, [c dimgray]Philoctetes[/c] 562,
	Euripides, [c dimgray]Hecuba[/c] 123–9, [c dimgray]Iphigeneia at Aulis[/c] 247–252). The land referred to is usually taken to be Sigeum, a fortress near the site
	of Troy, between the Hellespont and the lowest reaches of the
	Scamander, which had once been disputed between Athens and
	Mytilene (Herodotus 5.94–95); in the early fifth century it was a
	Persian possession, but Athenian forces had seen action there in
	465/4 ([c dimgray]The Athenian Agora[/c] xvii 1.32, 119) and by 451/0 Sigeum
	was a member of the Athenian alliance ([c dimgray]IG[/c] i[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] 17).
	[c dimgray][sup]102[/sup][/c]Athena’s aegis is represented in art as a garment (now
	short, now long, and often scaly) fringed with tassels or with
	snakes, either worn over the shoulders or hung over the left arm.
	In the manuscripts there follows a line (“yoking this chariot to
	colts in their prime”) which implies, contrary to 403, that Athena
	entered in a horse-drawn vehicle; this was doubtless written to replace
	404 for a production in which her entrance was staged in
	that way.

	[c dimgray][sup]104[/sup][/c]The Furies are, in effect, challenging Orestes to a contest

	swear that he did not or, if he refuses to do so, lose his case.
	Orestes, of course, could not possibly accept this challenge, and Athena—taking note, no doubt, of how the Furies evaded her
	very pertinent question about what caused Orestes to act as he
	did—perceives that the challenge is a ploy designed to secure
	Orestes’ condemnation on an issue which is not in dispute
	(whether Orestes actually killed his mother) while avoiding the
	issue which [c dimgray]is[/c] in dispute (whether the killing was justified or excusable).

	a suppliant deserving respect, not one after the manner

	understand.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]orestes[/b][/c]
	Lady Athena, I will begin from your last words by removing
	a great anxiety. I am not a suppliant seeking purification,
	and I have not sat down clasping your image with pollution
	on my hand. I will give you powerful proof of this.
	It is the law that a man who has committed homicide
	must not speak until blood has dripped over him from the
	slaughter of a young sucking beast at the hands of a man
	who can cleanse blood-pollution. I have long since been
	purified in this way at other houses,[c dimgray][sup]106[/sup][/c] both by animal victims
	and by flowing streams.[c dimgray][sup]107[/sup][/c] That is what I say to set this
	anxiety aside; now you will quickly learn my origin. I am an
	Argive, and you know my father well—Agamemnon, commander
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]105[/sup][/c]Ixion, who had murdered his father-in-law (treacherously
	and without provocation, in order to avoid paying his just debts),
	supplicated Zeus for purification, was granted it, and proved himself
	utterly unworthy of this divine favour by attempting to seduce
	Hera: see Pindar, [c dimgray]Pythian[/c] 2.21–48 (with scholia) and Diodorus Siculus 4.69.3–5. A suppliant “with trust in justice \[and\] deserving
	respect” would thus certainly not be one “after the manner of
	Ixion” (and hence I have adopted West’s tentative insertion of a
	negative in the text—see [c dimgray]Studies[/c] 280–1); and Orestes evidently
	also detects in Athena’s words some concern as to whether he, like
	Ixion, is still under blood-pollution, as one would [c dimgray]prima facie[/c]
	expect a suppliant homicide to be.
	[c dimgray][sup]106[/sup][/c]The plurals οἴκοισι . . . βοτοῖσι . . . πόροις indicate that
	Orestes is claiming to have been ritually purified not only at Delphi
	but also at one or more (unspecified) other locations. There
	was a local tradition of such a purification at Trozen (Pausanias
	2.31.4) and there may well have been other such traditions elsewhere.
	[c dimgray][sup]107[/sup][/c]Water as well as blood was used in purification rites; see R.
	Parker, [c dimgray]Miasma[/c] (Oxford, 1983) 226–7.

	[c dimgray][sup]112[/sup][/c]This must be addressed to Orestes (cf. 473), not the Furies:
	the possibility that the Furies may remain in Athens is not raised
	by anyone until 711 at least, and perhaps not until 804–7.
	[c dimgray][sup]113[/sup][/c]This is the meaning given by the scholia and required by
	the context; but while ἀμηνίτως can be restored with confidence,
	there is no simple emendation of the unmetrical δυσπήματ᾿ that
	gives the required sense (except Hartung’s δυσπάλαμν᾿—but
	δυσπάλαμνος is nowhere attested, and εὐπάλαμνος not till
	Byzantine times). My tentative emendation is based on an earlier
	suggestion by Thomson (δυσμήχανον πέμπειν τ᾿ ἀμηνίτως ἐμοί).
	Athena will incur the Furies’ wrath if she decides in
	Orestes’ favour, and the wrath of the betrayed suppliant (cf. 233–
	4) if she decides against him.

	Now comes the overthrow of ordained

	of this slayer of his mother
	is going to prevail.
	This event will at once unite
	all mortals in total licentiousness.
	Many very real sufferings,
	wounds inflicted by their children, await parents
	in the future, as time passes.
	For no one will be assailed by wrath arising from such
	deeds,
	not even the wrath of us wild beings
	who watch all that mortals do:
	I will unleash every kind of death upon them.
	Proclaiming loudly the evils that have befallen their

	they will search eagerly far and wide[c dimgray][sup]115[/sup][/c]
	for something to end or abate their troubles,

	I speak a word that fits together with that:
	Outrage is in very truth the child of Impiety,
	but from a healthy mind
	springs prosperity, dear to all
	and much prayed for.
	I say to you, as a universal rule:
	respect the altar of Justice,
	and do not,
	with a view to gain, spurn and trample it with godless
	foot, for punishment will follow:
	the appointed end awaits.
	In view of this, let everyone give proper honour to the
	sanctity of parents
	and be respectful
	of the honour due to guests
	from one who is master of a house.
	In this way he will be righteous without painful
	compulsion,
	will not fail to enjoy prosperity,
	and will never come to utter destruction.
	But he, I say, who audaciously acts contrary to this,

	done so (cf. [c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 8.478–481; Hesiod, [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 715–814).

	[c dimgray][sup]138[/sup][/c]A phratry was a group of families forming a religious guild.

	I will tell you that too—and mark how rightly I argue. The
	so-called “mother” is not a parent of the child, only the
	nurse of the newly-begotten embryo. The parent is he who
	mounts; the female keeps the offspring safe, like a stranger
	on behalf of a stranger, for those in whose case this is not
	prevented by god.[c dimgray][sup]140[/sup][/c] I shall give you powerful proof of this
	statement. A father can procreate without a mother:[c dimgray][sup]141[/sup][/c] a
	witness to this is here close by us \[[c dimgray]indicating Athena[/c]\], the
	daughter of Olympian Zeus, who was not even nurtured in
	the darkness of a womb, but is such an offspring as no female
	divinity could ever bring forth. \[[c dimgray]Addressing Athena[/c]\]
	Pallas, I mean in all respects, to the best of my ability, to
	promote the greatness of your city and your people, and in
	particular I have sent this man to the hearth of your house

	and his posterity, and so that it might everlastingly remain

	[c dimgray][sup]140[/sup][/c]This theory of reproduction is ascribed by Aristotle ([c dimgray]De

	φυσιολόγοι”; we do not know whether Aeschylus himself believed
	it, or whether his audience would have found it convincing.
	[c dimgray][sup]141[/sup][/c]Apollo leaves it to be inferred that a female cannot procreate
	without a father, but (unlike Orestes in Euripides, [c dimgray]Orestes[/c]
	554—if that line is genuine) he does not actually assert this. He
	could not, in mythological terms, have asserted it truthfully;
	Hesiod’s [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] names dozens of divinities as having been
	born parthenogenetically with no father, among them Hephaestus
	(927) and the Keres/Furies themselves (217).

	rescue an Amazon princess whom Theseus had carried off from
	her homeland in an earlier expedition, but there was another tradition
	(cf. Lysias 2.4–6) according to which their invasion was an
	unprovoked act of aggression. There was a sanctuary called the
	Amazoneion on the alleged site of the Amazons’ camp on the
	Areopagus (Diodorus Siculus 4.28.2–3; Cleidemus, [c dimgray]FGrH[/c] 323 F

	[c dimgray][sup]147[/sup][/c]This aetiology for the name of the Areopagus appears to

	[c dimgray][sup]148[/sup][/c]The text could mean that the citizenry will be deterred

	council, or, equally well, that the council will be deterred from

	Sparta (Aeschylus seems to have forgotten that Athens’ new ally
	Argos was also in the Peloponnese). Both Scythians (e.g. \[Aesch.\]
	fr. 198) and Spartans (e.g. Herodotus 1.65–66, Thucydides 1.18.1)

	<And I, wretched that I am, am dishonoured, grievously
	angry,
	releasing poison, poison,

	in this land—ah!—
	a drip falling on the land,
	such that it cannot bear! And from it
	a canker causing leaflessness and childlessness—O
	Justice, Justice!—
	sweeping over the soil
	will fill the land with miasmas fatal to humans.
	I groan. What shall I do?
	I am a laughing-stock. I have suffered

	Ió, great is the calamity that we unhappy daughters

	[c darkmagenta][b]Athena[/b][/c]
	I will be indulgent towards your anger, since you are older
	than I; but while for that reason you are much wiser than I
	am, still Zeus has given me too a fair degree of intelligence.
	If you go to the land of another people, then I foretell
	you will long for this country like lovers.[c dimgray][sup]167[/sup][/c] Time as it
	flows on will bring ever-greater glory to these citizens, and
	you too will have a glorious abode, close to the house of
	Erechtheus,[c dimgray][sup]168[/sup][/c] and will receive from processions of men
	and women[c dimgray][sup]169[/sup][/c] such honours as you would never get from
	any other race of mortals. Do not plant in my country the
	whetstones of bloodshed[c dimgray][sup]170[/sup][/c] which corrupt young men’s

	[c dimgray][sup]168[/sup][/c]i.e. the temple of Athena Polias, in which the hero
	Erechtheus also dwelt ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 2.547–551, [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 7.81).
	[c dimgray][sup]169[/sup][/c]lit. “from men and processions of women”.
	[c dimgray][sup]170[/sup][/c]i.e. influences that sharpen in men’s hearts the spirit of
	wrathful violence. The denunciation of civil war, which begins
	here and continues till 866, appears to be a last-minute addition
	by the poet to an already completed script. It makes this speech of
	Athena’s substantially longer than her three others in this scene,
	and τοιαῦτ᾿ in 867 refers back not to what now directly precedes
	it, but to 854–7; on the other hand the passage cannot be a post-
	Aeschylean interpolation, since there is no post-Aeschylean date
	to which its message, which deplores civil war [c dimgray]but positively encourages
	external war[/c] (864), would be appropriate. See E. R.
	Dodds, [c dimgray]PCPS[/c] 6 (1960) 23–24 = [c dimgray]The Ancient Concept of Progress[/c]

	Such as are appropriate to an honourable victory, coming

	come over the land breathing the air of bright sunshine;

	[c dimgray][sup]174[/sup][/c]i.e. a cultivator who feels the same personal bond to each

	Atreus and Agamemnon were both child-killers, Thyestes and

	are reminiscent of those worn by μέτοικοι (see on 1011) in the
	Panathenaic procession (Photius s.v. σκάφας, citing Menander fr.
	147 K-A); in that case the lost passage might have ended e.g. <ἀλλ᾿
	ὡς μετοίκους τάσδε τὰς σεμνὰς θεὰς>, and line 1027 (“of girls,

	the Areopagus Council, led by the herald and trumpeter (cf. 566–9);
	the Furies, now the Semnai Theai. For the audience, this
	spectacle would probably be reminiscent both of the Panathenaic
	procession (cf. on 1028) and of the great procession in honour of the Semnai Theai themselves (see Introduction), in which the
	members of the Areopagus Council, with which the Semnai Theai
	were so closely associated, surely had a prominent role.
	[c dimgray][sup]199[/sup][/c]“Childless” because under the new dispensation crime will

	[c dimgray][sup]200[/sup][/c]i.e. keep silence. These injunctions at the end of each

	ἐνδαιδες are a mechanical repetition of (σπ)ονδαιδες earlier in

	might be πάνδικον οἶκον “the home that is justly yours” (cf., for

	that Παλλάδος ἀσοῖς may belong to this rather than the

	corrupted verb. In that case the next sentence, beginning with
	Ζεὺς might mean “Thus Zeus the all-seeing and Destiny have descended
	together”, sc. from the Acropolis in the procession—
	Zeus being represented by his daughter Athena (cf. 736–8, 973),
	Destiny by the Erinyes-Semnai, sisters of the Fates (cf. 961–2),
	and the union of the two in a single procession symbolizing the
	restoration of harmony among the gods and, it may be hoped,
	among the Athenian people.

	[b]ΑΘΑΜΑΣ[/b]
	[c dimgray]Athamas, son of Aeolus, was a central figure in several
	myths, mostly concerned with the actions and fate of his
	wives and children. These were the subject of several tragedies,
	including three by Sophocles and three by Euripides.
	We do not know what part of Athamas’ story was dealt
	with in Aeschylus’ play; our only clue is provided by two
	fragments (frr. 1, 2a) which show that there was mention of
	a child (probably one of a pair) being thrown into a cauldron.
	This will refer to one or the other of Athamas’ two
	children by his second wife Ino, Learchus and Melicertes.
	According to pseudo-Apollodorus (3.4.3, cf. 1.9.2) Athamas
	and Ino were driven mad by Hera for having agreed
	to care for the child Dionysus (whose mother Semele was
	Ino’s sister): Athamas shot Learchus with an arrow, under
	the delusion that he was a deer, while Ino threw Melicertes
	into a boiling cauldron and leaped into the sea, taking the
	cauldron with her. In another version, preserved in the ancient
	introduction (Hypothesis) to Pindar’s[/c] Isthmians, [c dimgray]it
	was Learchus, after he had been killed, whom Ino put in
	the cauldron (presumably in the hope of restoring him to
	life—compare the story of Medea and the daughters of[/c]

	[c dimgray]Pelias), and it was only later that she was driven mad and
	leaped into the sea with Melicertes; but this was clearly not
	the version Aeschylus gave, since[/c]τὸν μὲν [c dimgray]in fr. 1 shows that
	the boy who was boiled was mentioned before the one who
	was shot. In any case, the account appears to be a retrospective
	summary rather than a full narrative, and Aeschylus’
	play will therefore have been about something that befell
	Athamas[/c] after [c dimgray]his loss of Ino and her children. The
	story about Athamas that was dramatized most often was
	that of the near-sacrifice of Phrixus, his son by Nephele,
	who eventually escaped with his sister Helle on a golden
	ram (Helle falling off into what became known as the Hellespont,
	Phrixus safely reaching Colchis). This story usually
	begins with a plot against the sons of Nephele by their
	stepmother Ino, but in some accounts (reported by a scholiast
	to Pindar,[/c] Pythian  4.288 \[162\]), the stepmother is
	differently named, and the mythographer Pherecydes (fr.
	98 Fowler), a contemporary of Aeschylus, named her as
	Themisto—who is virtually always Athamas’ last [c dimgray]wife, after
	Nephele and Ino. Possibly therefore Aeschylus’ play
	dealt with the Phrixus story but placed it after (and not,
	like most later accounts, before) the Learchus-Melicertes
	story.[/c]

	[c dimgray]According to the[/c] Life of Aeschylus  (§9), this play was
	produced, during one of Aeschylus’ visits to Sicily, at (or
	at least in honour of) the new city of Aetna, which was
	founded by Hieron of Syracuse in 476/5 bc. Fragments
	of what is probably a hypothesis of the play are preserved
	in Oxyrhynchus Papyrus [c dimgray]2257; they reveal that, most abnormally,
	it had many changes of scene, the setting being
	successively Aetna (perhaps the mountain rather than
	the city), Xuthia (a district near Leontini), Aetna again,
	Leontini, Syracuse, and another unidentifiable locality—al
	of them places within Hieron’s dominions. References
	to the play by Macrobius[/c] (Saturnalia [c dimgray]5.19.16–31[/c]) [c dimgray]and
	Stephanus of Byzantium (496.7–13) suggest strongly,
	though they do not conclusively prove, that the play told
	the story of a Sicilian nymph called Thaleia, daughter of
	Hephaestus (fr. 7), who was made pregnant by Zeus and
	then swallowed up by the earth—some say by command of
	the jealous Hera, others by the act of Zeus to protect her
	from Hera’s wrath. The chorus of women of Aetna (or
	maybe rather of mountain nymphs, sisters of Thaleia?)
	may perhaps have been wandering across Sicily in search
	of her. In due time her twin offspring emerged from[/c]

	Women of Aetna; [c dimgray]these designations are not found
	elsewhere, and it has been suggested that some time after
	the play was produced in Sicily, Aeschylus—or possibly

	[b]ΑΜΥΜΩΝΗ[/b]
	[c dimgray]This was the satyr-drama of the Danaid tetralogy. The
	story behind it is told, with some variations, by several
	later mythographers, notably pseudo-Apollodorus (2.1.4)
	and Hyginus[/c] (Fabulae [c dimgray]169a). Amymone, one of the daughters
	of Danaus, was sent into the Argive countryside to
	fetch water, and there attracted the attention of a satyr (accounts
	differ as to how this happened) who attempted to
	rape her. She called for help to Poseidon, who appeared at
	once, put the satyr to flight, and then himself lay with
	Amymone; afterwards he created for her the spring of
	Lerna by striking the ground with his trident. In the play
	there must of course have been a whole chorus of satyrs,
	and they can have been driven off (if at all) only at the end
	of the drama; a series of vase-paintings from the late fifth
	and early fourth centuries (see for example KPS, pl. 18a,[/c]

	was besieged lustfully by the whole band,

	Amymone. Echoes of the preceding tragic trilogy are evident,
	as Amymone, like her sisters, is placed by her father
	in a dangerous situation, is threatened with and resists
	forcible violation by an arrogant, shameless band of males,
	and is finally joined in an apparently willing union with an

	[b]ΑΡΓΩ ἢ ΚΩΠΑΣΤΑΙ[/b]
	[c dimgray]This play was obviously about the Argonautic expedition,
	but all we can say about it for certain is that mention
	was made of the marvellous beam of the ship which
	had the power of speech (frr. 20, 20a) and of the helmsman
	(T)iphys (fr. 21). Since the latter died before reaching
	Colchis (Apollonius Rhodius 2.851–860), it is a reasonable
	supposition that the play dealt with the early stages of the
	expedition, perhaps even with its very beginning (with
	Iolcus as its scene).[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Since only five known Aeschylean plays had an Argonautic
	connection, one of which[/c] (Phineus) [c dimgray]is known to have
	been produced together with plays on other subjects, it
	is likely that the remaining four[/c]—The Argo, Lemnian
	Women, Hypsipyle [c dimgray]and[/c] Cabeiri—[c dimgray]formed a tetralogy[/c]. The
	Argo [c dimgray]has usually been put down as one of the three tragedies
	in this production, most likely the first. However, it
	then becomes very difficult to account for its alternative
	title.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]This second title is found only in the medieval catalogue
	of plays, where it appears as[/c] Κωπαστής[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] (The Oarsman).
	[c dimgray]This is an impossible title for a tragedy, and the emendation[/c]

	This would also make good sense of the context in
	which Philo quotes fr. 20: he says that the Argo, [c dimgray]“being endowed
	with soul and reason, would not allow slaves to step
	aboard her”. Very possibly the satyrs (who are slaves of Dionysus),
	attracted by the prospect of winning the Golden
	Fleece, volunteered to crew the[/c] Argo [c dimgray]for Jason (perhaps not
	much to his liking) and were prevented from doing so by
	the ship herself (probably the speaking beam complained,

	[c dimgray]This was the second play of the Thracian or Lycurgus

	the satyr-drama[/c] Lycurgus. [c dimgray]It is known from the[/c] Cataterisms
	[c dimgray]of pseudo-Eratosthenes (§24; see West[/c], Studies  33–36)
	that the play dealt with the death of Orpheus at the
	hands of Thracian women, who in this version, unusually,
	are devotees of Dionysus, called Bassarids. “Orpheus,” we
	are told, “after going down to Hades in quest of his wife
	and seeing what things were like there, ceased to honour
	Dionysus, by whom he had been glorified, and regarded
	the Sun (whom he also called Apollo) as the greatest of the
	gods; he would rise before daybreak and await the sunrise
	on the \[Thracian\] mountain called Pangaeum, so as to be
	the first to see the Sun. Dionysus was angry at this and sent
	against him the Bassarids (as the tragic poet Aeschulus
	says), who tore him in pieces and scattered his limbs far
	and wide; but the Muses collected them together and buried
	him at the place called Leibethra \[in Macedonia\].” It
	has been persuasively argued that Aeschylus’ story reflects

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Cf. Euripides, [c dimgray]Bacchae[/c] 618–622 (Pentheus tries to tie up a

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The metre is, appropriately, bacchiac (based on the unit ⏑ ‒ ‒).
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Punning on a popular etymology of Ἀπόλλων, as Cassandra
	does in [c dimgray]Agamemnon[/c] 1080–2: Dionysus, whom Orpheus has rejected,
	is in this sense more truly his “Apollon” than the god he
	now worships who actually bears that name.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The metre is again bacchiac, and this fragment, whose first line is quoted
	by Hephaestion directly after the first line of fr. 23, was almost
	certainly part of the same lyric sequence, probably sung by the
	chorus after Orpheus has fled from the scene. Evidently, as in Euripides’
	[c dimgray]Bacchae[/c], the chorus are a group of bacchants distinct
	from those who actually kill the central figure; this moment in the
	play will correspond to [c dimgray]Bacchae[/c] 977–1023.

	[c dimgray]The Glaucus of this play was a fisherman of Anthedon, on
	the Boeotian shore of the Euripus facing Euboea. Having
	caught and landed a fish, he threw it on some grass; it ate
	the grass and came back to life. Glaucus then ate the grass
	himself, leaped into the sea and became a sea-god with prophetic
	powers. See Pausanias 9.22.7; Ovid[/c], Metamorphoses
	13.917–965; [c dimgray]and the scholia to Euripides[/c], Orestes 364
	[c dimgray]and to Lycophron[/c], Alexandra 754. [c dimgray]It is not clear how the
	story was given dramatic shape; since Glaucus was a character
	after his transformation (fr. 29), it probably had a
	seashore setting. In the papyrus fragment 25e a countryman,
	probably an oxherd, seems to be reporting the first
	appearance of the new god in the waters of the Euripus;[/c]

	[c dimgray]according to Plato[/c] (Republic [c dimgray]611c-d) he was almost unrecognizable
	because his body had been battered by the wave
	and covered with stones, seaweed and shellfish (cf. fr. 34).
	Glaucus himself will have come on stage in a later scene,
	and his appearance will presumably have answered to this
	description. This grotesquerie, the theme of revivification
	and immortality, and the apparent absence of any tragically
	sinister plot-features, have suggested to many that
	this was a satyr-play, and this would be confirmed by the

	[b]ΓΛΑΥΚΟΣ ΠΟΤΝΙΕΥΣ[/b]
	[c dimgray]Glaucus of Potniae (a town about 2 km south of Thebes)
	was famous for having been devoured by his own mares
	during the chariot-race at the funeral games for Pelias.
	Our sources give various explanations of how this came
	to happen, which are not necessarily incompatible. The
	fourth-century scholar Asclepiades, in his Tales Told
	in Tragedy[/c] [c dimgray]([/c]Τραγῳδούμενα: FGrH [c dimgray]12 F 1), said that
	Glaucus had reared the mares on human flesh, to make
	them fiercer in war, and that they turned on him when they
	ran short of this food; his source was almost certainly Aeschylus’
	drama, since no other major tragic dramatist made
	this story the subject of a play. Virgil, however[/c] (Georgics
	[c dimgray]3.266–8[/c]),  in a passage on the power of sexual desire in
	horses and other animals, ascribes the madness of Glaucus’
	mares to the influence of Venus/Aphrodite, and his commentator
	Servius (ad loc.) says this was because he had neglected
	her worship and/or because, in order to increase
	the mares’ speed, he had not allowed them to mate. In the
	fragments of the play we can probably detect Glaucus de-

	[c dimgray]parting for the games (cf. fr. 36.5–6), perhaps after an attempt
	to dissuade him (fr. 37 may be his reply to this); the
	catastrophe will have been narrated in a messenger-speech
	(frr. 38 and 39, and parts of fr. 36b), apparently to Glaucus’
	wife (fr. 36b.2.II.9[/c] γύναι lady), [c dimgray]and fr. 36b.7 may possibly
	contain an affirmation of the power of Aphrodite[/c].
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Glaucus of Potniae [c dimgray]was produced together with[/c] Persians
	[c dimgray]in 472 (see Introduction to[/c] Persians, [c dimgray]where the possibility
	is discussed that it may have included a prophecy of
	the defeat of the Carthaginians at Himera in 480). In this
	connection it is striking that Glaucus, like Xerxes, is being
	punished in part for violating the order of nature (Xerxes
	turned sea into land; Glaucus is turning grass-eating animals
	into flesh-eaters and denying them the right to breed).[/c]

	[c dimgray]The papyrus fragments, though preserved and published
	separately (as[/c] Oxyrhynchus Papyrus [c dimgray]2160 and[/c] PSI
	[c dimgray]1210), are all parts of the same copy. Except for fr. 36 and

	[b]ΔΙΚΤΥΟΥΛΚΟΙ[/b]
	[c dimgray]We owe our knowledge of this play almost entirely to a series
	of papyrus fragments, which confirmed the guess of
	Gottfried Hermann that the play was set on the island of
	Seriphos (mentioned in fr. 47b.1) and dealt with the arrival
	there of Danaë and the infant Perseus, whom Danaë’s father
	Acrisius had set adrift on the sea in a wooden chest,
	and the kind reception given them by Dictys, the brother
	of the local king Polydectes. The fragments show plainly
	that the play was a satyr-drama, and it is tempting to associate
	it with two other plays about Perseus[/c], Phorcides [c dimgray]and[/c]
	Polydectes; [c dimgray]however, no fourth play suggests itself to complete
	a tetralogy.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]The first major fragment (46a) comes from the prologue:
	a fisherman has apparently netted a large object offshore,
	and seeks help in bringing it to land. The fragment
	ends with a call for all and sundry to come and help, which
	will have brought the satyrs onstage. There will then have
	been a long scene, from which the play took its name, during
	which the chest is hauled on shore; fr. 46c gives us a
	snatch of this. Finally the chest will have been landed;
	Dictys (who seems to have been present from the start)
	must have gone away for some reason, and the satyrs open[/c]

	[c dimgray]the chest and find Danaë and Perseus in it. Their intense
	erotic interest in Danaë, which dominates fr. 47a, will undoubtedly,
	as is usual, have come to nothing, and Dictys
	will eventually have rescued her.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]To the thirty-sixth line of fr. 47a is prefixed the letter
	theta, a “stichometric” mark indicating that this was the
	800th line of the play; but we are clearly then still some way
	from the end of the action, so it seems likely that this satyr-drama
	was about as long as most of Aeschylus’ surviving
	tragedies—in marked contrast to a later satyr-drama such
	as Euripides’[/c] Cyclops, [c dimgray]which at 709 lines is less than half
	the length of an average Euripidean tragedy.[/c]

	πέμπετον “you two are sending”, in the next line) rather than two

	claims (without reference to Aeschylus).

	and you tribe of charcoal-burners! \[ . . . \] most adverse \[ . . .
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Fragment 46b, also from PSI 1209, is too scanty to offer any continuous
	sense, but it must come from a stage of the play when
	Dictys had already left the scene, since he is referred to in the third
	Person[/c] (Δίκτυν\[ϲ\]), [c dimgray]2), and the speaker (Silenus?) appears to regard
	him as a[/c] πολέμι \[ enemy [c dimgray](4). Other words that can be read
	are[/c] ἄλγoϲ pain [c dimgray](1)[/c], ὄμμα ̣ \[ eye(s) [c dimgray](5),[/c] ποταί\[ιον fresh [c dimgray](6),[/c]
	\[ο\]ὐ καλῶϲ not well [c dimgray](7), and[/c] \[πρ\]έϲβυϲ old man [c dimgray](9).[/c]

	and \[. . .\], come to our aid . . . \[ . . . \] And don’t let go of the
	\[r\]o\[p\]e!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]The satyrs have evidently been trying to haul in the chest without
	success, and Silenus (?) calls for yet further assistance, at the same
	time warning the satyrs not to allow themselves to be distracted.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Lloyd-Jones (537 n.1) suggests that this may have been an alternative
	title for the ἅλιος γέρων, the Old Man of the Sea ([c dimgray]Odyssey[/c]
	4.384, 13.96, etc.).
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]Probably about this point Dictys
	and the fisherman make a vain attempt to haul in the chest, before
	Dictys decides that further assistance is needed.

	[c dimgray]Our information about this play comes mainly from a reference
	to it in Plutarch’s[/c] Life of Theseus [c dimgray](29.4–5), which
	shows that it dealt with the same events as Euripides’[/c] Suppliants—[c dimgray]the
	recovery by Theseus, at the request of Adrastus,
	of the bodies of the Seven against Thebes, which the
	Theban authorities were refusing to release for burial. In
	Euripides, Theseus secures possession of the bodies by defeating
	the Thebans in battle; in Aeschylus, according
	to Plutarch (compare also Isocrates,[/c] Panathenaicus [c dimgray]168–171),
	he did so by a negotiated agreement, and afterwards[/c]

	[c dimgray]The story of the Epigoni—the sons of the Seven against
	Thebes, who succeeded where their fathers had failed, capturing
	and destroying the city—was the subject of one of
	the poems in the Epic Cycle. The only clue to Aeschylus’
	treatment of the story is the reference in fr. 55 to the pouring
	of libations in connection with a wedding; but whose
	wedding can it have been? One of the Epigoni was Alcmeon,
	son of Amphiaraus and Eriphyle, and Sophocles’[/c]
	Epigoni [c dimgray](whether or not it was the same play as his[/c]
	Eriphyle[c dimgray]) was centred on the story of Alcmeon’s killing
	of his mother in revenge for her treachery against
	Amphiaraus in sending him to his death at Thebes; and a

	culminated in the matricide, all against the background
	of the attack upon Thebes, and probably involving Adrastus

	[b]ΗΔΩΝΟΙ[/b]
	[c dimgray]This was the first play of the tetralogy known as the[/c]
	Lycurgeia [c dimgray](Aristophanes,[/c] Women at the Thesmophoria
	[c dimgray]135) and probably, except for the satyr-drama[/c] Lycurgus,
	 the only one in which Lycurgus, king of the Edonians (a
	Thracian people living near the river Strymon), actually
	appeared. It told the story of his attempt to suppress the
	worship of Dionysus in his kingdom, along more or less the
	same lines as \[Apollodorus,\] Library 3.5.1. At the start of
	the play Dionysus had just arrived in Thrace with his
	male and female followers. Lycurgus had both him and
	the women bacchants arrested, but they miraculously escaped,
	and Dionysus then drove Lycurgus mad, so that
	he killed his own son Dryas with an axe, believing that
	he was cutting a vine-branch. Lycurgus may well in the
	end, as in \[Apollodorus\] and as in Sophocles, Antigone
	[c dimgray]955–965, have been imprisoned perpetually in a rocky
	chamber on Mount Pangaeum. It has been attractively
	conjectured that Orpheus, who was the central figure of
	The following play[/c] (Bassarids, [c dimgray]q.v.), also figured in this
	one, before his apostasy, as a devotee (maybe a priest) of[/c]

	[c dimgray]Dionysus, imprisoned with his master by Lycurgus (cf. fr.
	60); West, Studies 29–30, has suggested that Orpheus
	“warned Lycurgus of the unwisdom of theomachy”, but
	that his warnings were ignored. This play was extensively
	imitated by Euripides when he wrote about the fate of another
	enemy of Dionysus in[/c] The Bacchae, [c dimgray]and the Roman
	poet Naevius in his[/c] Lucurgos [c dimgray]seems to have followed it
	closely.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]The apparent presence of a stage-building (fr. 58) suggests
	that this was a late play of Aeschylus, and West,
	Studies 48–50, has argued that there is other evidence
	corroborating this. If so, Aeschylus will have been following
	in the footsteps of Polyphrasmon, son of his old rival

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]This river was very vaguely located by early Greeks. Herodotus
	(3.115) criticized poets who spoke of the Eridanus as flowing into
	“the sea to the north . . . on the far side of Europe”. By the time of
	Euripides ([c dimgray]Hippolytus[/c] 737–741) the Eridanus was envisaged as
	flowing into the Adriatic, and perhaps already identified with the
	Po; and fr. 71 seems to be consistent with this view. Pliny’s statement
	that Aeschylus located the river in Iberia and identified it
	with the Rhodanus (Rhône) may be explained by supposing
	that Aeschylus believed the Po and the Rhône to be joined together,
	far inland (an idea later exploited by Apollonius Rhodius,
	[c dimgray]Argonautica[/c] 4.627–8), and that, like several other fifth- and
	fourth-century writers, he thought of “Iberia” as beginning at the
	Rhône rather than at the Pyrenees (cf. Herodorus fr. 2 Fowler
	\[Iberian tribes extending as far as the Rhône\]; Scylax, [c dimgray]Periplous[/c] 3
	\[a mixed population of Iberians and Ligurians between the Pyrenees
	and the Rhône\]; Thucydides 6.2.2 \[the Sicans displaced
	by Ligurians from the river Sicanus in Iberia\]; and probably Herodotus
	1.163.1 \[“Tyrrhenia, Iberia and Tartessus” apparently representing
	the whole European shore from the Tiber to Cadiz\]).

	[c dimgray]All that can be said with confidence about this play is that it
	dealt in some way with the fate of Heracles’ children after
	the end of his earthly life, and that he himself made an appearance
	in it, probably as a god (frr. 73b, 75a); perhaps
	his family had not previously known of his apotheosis. It is
	not unlikely that Aeschylus, like Euripides in his play of the
	same name, presented the story, of which Athenians were
	always proud, of how Athens had defended Heracles’ children
	against their father’s old persecutor Eurystheus; but
	there is simply no actual evidence either for or against this

	[b]ΘΑΛΑΜΟΠΟΙΟΙ[/b]
	[c dimgray]Of this play we know nothing for sure except that it existed
	and, as fr. 78 shows, was indeed concerned with the building
	of a chamber or chambers—very likely, in view of the
	usual connotations of[/c] θάλαμος [c dimgray]in tragedy, for one or more
	bridal couples. The apparent presence of a chorus employed
	on a building project has led to its being widely,
	though not universally, accepted that this was a satyrdrama[/c].
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]It has, however, been twice independently suggested
	in recent years that fr. 451l Radt ([/c]Oxyrhynchus Papyrus
	[c dimgray]2254) may come from[/c] Chamber-Makers. [c dimgray]The fragment
	is almost certainly from a satyr-drama, as the reference
	to[/c] these beasts [c dimgray](line 15) indicates; it makes mention of a[/c]
	θάλαμος [c dimgray](line 22) and of a wife (line 26); and the reference
	to someone or something[/c] Teucrian [c dimgray](line 25), and what
	seems to be an address to Priam (line 12), make it likely
	that the play was set in Troy. Mette had already proposed
	that the fragment might come from a satyr-drama linked
	to the Achilles trilogy[/c] (Myrmidons, Nereids, Phrygians),

	[b]Chamber-Makers[/b]
	[c dimgray]and[/c] Chamber-Makers [c dimgray]could well be that play; the fragment
	is accordingly treated here as belonging to[/c] Chamber-Makers,  and renumbered 78a. Since only one chamber
	appears to be in question, the play probably centred on a
	single rather than a multiple wedding. Di Marco thought
	of Paris and Helen, but there is perhaps more to be said for
	Hector and Andromache:[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Hector, unlike Paris or Helen,
	was an important figure in the Achilles trilogy, offstage at
	first but later (as a corpse) onstage, and Aeschylus seems to
	have gone out of his way in Phrygians to mention Hector’s
	marriage (fr. 267).

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]This story, which appears to be distinctively Attic (though a

	by a series of vase-paintings, the earliest from about 460 bc, discussed
	by C. A. Faraone, [c dimgray]JHS[/c] 117 (1997) 43–46.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The wedding of Hector and Andromache, and the great public

	[c dimgray]Our knowledge of this play is almost entirely dependent on

	Their arrangement is now fairly firmly established, except
	for one narrow strip (fr. 78b). The scene is before the temple
	of Poseidon at the Isthmus of Corinth, the occasion that
	of a celebration of the Isthmian Games. The “story so far”
	appears to be that Dionysus has been training the satyrs
	for a dancing performance at a great festival (33, 71–74),
	but that they have run away from him, decided to become
	athletes instead, and been taken under the wing of another

	[c dimgray](rival claimants to the title of founder of the Games), as
	Daedalus, and as Hephaestus. In the papyrus, we first see
	the satyrs receiving likenesses of themselves (possibly in
	the form of masks), at which they marvel (1–17); they are
	about to fix them on the front of the temple (18–22) when
	Dionysus enters and upbraids, mocks and threatens them
	for their disloyalty to him (23–78). They remain defiant
	(79–84). Someone then presents the satyrs with some “new
	toys” made with adze and anvil, which they are reluctant
	to accept (85ff); this may be their new protector returning,
	bringing athletic equipment (e.g. javelins) for the games,
	but it is more probably Dionysus, displaying shackles
	which he will make them wear if they remain disobedient
	to him (see Taplin, Stagecraft 421–2). In the end the satyrs
	will certainly have been reconciled to Dionysus, but we
	cannot tell how this may have come about. The play must[/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The “Lesbian cyma(tium)”—now usually called [c dimgray]cyma reversa[/c]—was
	a moulding typical of the Ionic order. It was usually
	ornamented with the “leaf-and-dart” pattern, in the simpler forms
	of which the “leaf” is a pendent shape rather like a heraldic shield,
	i.e. a triangle with bulging curved sides and its apex at the bottom.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Dionysus[/b][/c]
	Ah, I was bound to find you some time, my good fellows! I
	won’t say of you that you travelled[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] incognito: your journey
	it\[self\] con\[firmed\] this for me . . . seeing these \[tracks (?)\]
	. . . \[ . . . informed (?) me of t\]his and gave me clear guidance.
	\[I knew (?) . . . \], when I saw your \[phalli\] short like a
	mouse’s tail,[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] that you were polishing up your Isthmian
	\[wrestling\], and that you hadn’t neglected it but were in
	good training.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] Well, if you’d stayed faithful to the old
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]From ὁδοιπορῶν and κέλευθος we can gather that the satyrs’
	previous lodgings had been some distance from the Isthmus
	(perhaps in Corinth city, but quite possibly further afield, e.g.
	Phleius—home town of the first great satyr-dramatist, Pratinas—or
	even Athens) and that they had then absconded.
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]The reference is to the practice, regular among ancient Greek athletes,
	of tying up the penis in a curled shape (just “like a mouse’s
	tail”) by a string tied round the foreskin and then round the waist
	(often, but wrongly, called “infibulation”). See D. Sansone, [c dimgray]Greek
	Athletics and the Genesis of Sport[/c] (Berkeley, 1988) 119–122 and
	figs. 20, 22, 23. For the satyrs to come on stage in this condition
	would make a striking contrast with their accustomed state of hyper-erection.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]There is probably a [c dimgray]double entendre[/c] in this
	sentence πάλη and derivatives, (ἐκ)τρίβειν, γυμνάζομαι, and
	references to the Isthmus, were all capable of being understood in
	sexual senses (see J. J. Henderson, [c dimgray]The Maculate Muse[/c] \[New Haven,
	1975\] 137–8, 169, 176; Palaestra, Gymnasium and Isthmias
	were all names of real or fictitious [c dimgray]hetairai[/c])—which might suggest
	an alternative explanation for the state of the satyrs’ phalli!

	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]lit. “may you perish miserably”.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]Calculations of where the beginnings of lines would stand in the papyrus suggest that
	this speech, and possibly also Dionysus’ reply, were in trochaic
	tetrameters rather than iambic trimeters.
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]Silenus may

	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c]Kamerbeek attractively suggested that the satyrs had been
	intending not only to wrestle but also to compete in the foot-race
	in armour (ὁπλιτοδρομία).
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c]lit. “soak” (like a garment being washed); cf. the English
	phrase “take to the cleaners” (= criticize severely).
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c]This seems to indicate that in Aeschylus’ time the normal
	formation of a satyric chorus was in two rows (with six performers
	in each). According to Pollux (4.108–9), the [c dimgray]tragic[/c] chorus (in the
	later fifth century, when it had fifteen members) normally performed
	in three rows of five; it is a plausible, but far from secure,
	inference that both types of chorus (which were composed of the
	same performers) changed from two to three rows at the same
	time as they changed their numbers.

	there were originally crowned with a pine wreath, later replaced
	by a celery wreath in imitation of the Nemean games (see Plutarch,

	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]If Dionysus is indeed here referring to the objects soon to
	be offered to the chorus as “novel toys”, the fact that (so far as we
	know) neither he nor the chorus has made any previous mention
	of them in the 55 lines he has been on stage makes it likely that
	they are not in his own hands but are being carried by attendants,
	who hitherto have been positioned unobtrusively but now step

	81), which one would expect to be followed up when the satyrs remain

	[c dimgray]We learn from scholia on Sophocles’ Ajax (on lines 134, 815
	and 833) that this play included the suicide of Ajax, which
	was narrated by a messenger; that Ajax was invulnerable
	except in one spot (because, when he was a baby, Heracles
	had covered him with his lion-skin), and as a result was
	unable to strike himself the fatal blow until “a goddess”
	(Athena?) showed him the right place to do so (the armpit);
	and that the “Thracian women” of the chorus were war
	captives. The play almost certainly followed[/c] The Award of
	the Arms [c dimgray](q.v.), and the third play of the trilogy is likely to
	have been[/c] Women of Salamis ([c dimgray]q.v.[/c])
	[m1]\ [/m]

	And, since his skin would not yield anywhere to the fatal

	[c dimgray]Of the two well-known stories about Ixion, that of his
	treacherous murder of his father-in-law (D)eïoneus appears
	to have been dramatized by Aeschylus in[/c] Perrhaebian
	Women [c dimgray](q.v.). This leaves for[/c] Ixion [c dimgray]the other tale,
	which follows on from it, of how gods and men alike were
	so horrified at this murder (the first ever committed in
	which the victim was a kinsman) that none of them was
	willing to purify Ixion; of how Zeus at length took pity on
	him, and not only purified him but took him up to heaven;
	of how Ixion, despite having received this great boon from
	Zeus, committed the ultimate[/c] hybris [c dimgray]of attempting to seduce
	Hera (Zeus deceived him into lying instead with a
	cloud in her shape); and of how in punishment he was

	Aeschylus refers twice in[/c] Eumenides [c dimgray](439–441, 717–8) to
	Ixion’s successful supplication to Zeus (though not to its
	consequences). It is not clear, however, how the tale can
	have been adapted for dramatic treatment, nor even
	whether it was a tragedy or a satyr-drama (fr. 90 suggests
	the former, fr. 91 the latter). The setting, at any rate, was
	evidently on earth, not in heaven, so probably Ixion was
	depicted in his period of isolation as an abhorred, polluted
	murderer with whom no one would associate—except,
	maybe, the satyrs? The play need not have been produced

	Since the verb καταπίνω “swallow whole, gulp down”—here apparently
	used metaphorically to mean “vanquish easily”—is not
	found in tragedy proper, this fragment should probably be assigned
	to a satyr chorus and indicates the genre of the play. It has
	sometimes been found tempting to interpret the fragment as applying
	figuratively to the transgressions of Ixion, but it is more
	likely to relate to something of more interest to satyrs.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]In itself the phrase could also mean “to be reviled by
	women” (for the two senses compare, respectively, Epicharmus
	fr. 32.6 K-A and Sophocles, [c dimgray]Ajax[/c] 722); but χρὴ (the only other
	possible supplement, δεῖ, means in Aeschylus “it is needed”, “it is
	necessary”, or “it is destined”, none of which fits the context here)
	asserts an ethical or social [c dimgray]duty[/c], and it makes no sense to speak of
	an ethical or social duty not to be reviled by women. The speaker
	is thus probably a woman, and quite possibly Clytaemestra, who in
	[c dimgray]Agamemnon[/c] is very sensitive to male disparagement or condescension.

	[c dimgray]The Cabeiri were minor gods, with varying attributes and

	the northern Aegean, especially Thebes and Lemnos. From
	Athenaeus (10.428f) we learn that Jason and his companions
	appeared in this play, and that in one scene they
	were drunk; since the passage blames Aeschylus for being
	“the first to introduce the sight of drunken men into tragedy”,
	it is clear that this play was a tragedy, not a satyr-drama,
	in which drunkenness would have been nothing
	unusual. The play included a catalogue of the Argonauts
	(so the scholia to Pindar,[/c] Pythian  4.\[171\] 303). It has usually
	been associated with the Argonauts’ stay in Lemnos, as
	a sequel to Hypsipyle [c dimgray](q.v.). Deforge (see below) has suggested

	[b]ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΩ[/b]
	[c dimgray]The maiden Callisto was a hunting companion of Artemis
	in Arcadia; she was made pregnant by Zeus, and before
	giving birth was transformed into a bear (by Zeus or Hera
	or Artemis); her child, however (who in some accounts
	had to be taken from her womb after Artemis had shot her),
	was a human one, Arcas, the eponymous ancestor of the
	Arcadians. Callisto’s ultimate destiny, by order of Zeus,
	was to be placed in the heavens as the constellation of the
	Great Bear. There are very many variant forms of this
	story (see for example Hesiod fr. 163; Pausanias 8.3.6–[/c]

	[b]ΚΑΡΕΣ Η ΕΥΡΩΠΗ[/b]
	 Europa, who in most accounts is a Phoenician by birth and
	a sister of Cadmus, was abducted by Zeus in the form of
	a bull (or, in this play, by a bull sent by Zeus \[fr. 99.1–2\])
	and taken to Crete, where she gave birth to Minos and
	Rhadamanthys; in some accounts, including the one followed
	in this play, she also has a third son, Sarpedon, destined
	to be killed at Troy (so Hesiod frr. 140, 141). In this
	play Europa, who must now be elderly, is evidently living
	in Caria—which, as Strabo (14.3.3) complains, the dramatist
	seems to have identified or confused with Sarpedon’s
	homeland of Lycia; Minos is dead (implied by fr. 99.12),
	Rhadamanthys though immortal has departed from earth,
	and she is anxious about the welfare of Sarpedon. There
	can be little doubt that the play culminated in the arrival of

	[c dimgray]Our only clue to the subject of this play is fr. 116, a description

	this almost certainly links it to the story of Polyidus,
	which was the subject of Sophocles’[/c] Seers [c dimgray]and Euripides’[/c]
	Polyidus.  The story is told by \[Apollodorus\], Library [c dimgray]3.3.1–2
	and Hyginus[/c], Fabulae [c dimgray]136. Glaucus, son of Minos, went
	missing when a child, and Minos was told that he would be
	found by the person who could suggest the best analogy to
	describe a marvellous cow in Minos’ herd which continually
	changed colour—now black, now white, now red. The
	seer Polyidus compared it to a blackberry, and was duly
	asked to find the boy; but he found him dead, drowned in
	a vat of honey. Minos demanded that he restore the boy
	to life; Polyidus did not know how to achieve this, but[/c]

	[c dimgray]while shut up with the corpse, he saw a snake bring another

	Glaucus. Minos then demanded that Polyidus teach
	Glaucus the art of divination as the price of being allowed
	to leave Crete, and Polyidus did so, but when his ship was
	getting under way for home he told Glaucus to spit into his
	mouth, and Glaucus instantly forgot all that Polyidus had
	taught him. That this story, in something very like this
	form, was already current in the fifth century we know
	from a white-ground cup of about 440 bc[/c] (London D5)

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]If the “chilling approach” is indeed that of a person, then,

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]It is clear from the lexica that ancient grammarians found
	an adjective ἀθερής in Aeschylus’ text but had no idea what it

	would derive the adjective from θέρειν “to heat”, cf. εἱληθερής, ἡλιοθερής,

	[b]ΜΥΡΜΙΔΟΝΕΣ[/b]
	[c dimgray]This was the first play of a trilogy based on the[/c] Iliad, [c dimgray]being
	followed by[/c] Nereids [c dimgray]and[/c] Phrygians [c dimgray](qq.v.) and perhaps
	by the satyr-drama[/c] Chamber-Makers [c dimgray](q.v.) It corresponded
	approximately to books 9–18 of the epic, and its
	setting appears to have been within the hut of Achilles (fr.
	131.3–4; for imaginary interior settings in the pre[/c]-skene
	[c dimgray]theatre, cf[/c]. Persians [c dimgray]140–1). Achilles sat silent and veiled
	for a long time (cf. Aristophanes[/c], Frogs [c dimgray]911–5), ignoring
	the pleas of his followers the Myrmidons (frr. 131, 132).
	Eventually his old tutor Phoenix persuaded him to break
	his silence (fr. 132b), but only to emphasize, and explain,
	his determination not to go to the aid of the Achaean army
	(fr. 132c). Eventually, when word came that the ships were
	being set on fire (fr. 134), Patroclus, we may presume, as in
	the[/c] Iliad, [c dimgray]persuaded Achilles—in Aeschylus’ treatment the
	two were lovers (Plato,[/c] Symposium [c dimgray]180a; cf. frr. 135–7)—to
	let him go into battle in Achilles’ armour; and presently
	Antilochus (fr. 138) brought Achilles the shattering news of
	Patroclus’ death after splendid heroic exploits (cf. Aristophanes,[/c]
	Frogs [c dimgray]1041), which was soon followed by the arrival
	of Patroclus’ corpse (cf. frr. 135–7). Achilles, as in[/c]

	[c dimgray]Homer, blamed himself for sending Patroclus to his doom
	(fr. 139) and was desperate to go into battle and avenge him
	(fr. 140), but could not, because he now had no armour.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]A series of vase paintings, showing Odysseus addressing
	an Achilles who is muffled up in his cloak, is probably
	to be associated with our play, particularly since there
	is a parallel series linkable to[/c] Nereids. [c dimgray]By the generally
	accepted dating, the earliest of these vases belongs to the
	490s, but vase dating is not an exact science, and it is unlikely
	that this tetralogy, which was one of Aeschylus’ most
	famous productions, predates his first victory in 484. It
	may very well, indeed, have been the production with
	which he won that victory and made his name for life.[/c]

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Achilles’ point is that by stoning him the Achaean army would be
	doing themselves no good: he would still, even in death, be benefiting
	the Trojans by depriving their enemies of his fighting
	strength.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]This rendering does not claim to do more than
	give the apparent general sense of the sentence. For death as the
	“healer of troubles” cf. frr. 255, 353.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]lit. “because of a bad
	shepherd” (i.e. Agamemnon, “shepherd of the people” in Homeric
	phrase).
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]I have followed Norsa & Vitelli’s restorations
	and sentence-divisions in lines 9 and 11. The main alternative,
	represented by Steffen’s restoration in line 9 (see apparatus),
	would make the sense run approximately: “Shall I, for fear of the
	Achaeans, set myself in motion . . ., I who all on my own . . . caused
	so much harm by my absence from battle? I alone am everything
	to the Achaean army.”

	diffident (cf. fr. 132b.5), and it is at least as likely that the speaker

	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]The demonstrative adjective implies a gesture, possibly towards
	Odysseus if he is present (but even if there was an “embassy”
	scene in the play—for which we have only the uncertain
	evidence of the vase-paintings—Achilles could not have made this
	speech before Phoenix had succeeded in breaking his silence, and
	to have Odysseus present at that stage would require three actors, impossible in an earlyish play), more likely an angry wave in the
	direction in which the rest of the Achaean camp is supposed to lie.
	(Achilles and his men were right at one end of the encampment:
	[c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 8.225–6, 11.8–9.)
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]Cycnus was killed by Achilles at the
	very beginning of the Trojan War ([c dimgray]Cypria[/c] Arg. §10 West); that
	Achilles is speaking of an event early in the war is clear from his
	reference to his “young arms”.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]If this reading, or something

	[c dimgray]The central character of[/c] Mysians [c dimgray]was Telephus. This can be
	inferred from the mention in the play (fr. 145) of Oeum, a
	village near Telephus’ birthplace Tegea in Arcadia, and
	also from Aristotle’s criticism[/c] (Poetics [c dimgray]1460 a[/c]30–32) of “the
	man in Mysians [c dimgray]who came from Tegea to Mysia without
	ever speaking”—for though Sophocles also wrote a play
	called[/c] Mysians [c dimgray]in which a man, almost certainly Telephus,
	arrives in Mysia from abroad, we know that in Sophocles’
	play this man immediately asks a native what country he is
	in (Sophocles fr. 411). The Aeschylean Telephus had been
	silent because he was under blood-pollution (cf.[/c] Eumenides [c dimgray]448–450), having killed his maternal uncles, the sons[/c]

	[c dimgray]Unless this play took its title from the town of Nemea
	or from the Nemean Games (which would be very abnormal,
	either for a tragedy or for a satyr-drama), the title
	must refer to the only known mythical character of that
	name, and probably to the only story about her that is attested
	(by an introductory scholium to Pindar’s[/c] Nemeans),
	[c dimgray]namely that she was the mother of the child Archemorus
	who was killed by a snake at Philus while the expedition of
	the Seven against Thebes was passing through the town,
	and in whose memory their leader, Adrastus, founded the
	Nemean Games. If so, the play will have corresponded[/c]

	[b]ΝΗΡΕΙΔΕΣ[/b]
	[c dimgray]This play has nearly always been regarded as the second
	play of the Achilles trilogy, following[/c] Myrmidons [c dimgray]and preceding[/c] Phrygians ([c dimgray]qq.v.) In the[/c] Iliad [c dimgray](18.35–147), Thetis is
	accompanied by her sisters the Nereids when she comes to
	comfort Achilles after the death of Patroclus, and later
	(19.1–39) she returns alone bringing him the new armour
	which Hephaestus has made. Aeschylus merged these two
	visits into one, making Thetis and the Nereids together
	bring Achilles his armour; the play then probably continued
	with Achilles’ preparations for battle, a report of
	his exploits including the killing of Hector, the funeral of
	Patroclus (cf. fr. 153) and perhaps Achilles’ abusive treatment
	of Hector’s body—roughly the material contained in
	books 19–23 of the[/c] Iliad.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]However, the few surviving fragments explicitly attributed
	to the play contain nothing that obviously refers to
	Hector, Patroclus, or Achilles’ new armour, and it has been
	possible for West (see below) to argue that[/c] Nereids [c dimgray]was the
	third, not the second, play of the trilogy, and that its subject
	was the death of Achilles. West’s arguments are not[/c]

	begins another series (LIMC Achilles nos. 510–525), showing
	Thetis bringing Achilles his new armour, in which, contrary

	[b]NIOBH[/b]
	 Niobe, daughter of Tantalus and wife of Amphion of
	Thebes, offended Apollo and Artemis (and/or their mother
	Leto) by boasting that she had many fine children (in
	Aeschylus the number was fourteen) while Leto had had
	only two; Apollo and Artemis punished her by destroying
	all her children, and she wept inconsolably until the gods
	transformed her into a rock at Mount Sipylus in Lydia
	which continued to shed tears (Iliad 24. 602–617). [c dimgray]Aeschylus’
	play began after the catastrophe, with Niobe sitting
	veiled and wordless at her children’s tomb (fr. 154a. 6–7;
	Aristophanes,[/c] Frogs 911–920; Life of Aeschylus 5); [c dimgray]later
	her father came to Thebes (frr. 154a. 10, 158, 159), presumably
	to comfort her so far as he could and to take her home
	to Lydia, her husband Amphion being probably also dead
	(cf. Ovid,[/c] Metamorphoses [c dimgray]6.271). It is hard to see how
	there can have been much plot development, and the play
	is likely to have concerned itself mainly with Tantalus’ efforts
	to understand, and to come to terms with, so appalling
	a disaster, and to persuade his daughter to do likewise.[/c]

	[b]ΞΑΝΤΡΙΑΙ[/b]
	[c dimgray]This play is known to have dealt with the fate of an enemy
	of Dionysus at the hands of female bacchants: in fr. 169
	Lyssa, the goddess of madness, urges them on to tear
	their victim in pieces. The death of Pentheus was certainly
	mentioned in the play (fr. 172b), and its location was
	Mount Cithaeron, as in Euripides’[/c]Bacchae.[c dimgray]Since an ancient
	headnote (Hypothesis) to[/c] Bacchae [c dimgray]names[/c] Pentheus
	[c dimgray](q.v.) as the Aeschylean play running parallel to it, it has
	often been suspected that Pentheus’ death was not part of
	the action of [/c]Wool-Carders[c dimgray]but was only predicted in it. In
	view of fr. 169, however, we would then have to suppose
	that in the play named after him Pentheus only appeared
	as a corpse, if at all—for which there would be no parallel[/c]

	[c dimgray]in what we know of Greek tragedy. This is probably, all the

	two names for the same play (but Galen quotes lines from
	both plays \[frr. 170, 183\], each under its own title, in the
	same passage) and (ii) that the plot of Wool-Carders [c dimgray]had
	nothing to do with Pentheus at all but dealt with another
	Dionysiac story, such as that of the daughters of Minyas
	who resisted Dionysus, were driven mad, and tore the
	son of one of themselves in pieces (but the late Hellenistic
	scholar Asclepiades—see on fr. 220a—clearly associated[/c]
	Wool-Carders [c dimgray]with the Cadmus-Semele-Pentheus story).

	later sources bar one (starting with Euripides, [c dimgray]Orestes[/c] 5) he is a
	son of Zeus (the exception is a scholium to the same Euripidean
	passage, which names the mountain-god Tmolus as his father).

	after a body has been cremated (see e.g. Menander,[/c]The

	on the episode in the Odyssey (24.413ff) where the families
	of the suitors collect and bury their bodies (or ship them

	[c dimgray]The references to symposiac games in fr. 179, and to a

	many scholars to believe that[/c] Bone-Gatherers  was a satyr-play.
	To accept this, however, would force us to abandon
	the notion of an Odyssean tetralogy; moreover, Athenaeus
	(1.17c) criticizes Aeschylus (and Sophocles \[fr. 565\], who

	would fit well into such a scenario as part of a defence

	condemnation and execution, since fr. 181 shows
	that Palamedes’ father, Nauplius, came to Troy (as Sophocles
	later made him do in[/c] The Arrival of Nauplius)  and protested,
	doubtless to little effect, about what had been done

	as if to a feast and enticed him into entering a room

	there may have been mention of the establishment of his
	Athenian cult. The reconciliation may have been effected
	through Prometheus’ mother, Ge-Themis, whose name is
	wrongly included, together with that of Heracles, in the list
	of[/c] dramatis personae [c dimgray]appended to the Hypothesis to[/c] Prometheus
	Bound; [c dimgray]she had once before been responsible for

	Prometheus Unbound [c dimgray]appears to have been imitated or

	The “Wealth-Gods” of the chorus identify themselves as Titans

	makes a vast racket and, as it flies off into the sky, it licks my
	blood with its tail feathers. And when the liver on which it
	has fed has been renewed and reinflated, then it comes
	back and sets itself greedily again to its cruel feeding. Thus
	I provide nourishment to this warder of my wretched torture,
	who defiles my living body with endless misery; for
	held fast, as you see I am, in Zeus’s chains, I am unable to
	keep this terrible bird away from my breast. And so, bereaved
	of my own self, I endure a succession of anguishing
	torments, ever seeking an end to my suffering, longing
	for death. But the power of Zeus keeps death far away
	from me, and this ancient, lamentable atrocity, accumulated
	through generations of horror,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] is indelibly imprinted
	in my body—my body, from which fall drops[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] melted by

	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]Thirteen human generations have passed since Prometheus
	was first bound to the rock ([c dimgray]Prometheus Bound[/c] 774), during a long
	but undefined portion of which he was beneath the earth ([c dimgray]ibid.[/c]
	1020–1).
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]Drops of blood, or rather ichor. According to Apollonius
	Rhodius, [c dimgray]Argonautica[/c] 3.845–866, these drops caused a plant to
	spring up, an ointment extracted from which was later used by
	Medea to make Jason invulnerable for a day; this tale may go back
	to Sophocles’ [c dimgray]Women of Colchis[/c] (cf. the Hypothesis to [c dimgray]Prometheus
	Bound,[/c] and Sophocles fr. 340).
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]Cicero, like most who wrote about Prometheus in antiquity,
	thought that the Caucasus was the scene of his binding; it certainly
	was not so in [c dimgray]Prometheus Bound[/c] (cf. lines 719–720 of that play; the
	Hypothesis nevertheless asserts that the scene is “in Scythia on
	the Caucasian mountains”), and there is no reason to believe that
	it was so in [c dimgray]Prometheus Unbound[/c] either (see A. Bonnafé, [c dimgray]Journal
	des Savants[/c] \[1991\] 153–6). Cicero has doubtless added the word
	for metrical and/or stylistic reasons, unaware that he was introducing
	a geographical error.

	[c dimgray]that in the production of which it formed part, in 472 BC,
	the fourth play (i.e. the satyr-drama) was[/c] Prometheus.  (4)
	There are several papyrus fragments (frr. 204a-d), two
	quotations (frr. 206 \[187a\], 207), one other reference (fr.
	207a, from the scholia to Hesiod, Works and Days  89), and
	several vase-paintings, which connect satyrs with Prometheus
	and/or with fire.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	 From this evidence it is clear that there was an Aeschylean
	satyr-play, presumably the one produced in 472,
	in which Prometheus brought fire to the satyrs, who had
	never seen it before, were greatly delighted by it (particularly
	because they hoped its possession would make them
	more attractive to nymphs: fr. 204b), but had no idea how
	to handle it safely (frr. 206, 207). According to the Hesiod
	scholiast, Prometheus “received from the satyrs \[presumably
	in exchange for fire\] the jar of evils, and deposited

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Plutarch’s phrase πρὸς τὸν Ἡρακλέα could mean either
	“addressing Heracles” or “in reference to Heracles”, but τοῦτο in
	the actual quotation shows that Heracles is not being addressed
	and is probably not even present (otherwise the poet would probably
	have written e.g. τόνδε φίλτατον τόκον). Prometheus has
	been “saved” by Heracles (presumably from the eagle), so Plutarch
	tells us, but has evidently not yet been reconciled with Zeus;
	perhaps he is telling his mother (cf. introductory note to this play)
	about recent events?

	[c dimgray]It has usually been supposed, on the basis of (2), that[/c]

	Prometheus the Fire-Bearer [c dimgray]was a serious play forming a
	trilogy with[/c] Prometheus Bound [c dimgray]and[/c] Unbound. [c dimgray]There are,
	however, two serious objections to this view. On the one
	hand, there is no possible place for[/c] Prometheus the Fire-Bearer
	[c dimgray]in a tragic Prometheus-trilogy. It cannot have come
	first, because the exposition of the initial situation in[/c] Prometheus
	Bound [c dimgray](especially in 199–241) is so full and detailed
	as to preclude the possibility that the audience are
	being told all this for the second time; it cannot have come
	second, because Hermes’ prophecy in[/c] Prometheus Bound
	[c dimgray]1014–29 allows for no other events to intervene between
	Prometheus’ return to the daylight and the beginning of his
	torment by the eagle; and it cannot have come third, because[/c]
	Prometheus Unbound [c dimgray]is known to have wound up
	the story of Prometheus so completely that there can have
	been no scope for a further play about him (see introductory
	note to[/c] Prometheus Unbound). [c dimgray]On the other hand,
	since epithets were attached to play-titles precisely for the
	purpose of distinguishing between plays of the same name[/c]

	Prometheus [c dimgray]plays should be given epithets so similar as[/c]
	πυρφόρος [c dimgray]and[/c] πυρκαεύς. [c dimgray]More probably one of these epithets
	is a corruption of the other, and all the evidence summarized
	under (1–4) above relates to the same play, the
	satyr-play of 472. Brown (see below) has argued convincingly
	that the proper title of this play is[/c] Προμηθεὺς πυρφόρος,
	[c dimgray]and (following Dindorf in the 1829 edition of
	the[/c] Thesaurus Graecae Linguae, [c dimgray]s.v. πυρκαεύς) that the
	epithet πυρκαεύς, known only to Pollux, is an error caused
	by the existence of a Sophoclean play entitled Ναύπλιος
	Prometheus, unlike Nauplius, does not[/c] kindle
	[c dimgray]fire, in the satyr-drama or anywhere else; he[/c] brings [c dimgray]it to

	193), [c dimgray]in Herodotus (2.112–120), and in Euripides’[/c] Helen,
	[c dimgray]he was simply a human king of Egypt. We do not know how

	[b]ΣΕΜΕΛΗ Η ΥΔΡΟΦΟΡΟΙ[/b]
	[c dimgray]Until fairly recently our main information about this
	play came from a scholium on Apollonius Rhodius’[/c] Argonautica
	 (1.636) which stated that Aeschylus “brought
	\[Semele\] on stage pregnant and divinely possessed, and
	the women who touched her belly also became possessed”.
	These women must evidently have been the chorus of the
	play. They may have been laying hands on Semele’s belly to
	ease her labour pains (cf. Soranus, Gynaecology 2.4.1),
	[c dimgray]and perhaps had brought (hot) water to warm their hands
	for this purpose.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]The story of Semele’s death is told in many variants, but
	is almost always the same in essentials. Semele, daughter of
	Cadmus of Thebes, having been made pregnant by Zeus,
	was persuaded by the jealous Hera, who visted her in disguise,
	to ask Zeus to come to her in his full divine glory;[/c]

	[b]Semele [c dimgray]or[/c] Water-Carriers[/b]
	[c dimgray]Zeus, who had previously given her the right to have
	any one request granted, duly came, and Semele was destroyed
	by his lightnings and thunderbolts; Zeus, however,
	snatched the unborn Dionysus from her body, sewed him
	up in his own thigh, and kept him there till he was ready to
	come into the world. The actual or prospective birth of Dionysus
	was certainly a concern of our play, since there was
	mention of the Amphidromia (fr. 222), a household ritual
	for a new-born child; but the few short book-fragments
	that survive told us little more than this.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	 However, a papyrus published in 1941 (frr. 220a-c
	\[168, 168a-b\]) contains fragments of a choral song which
	mentions Semele and Cadmus, followed by hexameter

	[c dimgray]a mendicant priestess. Hera is not spoken of as having
	adopted this particular disguise in other versions of the
	Semele story, but no one would have doubted that these
	papyrus fragments were indeed from[/c] Semele, [c dimgray]were it not
	for one conflicting piece of evidence: the ancient scholar
	Asclepiades, cited in the scholia to Aristophanes,[/c] Frogs
	[c dimgray]1344, ascribes the first two of the hexameter lines (here fr.
	220a.16–17) to[/c] Wool-Carders [c dimgray](q.v.) and claims to have
	found them in a manuscript he consulted at Athens. This is
	itself a statement that arouses some suspicion, since it implies
	that the lines were[/c] not [c dimgray]in the texts of[/c] Wool-Carders
	 regularly used by the scholars of Alexandria, and in fact
	Asclepiades is a far from reliable witness on matters of this
	kind.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] We should certainly not feel it our duty to believe
	him if it entails supposing that Aeschylus brought a disguised
	Hera into Wool-Carders, [c dimgray]a play set at a time when
	Dionysus had grown to maturity and begun to act violently
	against enemies such as Pentheus, when every other mention

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Of the four other statements by Asclepiades about tragedy
	that survive in the Aristophanic scholia, one is certainly and one
	almost certainly wrong. In [c dimgray]Birds[/c] 348 he detects parody of Euripides’
	[c dimgray]Andromeda[/c], which was not produced until two years after
	[c dimgray]Birds[/c]; and he ascribes [c dimgray]Frogs[/c] 1270 (= Aesch. fr. 238) to Aeschylus’
	[c dimgray]Iphigeneia[/c] when another scholar, Timachidas, said it was from
	[c dimgray]Telephus[/c] (they were probably both guessing: see introductory
	note to [c dimgray]Telephus[/c]). It should be added, too, that [c dimgray]Frogs[/c] 1344 itself
	can hardly be derived from [c dimgray]Wool-Carders[/c] (as Asclepiades
	claimed), or from any other Aeschylean play, when it forms part of
	a song which is presented by the character “Aeschylus” as typically
	Euripidean, and which elsewhere parodies only Euripides!

	Aristophanes, [c dimgray]Frogs[/c] 1287 with scholia

	[b]ΤΗΛΕΦΟΣ[/b]
	[c dimgray]After becoming king of Mysia (see on[/c] Mysians), [c dimgray]Telephus
	was wounded by Achilles when Agamemnon’s army landed
	in his country in the belief that they had arrived near Troy.
	Being told by an oracle that his wounder would also be his
	healer, he went to Argos (or Mycenae), where the army
	was assembled, pleaded for assistance, and was eventually
	healed by the verdigris from Achilles’ spear-point; in
	return he agreed to guide the fleet on its voyage to Troy.
	This story was as old as the cyclic epic, the[/c] Cypria [c dimgray](Arg.
	§7 West), and was famously dramatized by Euripides in
	438 bc.[/c] The most sensational episode in Euripides’ play,
	Telephus’ seizure of the infant Orestes as a hostage, may
	have featured already, in a somewhat different (and less violent)
	form, in Aeschylus’ play; this is stated by a scholiast
	on Aristophanes, Acharnians [c dimgray]332, and Csapo and Preiser[/c]

	[c dimgray]This play seems to have been lost, or at least to have become

	There is only one unequivocal citation of it by any author

	[c dimgray]and by another (Asclepiades) to[/c] Iphigeneia, [c dimgray]was not to be

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The verse is lyric (dactylic). The Aristophanic scholia explicitly

	[b]ΤΟΞΟΤΙΔΕΣ[/b]
	[c dimgray]It is evident from frr. 241 and 244 that the central figure of
	this play was Actaeon (son of Aristaeus and of Autonoe,
	daughter of Cadmus), who was torn to pieces by his own
	hunting dogs when Artemis turned him into a stag for an
	offence against her (or in some versions, against Zeus—see
	below). Since women archers were not a feature either of
	ancient Greek society or (except in the case of Amazons) of
	the ancient Greek imagination, the chorus is likely to have
	consisted of nymphs accompanying Artemis.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]It is possible that the play was part of a tetralogy whose
	other plays dealt with Actaeon’s aunt Semele, her son Dionysus,
	and her other nephew Pentheus; see introductory[/c]

	(fr. 33 Fowler) similarly says that (though without

	he had courted Semele. It is tempting to suppose that
	Aeschylus used this version of the story (and that in frr. 242
	and 243 it is of Semele that Actaeon is primarily thinking);
	in this case the male person who is said in fr. 221 (from[/c]

	of Dionysus, together with their husbands, by boiling
	them”—as in other accounts she had done to Jason and/or
	his father Aeson, and as she had pretended she would do to
	his uncle Pelias. A reference to this story by Ovid (Metamorphoses
	7.294–6) [c dimgray]suggests that Medea did this at the request
	of Dionysus. Rejuvenation—at any rate successful
	rejuvenation—is a theme for satyr-drama, not tragedy; the
	role of Dionysus in the story points the same way, and
	there is virtually no doubt that this play was indeed satyric.
	A vase-painting of about 460 bc[/c] (Ancona, Mus. Naz.
	3198; see e.g. KPS pl. 23a,b) shows on one side a female
	leading an elderly satyr towards a cauldron (exactly as in
	several images in which the woman is Medea and the old
	man Pelias) and on the other side a family scene consisting
	of what seems like the same satyr, now black-haired and
	vigorous, with his wife and a small satyr-child; it could
	very well have been inspired by this play.

	[c dimgray]The “nurses of Dionysus” are in most accounts the
	nymphs of Mount Nysa in Thrace; as Germar and[/c]

	[b]The Nurses of Dionysus[/b]
	[c dimgray]Krumeich (below) point out, nymphs ought to be immortal
	and not need rejuvenation, but perhaps one should not apply
	such logic to a satyr-play. Nor is it clear what Medea is
	doing in this region; perhaps it is after her plot against
	Theseus and her flight from Athens.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]This play certainly has some abnormal features, not
	least the fact that the satyrs, creatures whose sexual desires
	are always intense and nearly always frustrated, are to all
	appearances happily married. It is also rare for a satyrdrama
	to have a secondary chorus, which the “nurses”
	must have been (unless they were silent throughout). And
	in order for the rejuvenation to take effect, both the satyrs
	and the nymphs must at some point have left the scene and
	presently returned with new masks. It is particularly sad,
	therefore, that we have no quotation from the play more
	than three words long, and no papyrus fragments
	identified.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]This may well have been the fourth play of a Dionysiac
	tetralogy; see introductory note to[/c] Wool-Carders.

	[c dimgray]Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles (in that chronological
	order) all dramatized the story of how Philoctetes, who
	had been abandoned on the island of Lemnos by the Greeks
	on their way to Troy, was persuaded, tricked or forced,
	nine years later, into rejoining the expedition, because the
	Greeks had learned that his presence, or at least that of the
	bow and arrows of Heracles which he possessed, was essential
	if Troy was to be captured. Only Sophocles’ play survives
	complete, but we are provided with much information
	about the other two by Dio Chrysostom, whose 52nd[/c]
	Oration [c dimgray]is a comparison of the three plays. Dio notes that
	in comparison with his successors, Aeschylus is sometimes
	a little insouciant about questions of realistic probability.

	Neoptolemus, Aeschylus simply did not allow the issue to
	be raised of whether Philoctetes would have recognized

	chorus of Lemnians without raising the issue of why they
	had done nothing for nine years to help Philoctetes (§§6–7);
	in Euripides the chorus apologize for their neglect,
	while Sophocles cuts the knot by making Lemnos an uninhabited
	island. Philoctetes gave a full narrative of his abandonment
	and subsequent experiences to the chorus (§9),
	doubtless before meeting Odysseus. Odysseus had come to
	Lemnos alone (§14), whereas in Euripides he was accompanied
	by Diomedes, in Sophocles by Neoptolemus; he

	[c dimgray]graceful crime” (§10)—doubtless, like Neoptolemus in
	Sophocles’ play, building a superstructure of falsehood on
	the truthful foundation of the death of Achilles and the suicide
	of Ajax. Despite this, the Aeschylean Odysseus still
	strikes Dio as less dishonest and unheroic than his Euripidean
	and Sophoclean counterparts (§§5, 9), even though,
	like them, he used deception to deprive Philoctetes of the
	bow which was his only means of procuring food (cf. §2);
	on the evidence Dio has provided, Odysseus in Aeschylus

	[c dimgray]We also learn from Aspasius’ commentary on Aristotle’s[/c]

	have been this acute attack of Philoctetes’ malady that provided
	Odysseus (as it provided Neoptolemus in Sophocles’
	play) with an opportunity to take possession of the bow;
	perhaps (as Müller \[see below\] argues \[pp.60–61\], citing
	some later artistic evidence) he grabbed the weapon when
	Philoctetes had hung it up (cf. fr. 251) in order to attend
	to his wound (if so, this is likely to have happened offstage,
	and been narrated subsequently by an indignant
	Philoctetes).We cannot tell how the action then proceeded;
	at the end, of course, Philoctetes will have left the island in
	Odysseus’ company, but we do not know whether he consented
	to do so willingly or reluctantly, nor whether he was

	[b]ΦΟΡΚΙΔΕΣ[/b]
	 The Phorcides (daughters of Phorcys), or Graeae (“old
	women”), were significant secondary figures in the story of
	Perseus and the Gorgon’s head; their most famous characteristic
	was that they had only one eye and one tooth between
	the three of them, so that Perseus by stealing the
	eye and tooth was able to render them helpless. In one common
	version of the myth, presented for example by Aeschylus’
	contemporary Pherecydes (fr. 11 Fowler), he thereby
	forced them to tell him how to find the nymphs (waternymphs
	\[naiads\] according to the inscription on one sixthcentury
	vase painting \[ LIMC [c dimgray]Perseus 88\]) who possessed
	the winged sandals and cap of invisibility that he needed in
	order to get near the Gorgon Medusa, and the bag[/c] (kibisis)
	 in which to put her head. In this account there is a wide
	gap in space and time between the Graeae and the Gorgons
	themselves; Aeschylus, as we learn from \[Eratosthenes\],
	Catasterisms [c dimgray]22 (= Aeschylus fr. 262), closed this
	gap—doubtless for dramatic convenience—by making the
	Graeae “sentinels” to the Gorgons. Perseus seized their eye

	were apparently reported by a third party in what must
	have been a long and elaborate messenger-speech (cf. fr.
	261), presumably to the chorus (which perhaps consisted
	of nymphs of the lake, friendly to Perseus—cf. above).[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]This play is assigned by Aristotle,[/c] Poetics [c dimgray]1456a2–3, to
	the same subcategory of tragedy as[/c] Prometheus [c dimgray]and “all

	has left it uncertain how he defined this category. It

	[b]ΦΡΥΓΕΣ ἢ ΕΚΤΟΡΟΣ ΛΥΤΡΑ[/b]
	[c dimgray]This was the third play of the Achilles trilogy (following[/c]
	Myrmidons [c dimgray]and[/c] Nereids, [c dimgray]qq.v.), and corresponded closely
	to the final book of the[/c] Iliad. [c dimgray]As in[/c] Myrmidons, [c dimgray]the scene
	was Achilles’ hut. The Phrygians of the title had come
	there with Priam (Aristophanes fr. 696), and as a chorus
	they performed some highly distinctive dances[/c] (ibid.); [c dimgray]they
	were perhaps servants rather than Trojan citizens. Before
	their arrival Achilles had had a short dialogue with Hermes
	(who may have been assigned the role which in[/c] Iliad
	[c dimgray]24.120–142 is played by Thetis) and then, again as in[/c] Myrmidons,
	[c dimgray]sat silent and veiled for a long time (scholia to
	Aristophanes,[/c] Frogs [c dimgray]911[/c]; Life of Aeschylus [c dimgray]6). In the[/c] Iliad
	[c dimgray](22.346–354) Achilles had vowed that he would not return
	Hector’s body for burial even if Priam were to offer Hector’s
	weight in gold as a ransom; in Aeschylus, precisely
	this ransom was offered and accepted, being apparently
	literally weighed in scales against Hector’s corpse (scholia
	to[/c] Iliad [c dimgray]22.351; Lycophron,[/c] Alexandra [c dimgray]269–270 with scholia).
	In addition to Achilles, Priam and Hermes, fr. 267 suggests
	(though it does not prove) that there was a fourth[/c]

	the Ransoming of Hector</h2>
	[c dimgray]individual[/c] dramatis persona, [c dimgray]a woman; the scholiast who
	quotes the fragment identifies her as Andromache, Hector’s
	widow, but the text of the fragment itself, stressing as it
	does the fact that this person[/c] comes from the same city [c dimgray]as
	Andromache, suggests rather that it is someone else, most
	likely Briseis. Did she, Achilles’ heterosexual partner, give
	crucial help to Priam in mollifying Achilles, as Achilles’ homosexual
	partner had mollified him in[/c] Myrmidons [c dimgray](and as
	Tecmessa tries in vain to mollify Ajax in Sophocles’[/c] Ajax)?
	[c dimgray]The play will doubtless have included laments over Hector
	by Priam and the chorus, replacing the laments of the
	women in Troy[/c] (Iliad [c dimgray]24.718–776) which the structure of
	Aeschylus’ play did not allow him to include.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]The medieval catalogue of Aeschylus’ plays lists Φρύγες
	and Φρύγιοι as two separate dramas. This is the only
	mention of an Aeschylean title Φρύγιοι, and such a title
	would be contrary to fifth-century usage (Φρύγιος being
	then in use only as an adjective). Either, therefore, the title
	Φρύγιοι is a mere doublet of Φρύγες, or else, as Bothe first[/c]

	with the ransom, asks him whether he is “sending many fine
	goods away to foreigners” for safety, or whether Hector’s death
	has panicked the Trojans into abandoning their city altogether.
	The speaker here is likely to be Hermes too: in view of all we are
	told about Achilles’ long silence, [c dimgray]he[/c] is not likely to have spoken at
	the time when Priam first came into his presence, and before that
	point he would not have been in a position to make a comment like

	[b]ΨΥΧΑΓΩΓΟΙ[/b]
	[c dimgray]This play, as fr. 275 shows, dramatized the Homeric
	Nekyia[/c] (Odyssey [c dimgray]11), and, like it, included a prophecy of
	Odysseus’ death, presumably made by Teiresias; we do not
	know how many of the other characters who appear in the
	Homeric episode (the main ones are the sailor Elpenor,
	Odysseus’ mother Anticleia, Agamemnon, Achilles and a
	silent Ajax) figured in Aeschylus’ play. The scene was a lake
	with a connection to the underworld (frr. 273, 273a); it
	has been identified as Lake Avernus in Campania (cf. Maximus
	of Tyre,[/c] Discourses [c dimgray]8.2b), as the Acherusian lake
	in Thesprotia (cf. Herodotus 5.92η.2), and even as Lake
	Stymphalus in Arcadia (so the medieval scholar Thomas
	Magister, on Aristophanes,[/c] Frogs [c dimgray]1266—but Odysseus, in
	a ship, could never have got there), and the chorus consisted
	of devotees of Hermes living beside the lake and
	operating a necromantic sanctuary there (this perhaps
	slightly favours the Thesprotian location; cf. Alexis fr. 93,[/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]In the [c dimgray]Iliad[/c] Andromache comes not from Lyrnessus but from
	Thebe, and her father’s name is Eëtion ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 6.395–7). Briseis
	does come from Lyrnessus ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 2.689–690, 19.60), but her father’s
	name is Briseus ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 1.392 etc.). Achilles had sacked both
	cities in the same campaign (2.690–3), killing Eëtion and his seven
	sons ([c dimgray]Iliad[/c] 6.416–424); thus there was already in Homer a link between
	the fates of Briseis and Andromache, and Aeschylus makes
	this link closer by making them natives of the same city. We cannot
	tell whether Briseis is here being addressed or only spoken about
	(for example in a speech by Achilles explaining to Priam the chain
	of events that led to Hector’s death).

	from the sixth-century epic known as the [c dimgray]Telegony[/c] or [c dimgray]Thesprotis[/c])
	was that the barb was given by Circe to Telegonus, her son by
	Odysseus, to use as a spear-point, and he killed Odysseus with it
	not knowing him to be his father; but the version we find here is
	given as an alternative by Sextus Empiricus, [c dimgray]Against the Teachers[/c]
	1.267 (though the bird is a seagull rather than a heron). Both are
	ultimately based on Teiresias’ prophecy ([c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 11.134–6) that

	[c dimgray]This play must have been a sequel to[/c] Memnon [c dimgray](q.v.) In it,
	as we learn from Plutarch[/c] (Moralia [c dimgray]17a) and from scholia
	to[/c] Iliad [c dimgray]8.70 and 22.210, Zeus weighed the souls of Achilles
	and Memnon in the scales as they fought each other, and
	the mothers of the two heroes, Thetis and Eos, pleaded
	each on behalf of her son. This weighing of the souls (or
	fates) of Achilles and Memnon appears in art from the sixth
	century onwards (though it is usually Hermes who holds
	the scales), and it doubtless featured in the cyclic epic, the[/c]
	Aethiopis; [c dimgray]it is parodied by Aristophanes in[/c] Frogs [c dimgray]1365–1410.
	A reference by Pollux (4.130) to the weighing scene is
	directly followed by mention of the use of the[/c] mēchanē
	[c dimgray](here called[/c] γέρανος [c dimgray]“crane”) by “Eos snatching up the

	[b]“The Dike Play”[/b]
	[c dimgray]The play from which come the forty-seven lines, or fragments
	of lines, that survive as frr. 281a and 281b is known
	to be Aeschylean by the appearance in 281a.28 of a phrase
	cited elsewhere as by Aeschylus. The main speaker identifies
	herself as Dike (Justice) in 281a.15, and explains how
	she administers the justice of Zeus; by way of example, she
	then speaks of an insane, shameless child of Zeus and Hera,
	who must be Ares the god of war and violence, and whom
	she has presumably encouraged or forced to direct his hostility
	only against unrighteous communities. She is ad-[/c]

	[c dimgray]the awe-inspiring towards the contemptible”, and it is not
	surprising that[/c] Oreithyia [c dimgray]has sometimes been thought to
	have been a satyr-drama; certainly there is nothing in what
	we know of the myth to suggest how Aeschylus could have
	used it to excite tragic emotion, let alone to generate a

	[c dimgray]It is very hard to identify the play from which this fragment
	comes, or even to determine whether it is a tragedy or
	a satyr-drama. Some details of language (ὁτιή, 281a.9;
	ἐρρύθμιξα, 281b.4) suggest satyr-drama; but the words
	of the chorus (if chorus they are) contain no trace of the
	amorality we expect from satyrs. Fraenkel, and many others
	after him, have suggested that the play is[/c] Women of

	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]The papyrus’s marginal variant is surely right:
	φόνος is not a suitable subject either for ἄζοι “dried up (something
	else)” or for ὄζοι “smelt (of something)”.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]The name
	“Ares” was probably explained through a pun on one of the numerous
	similar words in the tragic lexicon, e.g. ἄρος “benefit” (cf.
	Supp. 885) or ἀρείων “better”. Dike will have gone on to explain
	that she taught Ares to end his acts of random violence (34–37)
	and instead attack only those who did not respect justice, leaving
	others in peace (cf. fr. 451n, if it belongs to this play).

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]This metrical fragment is extracted from a sentence of
	Aristides’ which reads in full: “On the contrary, may he not—in
	the words of Aeschylus—either carry a shield next to me or be
	close to me, [c dimgray]who is not a friend to this man[/c] and does not honour
	what it is appropriate to honour.” The italicized clause is somewhat
	poetic in expression (ἐστι “is” is omitted) and can easily be
	modified so as to be metrical; it cannot, however, have directly followed
	“be close to me” in Aeschylus’ text, and Aristides may have
	passed over some words that did not suit his own purposes, e.g.
	δαΐαισιν ἐν μάχαις “in deadly battles”. If the clause “who is not a
	friend to this man” does derive from Aeschylus, “this man” may
	have meant “me” as e.g. in [c dimgray]Ag[/c]. 1438 (where it is “this woman”) and
	Sophocles, [c dimgray]Oedipus the King[/c] 534.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The authors who quote this line (probably from a satyr-drama)

	aid, one would take the line to imply merely that the fish had
	the power to direct its eyes independently of one another; the
	gruesome process of killing them (see on [c dimgray]Pers[/c]. 424–6) would give
	plenty of opportunity for observing this.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]This and the next two fragments, which Athenaeus quotes
	together with it, are probably from the same scene (evidently of a
	satyr-drama). The speaker of this fragment (who seems to envisage
	eating the whole piglet himself) may well be the notoriously
	gluttonous Heracles, in which case this group of fragments would

	789a Kannicht, spoken by Odysseus when on a dangerous mission to Lemnos). The second line quoted by Clement appears to be a
	satirical addition by a comic dramatist: a second character asks
	“And what about someone who’s [c dimgray]unhappy[/c]?” and the first replies
	“He should stay at home as well!” It is impossible to tell whether
	the first line is by Aeschylus (so Clement) or by Sophocles (so
	Stobaeus; it is Sophocles fr. 934 in [c dimgray]TrGF[/c]); they cannot both have
	used it, otherwise Clement, who is discussing plagiarism by Greek
	poets, would certainly have mentioned the fact. This line too has
	sometimes been judged spurious, either the work of a comic dramatist
	or a late forger (most recently by A. Colonna, [c dimgray]Sileno[/c] 17
	\[1991\] 239–241); but it appears to have been parodied by Euripides
	(fr. 894, doubtless from a satyr-play: “he who is truly happy
	eats other people’s food”).

	Probably Aeschylean
	Papyrus Fragments
	[c dimgray]The great majority of surviving Aeschylean papyri were
	written in the second century ad[/c] by one single scribe;
	many of these have been printed above under the plays to
	which they belong, but there are a considerable number
	of other fragments in the same hand (frr. 451c–m Radt)
	whose style either points to or at any rate does not exclude
	an attribution to Aeschylus, but which cannot be confidently
	associated with a specific play. There also survive
	many further fragments (frr. 451n–s Radt), likewise Aeschylean
	in style so far as can be judged, in the hand of the
	scribe who wrote the fragments of the “Dike play” (frr.
	281a–b), and one or two in other hands (frr. 451t–u Radt)
	which are generally ascribed to Aeschylus on reasonable
	grounds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Two of these fragments (frr. 451l and 451k Radt) have
	been ascribed in this edition to specific plays; they appear
	above as frr. 78a (from[/c] Chamber-Makers) [c dimgray]and 180a (from[/c]
	Palamedes) [c dimgray]respectively. Three more (frr. 451h, 451n and
	451q), which meet the criteria for inclusion in this edition
	(preservation of one complete line or two connected half-lines),
	are printed below.[/c]

	[b]Papyrus Fragments[/b]
	[c dimgray]Of most of the remainder there is little that can be said
	with assurance. Fr. 451c comprises 37 lines, most if not all
	of them lyric, whose content appears to have to do largely
	with warfare; at the end (33–37) it seems to be predicted
	that someone who may or may not be described as[/c] courageous
	[c dimgray]will[/c] flee on horseback from an attack [c dimgray]and (but?) that[/c]
	a for\[eign\] soil will receive him. [c dimgray]Fr. 451e refers to someone
	or something[/c] Asian  and several times to musical and other
	sounds; it may well therefore come from a play with strong
	Dionysiac connections, such as one from the Lycurgus or
	the Semele/Pentheus tetralogies. Fr. 451f, which probably
	contains the end of one speech and the beginning of another,
	mentions a bed [c dimgray]or sexual relationship (14) and, just
	previously, that[/c] Hera . . . has come [c dimgray](12–13); it is very
	tempting to associate this with frr. 220a–c and ascribe the
	fragment to[/c] Semele. [c dimgray]In fr. 451g a chorus greets a king, beginning
	with the same words that are used by the Argive elders
	when they greet Agamemnon[/c] (Ag. [c dimgray]783). Fr. 451m consists
	of nearly forty scraps, which are unlikely all to come
	from the same play; one of them mentions[/c] Peleus [c dimgray](1.7), but
	we do not know in what connection. Fr. 451o twice mentions[/c]
	the people of Tenedos [c dimgray](53.3 and 7), and a character
	asks[/c] how is this friendly to ([c dimgray]or[/c] approved by) the \[Ar\]gives?;
	 the only known story which this fits is that of the sacking of
	Tenedos, and the killing of its king Tennes, by the Greek expedition
	on its way to Troy, a story which is told only in
	later sources (e.g. \[Apollodorus\], Epitome [c dimgray]3.23–26) but
	which was the subject of a fifth-century play variously ascribed
	to Euripides and to Critias; this papyrus has thus
	been taken by Mette and others as evidence for an otherwise[/c]

	more than seventy small pieces of papyrus, again probably
	belonging to several different plays; one (55) has been
	thought to coincide with a book-fragment of[/c] Myrmidons

	[c dimgray]A chorus of women lament the ruin of a man who had been noted
	for his hospitality and justice, and had apparently suffered as a result
	of these qualities. (It is clear that at least one death has occurred,
	but we cannot tell whether the victim is the hospitable man
	himself, or one or more members of his family, or both.) Perhaps
	the play was[/c] Cretan Women, [c dimgray]and the hospitable man was Minos
	who had lost his young son Glaucus (on Minos’ reputation for justice,
	cf.[/c] Odyssey [c dimgray]11.568–571 and Plato[/c], Apology [c dimgray]41a). Polyidus,
	the seer who discovered Glaucus’ body and later restored him to
	life, was a stranger in Crete (he was a Corinthian: see[/c] Iliad [c dimgray]13.663
	and Pindar,[/c] Olympian [c dimgray]13.74–75), and in the play he may well
	have arrived there only shortly before the disappearance of
	Glaucus—and been blamed for it, and then for the boy’s death.
	Such a scenario would help to explain Minos’ demand—which
	looks as though it were designed to be an impossible one—that he
	should bring Glaucus back to life (or else forfeit his own?)[/c]
