PINDAR, Olympian Odes

		[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	“Of the nine Greek lyric poets Pindar is by far the greatest
	for the magnificence of his inspiration, his precepts, figures
	of language, lavish abundance of matter and words,
	and river (so to speak) of eloquence.” This assessment by
	Quintilian in his survey of Greek poets ([c dimgray]Inst. Or[/c]. 10.1.61)
	was the standard evaluation of Pindar in antiquity and
	helps to explain why nearly one fourth of his odes are well
	preserved in manuscripts, whereas the works of the other
	lyric poets have survived only in bits and pieces.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ancient editors divided Pindar’s poems into seventeen
	books (papyrus rolls) by genres: 1 book of hymns
	to various gods; 1 of paeans (hymns addressed mainly to
	Apollo); 2 of dithyrambs (hymns addressed mainly to
	Dionysus); 2 of prosodia (hymns for approaching a god’s
	shrine); 3 of partheneia (hymns sung by maidens); 2 of
	hyporchemata (dancing hymns); 1 of encomia (songs in
	praise of men at banquets); 1 of threnoi (songs of lament);
	and 4 of epinicia (victory songs). Although numerous fragments
	of his paeans and other poems have survived on
	papyrus or through quotation by ancient authors, only the
	four books of epinicia, comprising forty-five odes in celebration
	of athletic victors, have been preserved almost
	intact in a continuous manuscript tradition, and it is upon

	them that his reputation has largely rested as Greece’s
	greatest poet of praise.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The victory odes are, however, notoriously difficult to
	understand. They are complex mixtures of praise (and
	blame), mythical narratives, prayers and hymns, advice,
	athletic triumphs (and failures), and even current events,
	conveyed in a highly artificial language in often very complicated
	poetic meters, all designed to be sung and danced
	to the accompaniment of lyres and pipes. They represent
	the apex of their genre, in much the same way that Bach’s
	works are a culmination of baroque music. Pindar’s art,
	like Bach’s, presents a constant tension between the constraints
	of form and the freedom of innovation; it too exhibits
	tremendous energy, great variety within its genres,
	and reveals ever-new depths upon repeated hearings.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Our understanding of Pindar’s odes has been complicated
	by what Hugh Lloyd-Jones has called a “fatal
	conjunction of nineteenth-century historicism with nineteenth-
	century Romanticism.”
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] The former, already employed
	by ancient commentators, seeks to explain details
	in the odes as reflections of historical (and all too often
	pseudo-historical) events. The latter interprets the poems
	as expressions of the poet’s personal opinions and subjective
	feelings. There is no doubt that the odes refer to historical
	persons and events (indeed every ode has an actual

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Lloyd-Jones, “Pindar,” [c dimgray]Proceedings of the British Academy[/c]
	68 (1982) 145; the entire address provides an excellent assessment
	of Pindar’s qualities. For a good, brief overview of trends in
	Pindaric scholarship, see the same author’s “Modern Interpretation
	of Pindar: The Second Pythian and Seventh Nemean Odes,”

	victory as its occasion) and that Pindar presents a distinctive
	personality, but these aspects of the poems are subsidiary
	to their generic function of praising men within the
	religious and ethical norms of aristocratic fifth-century
	Greece. In E. L. Bundy’s formulation, they constitute “an
	oral, public, epideictic literature dedicated to the single
	purpose of eulogizing men and communities.”
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar’s poetry expresses the conservative, so-called
	“archaic,” mores of the sixth and early fifth century. His
	thought is ethically cautionary and contains frequent reminders
	of man’s limitations, his dependence on the gods
	and nature, and the brevity of life’s joys. He espouses moderation
	(μέτρον, καιρός), the aristocratic (“Doric”) values
	of civic order (εὐνομία) and peaceful concord (ἡσυχία),
	and reverence for the gods (εὐσέβεια).
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] His gaze is primarily
	backwards toward the models of the past, as they
	are exemplified in the legends from Hellenic myth, and it
	is against these that the victors’ achievements are measured.
	To help guide the reader, I provide some key terms
	that point to recurring themes in the epinicia.

	[c dimgray]Pindar’s Life and Career[/c]
	What little we know about Pindar comes from the
	poems themselves and from five brief accounts of his life.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]
	Although they contain much fanciful material and numerous
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]A brief life preserved on a papyrus dating from about 200
	a.d. (P. Oxy. 2438) was first published in 1961. The other sources
	are the [c dimgray]Vita Ambrosiana[/c] (preserved in the Ambrosian MS), [c dimgray]Vita
	Thomana[/c] (attributed to Thomas Magister), [c dimgray]Vita Metrica[/c] (31 hexameters
	perhaps composed in the 4th or 5th cent. a.d.), and the
	notice in the [c dimgray]Suda.[/c] Sections 25–33 in Eustathius’ [c dimgray]Praefatio[/c] rely
	heavily on the other lives and provide little new information. The
	texts of the vitae in the MSS and Eustathius’ [c dimgray]Praefatio[/c] can be
	found in A. B. Drachmann, [c dimgray]Scholia Vetera in Pindari Carmina[/c]
	(Leipzig 1903,1927) 1.1–9 and 3.296–303. For a translation of the
	[c dimgray]Vita Ambrosiana[/c], see M. R. Lefkowitz, [c dimgray]The Lives of the Greek
	Poets[/c] (Baltimore 2012) 145–147; for a text and translation of the
	papyrus life, see I. Gallo, [c dimgray]Una nuova biografia di Pindaro[/c] (POxy.
	2438). [c dimgray]Introduzione, testo critico e commentario[/c] (Salerno 1968).

	[c dimgray]Page number 4[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	contradictions, one can, by careful sifting, arrive at
	the following probable information. Pindar was born in
	Cynoscephalae, a village on the outskirts of Thebes (the
	chief city in Boeotia). His father was probably Daïphantus
	and his mother Cleodice. If a first-person statement in
	one poem ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 5) refers to the poet himself, Pindar belonged
	to the clan of the Aegeidae, prominent in Thebes
	and Sparta. If the quotation in the [c dimgray]Vita Ambrosiana[/c] indicating
	that Pindar was born during a Pythian festival ([c dimgray]fr[/c].
	193) is combined with the statement in the [c dimgray]Suda[/c] that he
	was born in the 65th Olympiad (520–516 b.c.), the most
	likely date for his birth becomes 518. He studied pipe-playing
	with Scopelinus (perhaps his uncle), choral direction
	in Athens with Apollodorus (or Agathocles), and possibly
	music with Lasus of Hermione. The earliest victory
	ode for which dates are given in the ancient sources is
	[c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 10, composed in 498 when Pindar would have been
	about twenty. The papyrus life reports that he won the
	dithyrambic contest in Athens in the following year (497/
	6), and if the scholiastic date of 446 is correct for [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 8, it
	is the latest extant epinicion. We can be confident, however,
	that Pindar was composing until at least 452, the date
	of [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 4, confirmed by both the papyrus life and a papyrus
	victory list.
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] Since the life span of 80 years given in the [c dimgray]Vita
	Metrica[/c] is the only one long enough to encompass the
	dated odes (the other lives give 55 and 66), his death can
	arbitrarily be put at 438.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A number of anecdotes preserved in ancient sources,
	although of little or no historical value, serve to illustrate

PINDAR, Olympian Odes
	[c darkmagenta][b]PINDAR, Olympian Odes[/b][/c]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	aspects of Pindar’s career and poetic art. Two reported
	in the [c dimgray]Vita Ambrosiana[/c] point to his poetic precociousness.
	One, attributed to the early Hellenistic biographer
	Chamaeleon, tells that when Pindar was a boy hunting
	near Helicon, he fell asleep and a bee built a honeycomb
	on his mouth. While the honey points to the sweetness of
	his song (cf. [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 11.4 and [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 3.64), the site of Helicon
	links Pindar with his Boeotian predecessor Hesiod (c. 750
	b.c.), who received his poetic commission while shepherding
	sheep at the foot of that mountain. The other relates
	that when his Athenian instructor Apollodorus had to be
	out of town and turned over the training of a chorus to the
	young Pindar, he did so well that he became immediately
	famous. Plutarch informs us that the Boeotian poet
	Corinna criticized the young Pindar for priding himself on
	stylistic embellishments rather than on mythical topics.
	He then composed the hymn that begins, “Shall it be
	Ismenus, or Melia of the golden spindle, or Cadmus . . .
	that we shall hymn?” ([c dimgray]fr[/c]. 29). When he showed it to her, she
	laughed and said, “One should sow with the hand, not the
	whole sack.”
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] The story illustrates Pindar’s generous use of
	mythical catalogs, especially to introduce poems (cf. [c dimgray]Nem[/c].
	10 and [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 7), and the frequent references to myths and
	legends throughout his works.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Three anecdotes in the [c dimgray]Vita Ambrosiana[/c] point to Pindar’s
	close relationship with the gods. We are told that Pan
	was once heard singing one of Pindar’s paeans between the
	two Boeotian mountains of Cithaeron and Helicon, and
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]Plut. [c dimgray]de glor. Ath[/c]. 4.347F–348A. Corinna may, however, actually
	belong to the 3rd cent. b.c.; see M. West, “Dating Corinna,”
	[c dimgray]Classical Quarterly[/c] 84 (1990) 553–557.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 6[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	that in a dream Demeter blamed him for neglecting her in
	his hymns, whereupon he composed a poem in her honor.
	It is also reported that the priest at Apollo’s temple in
	Delphi announced upon closing each day, “Let the poet
	Pindar join the god at supper.” The 2nd century a.d. traveler
	Pausanias claims to have seen the iron chair at Delphi
	upon which Pindar sat to sing his poems to Apollo
	(10.24.5). All these anecdotes reflect the deeply religious
	nature of his poetry and his special devotion to Apollo, who
	figures so prominently in his works.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Finally, there is the famous story of Pindar’s house being
	spared when Alexander the Great razed Thebes in 335
	b.c.,
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] familiar to English readers from Milton’s lines in
	Sonnet 8: “The great Emathian conquerer bid spare | The
	house of Pindarus, when temple and tow’r | Went to the
	ground.” Although some have rightly questioned the historical
	validity of the story,
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] it serves to illustrate the Panhellenic
	reputation Pindar enjoyed in the century following
	his death.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The most important historical event during Pindar’s career
	was the Persian invasion under Xerxes that culminated
	in two decisive battles, one at sea near Salamis in 480
	and the other on land at Plataea in 479. There are three
	references in the epinicia to these Greek victories. In [c dimgray]Pyth.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c]The story is mentioned in numerous places besides the lives
	and the [c dimgray]Suda[/c]: Plutarch, [c dimgray]Alexander[/c] 11; Arrian, [c dimgray]History of Alexander[/c]
	1.9.10; Pliny, [c dimgray]Natural History[/c] 7.29; and Dio Chrysostom 2.33.
	Some sources mention a previous sparing by the Lacedaemonians.

PINDAR, Olympian Odes
	[c darkmagenta][b]PINDAR, Olympian Odes[/b][/c]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	1 Pindar mentions the Athenian and Spartan pride in the
	battles of Salamis and Plataea, in [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 5 he praises the
	Aeginetan sailors for the part they played at Salamis, and in
	[c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 8 he expresses his relief at being free from the Persian
	threat, which he calls the “rock of Tantalus, that unbearable
	labor for Hellas.” His own city of Thebes had unfortunately
	sided with the invaders and actually fought against
	the Athenians at the battle of Plataea. We have no way of
	knowing Pindar’s private reaction to his city’s policy, but he
	publicly lauded the victors, even going so far as to call Athens
	the “bulwark of Hellas” ([c dimgray]fr.[/c] 76) for her part in the war
	effort.
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] The story in the [c dimgray]Vita Thomana[/c] that tells of his being
	fined by his own city for praising Athens reflects what
	must have been a sensitive issue for him, but the evidence
	of his poetry shows that he remained a Panhellenic poet,
	consistent with his wish at the end of [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1 to be “foremost
	in wisdom among Hellenes everywhere.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While the mainland Greeks were confronting the Persians,
	the Greeks in Sicily were facing a Carthaginian
	threat. In 480 Gelon of Syracuse (whose younger brother
	Hieron succeeded him two years later as tyrant of Syracuse)
	joined forces with Theron of Acragas to defeat a
	Carthaginian army numbering 100,000 at the battle of
	Himera, spoils from which greatly enriched both cities. At
	[c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1.75–80 Pindar ranks this battle on the same level as
	Salamis and Plataea.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The 76th Olympiad in 476, the first following these
	three great battles, marks a high point in Pindar’s career as
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]In [c dimgray]fr[/c]. 77 he also praised the Athenians for their naval action
	at Artemisium earlier in 480, where they “laid the bright foundation
	of freedom.”

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	an epinician poet. Five of the fourteen Olympian odes are
	to victors in that Olympiad, including two of his major poems,
	[c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1 to Hieron of Syracuse (whose horse Pherenicus
	won the single-horse race) and [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2 to Theron of Acragas
	(who won the chariot race). In 476/5 Hieron founded the
	city of Aetna and in 474 his ships defeated an Etruscan
	fleet at Cyme near the Bay of Naples. The poets who enjoyed
	his patronage included Aeschylus, who wrote the
	Aetnaeae ([c dimgray]Women of Aetna[/c]) to celebrate the founding of
	that city, Simonides, Bacchylides, who wrote three
	epinicia (3, 4, 5) and an encomium ([c dimgray]fr[/c]. 20C) for him, and,
	of course, Pindar, who honored him with [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1, [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1, 2,
	3, a hyporchema ([c dimgray]fr[/c]. 105), and an encomium ([c dimgray]fr[/c]. 124d). In
	[c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1 Pindar compares Hieron to Philoctetes and praises
	him for his victory at Cyme, in which he “delivered Hellas
	from grievous slavery.” In [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 2 he mentions the gratitude
	of the Western Locrians for Hieron’s deliverance of
	them from war; the scholia claim that Hieron intervened to
	stop Anaxilas of Rhegium (d. 476) from attacking Locri
	(probably in 477), but the date and circumstances of the
	poem remain uncertain. In addition, Pindar wrote odes for
	Theron’s brother Xenocrates and nephew Thrasybulus
	([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 6 and [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 2), for Hieron’s general, Chromius ([c dimgray]Nem[/c].
	1 and 9), and for his fellow Syracusan, Hagesias ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The geographical dispersion of the victors celebrated
	by Pindar indicates how broadly his reputation and associations
	had spread. Of the 45 odes, only five are to Thebans.
	Seventeen are for victors from cities in Sicily and southern
	Italy (Syracuse, Acragas, Camarina, Himera, andWestern
	Locri), eleven for victors from the island of Aegina (the
	most by far for a single city), seven for victors from cities on
	mainland Greece (Corinth, Opus, Orchomenus, Pelinna,

	Athens, Acharnae, and Argos), three for victors from
	Cyrene on the coast of north Africa, and one each for
	victors from the islands of Rhodes and Tenedos. Victors
	mentioned in the epinician fragments are from Rhodes,
	Aegina, and Megara; paeans are composed for the people
	of Thebes, Abdera, Ceos, Delphi, Naxos, Aegina, and
	Argos; dithyrambs for Argos, Thebes, and Athens; and encomia
	for individuals from Acragas, Macedonia, Corinth,
	Tenedos, and Syracuse.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Other than anecdotal comments in the scholia, we have
	no details about how contracts were arranged,
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] whether
	Pindar was present at the athletic contests (although at [c dimgray]Ol[/c].
	10.100 he says that he saw the victor win at Olympia), or
	whether he oversaw any of the performances (at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6.88,
	however, he addresses one Aeneas, identified by the
	scholia as the chorus trainer). Even when there is a statement
	in an ode such as “I have come,” it is not always certain
	that this is meant literally. For example, [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 3 opens
	as if the poet were present at the celebration, but at line 77
	he says, “I am sending” (πέμπω) the song. At [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 2.4–5
	the poet says, “I come bearing the song” (φέρων μέλος
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]The scholia provide two fanciful attempts to explain the
	opening of an ode in terms of contractual arrangements. Inscr. a to
	[c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1 reports: “According to the historian Artemon, Pindar begins
	with ‘golden lyre’ because Hieron had promised him a golden
	cithara.” Schol. 1a on [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 5 recounts: “They say that Pytheas’ relatives
	approached Pindar to write an epinicion for him, but when
	he asked for three thousand drachmas, they said that for the same
	price it was better to have a statue made; later they changed their
	minds and paid the sum; to chide them he began with ‘I am not a
	sculptor.’”

	[c dimgray]Page number 10[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	ἔρχομαι), while at line 68 he says, “the song is being sent”
	(μέλος πέμπεται).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The dating of most of the Olympian and many Pythian
	odes is relatively sound, thanks to the discovery of the
	Oxyrhynchus list of Olympic victors (P. Oxy. 222) and to
	the fact that Aristotle had compiled a list of Pythian victors
	upon which the ancient commentators drew.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] The dates
	of the Nemeans and Isthmians are another matter. Occasionally
	there is a clear historical reference in the poem
	(e.g., the allusion to the battle of Salamis in [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 5), but the
	dates given in the manuscripts are often inaccurate or contradictory.
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray]The Epinician Genre and Greek Athletics[/c]
	The brief but brilliant flowering of epinician poetry
	spans the careers of three poets. Simonides began the
	practice of composing elaborate odes in honor of athletic
	victors in the generation before Pindar, while Bacchylides,
	Simonides’ nephew, appears to have continued writing
	epinicia somewhat later. The three poets moved in the
	same circles and praised the same men. Simonides’ most
	famous patrons were Thessalian nobility, for one of whose

	([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 10). Like Pindar, Simonides wrote an ode for Xenocrates
	of Acragas ([c dimgray]fr[/c]. 513 Campbell), while Bacchylides
	composed odes for Hieron (3, 4, 5) and Pytheas of Aegina
	(13). Although a few victory odes from the later fifth century
	are mentioned, by 440 the genre seems to have been
	moribund.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The apex of dozens of athletic contests throughout the
	Greek world were the four major Panhellenic festivals established
	at Olympia (776), Delphi (582), the Isthmus (c.
	581), and Nemea (c. 573). They were called crown games
	because the victors received crowns of wild olive, laurel,
	dry parsley (or pine), and green parsley, respectively.
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] The
	Olympic and Pythian games (the latter held at Delphi)
	were celebrated every four years, the Isthmian and
	Nemean every two, all staggered so as to produce a continuous
	succession of contests. Thus the 76th Olympiad
	would have included the following crown games: 476,
	Olympic (August); 475, Nemean (July); 474, Isthmian
	(April), Pythian (August); 473, Nemean (July); 472, Isthmian
	(April). The 77th Olympiad then began in August
	472.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	During Pindar’s time the non-equestrian events at
	Olympia consisted of the stadion (200 meter race), diaulos
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c]The prizes awarded at lesser games included silver cups at
	Sicyon and Marathon, bronze shields at Argos, woolen coats at
	Pellana, and prizes of money, bulls, and olive oil at the Panathenaic
	games. According to the calculations of D. C. Young, [c dimgray]The
	Olympic Myth of Greek Amateur Athletics[/c] (Chicago 1984) 115–
	127, the prizes at the Panathenaea would have been very valuable
	in purely monetary terms. In addition, home towns awarded victorious
	athletes money, free meals, and other honors.

	(one-lap 400 meter race), dolichos (4,800 meter race),
	hoplites dromos (400 meter race in armor), pentathlon
	(consisting of stadion, discus throw, javelin throw, long
	jump, and wrestling), wrestling, boxing, pancratium (combination
	of wrestling and boxing), and boys’ stadion, wrestling,
	and boxing. The equestrian events were the mule car
	race ([c dimgray]apene[/c]), bareback single-horse race ([c dimgray]keles[/c]), and fourhorse
	chariot race ([c dimgray]tethrippon[/c]). P. Oxy. 222 lists the following
	winners for the 76th Olympiad:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	\[76th. Sca\]mandrus of Mitylene, stadion
	\[Da\]ndis of Argos, diaulos
	\[ . . . . . . . \]of Sparta, dolichos
	\[ . . . . . . . . \] of Taras, pentathlon
	\[ . . . . . . of Ma\]roneia, wrestling
	\[Euthymus of Loc\]ri in Italy, boxing
	\[Theagenes of Th\]asos, pancratium
	\[ . . . . . . . . \] of Sparta, boys’ stadion
	\[Theognetus of Aegi\]na, boys’ wrestling
	\[Hag\]esi\[da\]mus of Locri in Italy, boys’ boxing
	\[Ast\]ylus of Syracuse, hoplites
	\[Ther\]on of Acragas, owner, tethrippon
	\[Hier\]on of Syracuse, owner, keles
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The list omits the mule car race, perhaps because it was included
	in the Olympic program for some fifty years only (c.
	500–444) and was of inferior status (cf. Paus. 5.9.1–2).
	Naturally, great men like Hieron and Theron hired jockeys
	and drivers to do the actual driving that won them their
	victories. Only one victor is praised for driving his own
	chariot, Herodotus of Thebes ([c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 1). Three drivers are
	mentioned by name: Phintis, Hagesias’ mule car driver
	([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6), Nicomachus, Xenocrates’ charioteer ([c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 2), and

	Carrhotus, Arcesilas’ charioteer ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 5). The chariot
	races consisted of twelve laps around the hippodrome (cf.
	[c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2.50, 3.33, and [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 5.33).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Whereas the Olympic games had only divisions of men
	and boys in certain events, the Nemean and Isthmian
	games had a third, intermediate category for youths.
	Trainers played an important role in the formation of
	young athletes and four are mentioned in the epinicia:
	Melesias ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 8, [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 4 and 6), Menander ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 5), Ilas
	([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 10), and Orseas ([c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 4). The victory of Alcimedon
	in the boys’ wrestling at Olympia ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 8) was the thirtieth
	won by the trainees of Melesias, who had himself been a
	victorious pancratiast at Nemea. Many families and clans
	were devoted to athletic competitions, and some dominated
	certain events. Three sons and two grandsons of the
	boxer Diagoras of Rhodes, celebrated in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 7, won Olympic
	crowns. Alcimidas of Aegina won his clan’s twenty-fifth
	crown victory ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 6), while the clan of Xenophon of
	Corinth boasted a total of sixty Nemean and Isthmian victories
	([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 13).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Clear notions of the music, dance, and performance
	of the victory odes were already lost by the time of the
	scholia; what little we know about their performance must
	be inferred from internal evidence. Pindar speaks of his
	odes as hymns (ὕμνοι), revels (κῶμοι), and songs (ἀοιδαί,
	μέλη); he mentions accompaniment by lyres (φόρμιγγες,
	λύραι) and pipes (αὐλοί); he occasionally refers to the
	celebrants as men (ἄνδρες), young men (νέοι), or boys
	(παῖδες). The relationship between the revel and the actual
	performance of the ode is not clear, and there has
	been considerable controversy over whether the epinicia
	were sung by a chorus or by a soloist. The fact that Pindar
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 14[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	never refers directly to the performance of his epinicia by a
	chorus (χορός) has led some scholars to question whether
	a chorus performed them at all. The evidence for choral or
	solo performance is not conclusive either way,
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] but given
	the fact that other Pindaric genres such as paeans, dithyrambs,
	partheneia, and hyporchemata were performed by
	choruses and that the formal features of the epinicia are
	similar to those of tragic choruses, it seems probable that
	at least some of the epinicia were performed by a choir that
	sang in unison and danced to the accompaniment of lyres
	or [c dimgray]auloi[/c] or both combined. Late sources say that choruses
	danced the strophe (“turn”) in one direction, reversed the
	steps for the antistrophe (“counterturn”), and stood in
	place for the epode (“after song”), but even that must remain
	a conjecture.
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The location of the performance is often indicated by
	the deictic article ὅδε “this” and is usually at the hometown
	of the victor (e.g., “this island” at [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 3.68 and 6.46). It is
	often claimed that shorter epinicia (e.g., [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 11 and [c dimgray]Pyth.[/c]
	7) were improvisations performed at the site of the victory
	and that monostrophic odes (e.g., [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 6 and [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 2) were
	processional, but there is no conclusive evidence for such
	assumptions.

	[b]Introduction[/b]

	[c dimgray]Elements of the Epinicia[/c]
	In generic terms, the epinicia are occasional poems
	that invoke shared social values to praise victors and offer
	them immortality in verse. For this task there is no set prescription,
	and each ode is a unique blend of praise, myth,
	and argumentation. Certain elements, however, are bound
	to recur, and a fundamental understanding of any ode
	must begin with them.
	An epigram attributed to Simonides succinctly sets
	forth the basic facts of an athletic victory ([c dimgray]A.P[/c]. 16.23):
	[m1]\ [/m]

	εἶπον, τίς, τίνος ἐσςί, τίνος πατρίδος, τί δ’
	ἐνίκης.
	Κασμύλος, Εὐαγόρου, Πύθια πύξ, Ῥόδιος.
	Tell your name, your father’s, your city, your victory.
	Casmylus, son of Euagoras, boxing at the Pythia,
	Rhodes.
	These elements, three identifying the victor (name, father,
	city) and two the victory (games, event), are, with the occasional
	exception of the patronymic, normally given in each
	epinicion; they ultimately derive from the herald’s proclamation
	at the games and were preserved on papyrus and in
	stone inscriptions.

	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c]An inscription from the first half of the 4th cent. b.c. from
	Ioulis on Ceos (IG XII 5.608) which lists Ceans who won victories
	at the Panhellenic games is quoted and discussed by
	H. Maehler, [c dimgray]Die Lieder des Bakchylides II[/c] (Leiden 1982) 1–3.
	For a detailed treatment of verse inscriptions for athletes, see
	J. Ebert, [c dimgray]Griechische Epigramme auf Sieger an gymnischen und
	hippischen Agonen[/c] (Berlin 1972).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 16[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	Pindar shows great ingenuity in incorporating such
	facts into his grand-style verse. One way is to vary the timing
	and placement of the information. In [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 9, for example,
	all the facts of victory (except the father’s name, which
	comes at 71) are provided in the first sentence, which reserves
	the name of the city until the last word, thus forming
	a bridge to the narrative. In [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 11 the information comes
	in the middle of the ode (lines 11–15) and concludes with
	the city, whose people are then praised in the final lines of
	the poem. [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 13 reserves the event for emphatic last place
	(at line 30) because Xenophon had achieved an unprecedented
	double victory in the stadion and pentathlon.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Another means of varying the presentation of the basic
	information is by allusive references. In [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 9 the victor
	is called “bronze-shielded” (1), indicating that he won the
	race in armor. In [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 12 only the word “feet” (15) alludes to
	the fact that the victor was a runner. Pindar uses many circumlocutions
	for places, especially game sites. References
	to the Olympic games are made in terms of: Pisa (the town
	nearest Olympia), Alpheus (the river at Olympia), the hill
	of Cronus (the adjacent hill), or such phrases as “Zeus’
	greatest games.” The Pythian games are signified by the
	mention of Delphi or Pytho (the site), Crisa or Cirrha
	(nearby towns), Parnassus (the adjacent mountain),
	Castalia (the spring), the “navel of the earth,” or the
	“games of Apollo.” The “valley of the lion” invokes Nemea
	(where Heracles slew the Nemean lion), and “the bridge at
	Corinth” denotes the Isthmus. Alternatively, the mention
	of the patron god or the type of crown won may indicate
	the place of victory.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar often refers to his poems as hymns, and there is
	not a single ode without some reference to divinity. Both

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	hymns and prayers underscore the essentially religious nature
	of the athletic contests and of the celebrations associated
	with them. Pindar draws upon a long tradition of
	hymns and masterfully adapts both cultic and rhapsodic elements
	to his poems.
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c] Some begin with elaborate hymns
	to various minor gods: Olympia ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 8), Fortune ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 12),
	the Graces ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 14), Peace ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 8), Eleithyia ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 7),
	Hora ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 8), Theia ([c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 5), and Thebe ([c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 7). Although
	the major Olympian gods are continually mentioned,
	there is, surprisingly, no opening hymn to any of
	them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Prayers abound in the odes, and their function is invariably
	transitional: they conclude a topic, introduce a new
	one, or pass from one to another. The poet often prays for
	continued blessings for the athlete and his city or asks for
	assistance in his task of praising adequately. Many prayers
	are expressed negatively, asking that something bad may
	not happen, especially in the wake of the present success.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar also draws upon the earlier didactic tradition,
	represented by Hesiod, Theognis, Phocylides, and a collection
	of the “Sayings of Chiron.” A hallmark of epinician
	style is its frequent use of maxims, which are often among
	Pindar’s most memorable verses.
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] Examples include
	“great risk does not take hold of a cowardly man” ([c dimgray]Ol[/c].
	1.81), “wise is he who knows many things by nature” ([c dimgray]Ol[/c].
	2.86), “trial is the test of mortals” ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 4.18), “about the
	minds of humans hang numberless errors” ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 7.24–25),

	“one cannot conceal the character that is inborn” ([c dimgray]Ol[/c].
	13.13), “even wisdom is enthralled to gain” ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 3.54),
	and “the word lives longer than deeds” ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 4.6).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar’s debt to the epic tradition represented by
	Homer, Hesiod, and the Homeric Hymns is most apparent
	in his narratives, loosely called “myths,” which are taken
	from the great store of Hellenic legend. He normally selects
	an episode from a larger story, which he elaborates
	with striking details. Often the narratives concern heroes
	connected with the victor’s city, like those telling of the
	birth and colonization of Rhodes in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 7, the origins of
	Opus and its heroes in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 9, and Corinthian heroes in [c dimgray]Ol[/c].
	13. Sometimes the narrative tells about an ancestor of
	the victor (Iamus in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6 and Alexidamus in [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 9). Eight
	of the eleven odes to Aeginetans relate episodes from the
	sagas of Aeacus and his descendants, heroes closely associated
	with that island. Heracles is a frequent subject, especially
	in his role as founder of the Olympic festival ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 3
	and 10) and as exemplar of one who has reached the limits
	of human success ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 3); his whole life from infancy to
	apotheosis is briefly sketched in [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 1. At times a short
	narrative makes a specific point: Erginus succeeds in spite
	of his appearance ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 4); Philoctetes’ situation resembles
	that of Hieron ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1); Antilochus, in dying to save his father,
	is a model of filial piety ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 6); and Ajax receives
	posthumous fame after disgrace ([c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 4). Occasionally narratives
	depict examples of behavior to be avoided: Tantalus
	([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1), Ixion ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 2), Coronis and Asclepius ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 3),
	Clytaemestra ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 11), and Bellerophon ([c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 7).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Especially memorable scenes or tableaux in the narratives
	include Pelops praying to Poseidon for assistance in
	defeating Oenomaus ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1), the birth of Iamus in a thicket

	eruptions from beneath Mt. Aetna ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1), Apollo’s love

	and the quarrel of Zeus and Poseidon over marrying Thetis
	([c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 8). By far the most complex and extensive narrative
	(of almost two hundred verses) is the depiction of Jason’s
	career in [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Many myths are demarcated by ring composition, a
	technique common in epic.
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] By means of a summary
	statement (κεφάλαιον) or brief allusion (often in relative
	or temporal clauses) the poet sketches the coming narrative.
	He then takes up the topics in greater detail, usually
	in reverse chronological order. After retracing his steps to
	the initial point, often with echoing vocabulary, he may
	add an epilogue. For example, in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1.24–27 Pindar
	briefly mentions Pelops, Poseidon’s love for him, his being
	taken from a cauldron, and his ivory shoulder. In lines 37–
	87 he gives his own version of Tantalus’ feast and relates at
	greater length Poseidon’s love for Pelops, which culminates
	in his helping Pelops win Hippodameia. A brief epilogue
	(88–96) tells of Pelops’ success and glorification at
	Olympia. The beginning of [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 3 offers a more elaborate
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]The pioneering work on ring composition in Pindar is by L.
	Illig, [c dimgray]Zur Form der pindarischen Erzählung[/c] (Berlin 1932) 55–67,
	who cites the story of Niobe at [c dimgray]Il[/c]. 24.601–619 as a model.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 20[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	example of ring composition. In lines 1–11 the poet makes
	the following points: he wishes Chiron were still alive;
	it was Chiron who raised Asclepius to be a doctor;
	Asclepius’ mother Coronis died before he was born. After
	relating the stories of Coronis’ love affair and death (12–
	42) and Asclepius’ career as a doctor (43–58), he returns to
	his wish that Chiron were still alive (63–67). Other examples
	include [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 3.13–34 (Heracles’ bringing the olive tree
	to Olympia); [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 7.27–80 (history of Rhodes); [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 13.63–90
	(story of Bellerophon); [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 6.28–42 (Antilochus’ rescue
	of his father); [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 9.5–69 (story of Cyrene); [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 10.31–
	48 (Perseus’ visit to the Hyperboreans); [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 11.17–37
	(Orestes’ revenge on his father’s murderers); [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 12.6–
	24 (Athena’s invention of the pipe); and [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 10.55–90
	(Polydeuces’ decision to share his immortality with his
	brother Castor).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Most narratives occur in the middle of their odes between
	initial and concluding treatments of the occasion
	(ABA structure). No ode opens immediately with a mythical
	narrative, but in two striking cases ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 1 and 10) the
	myths begin in the middle and continue to the very end,
	while [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 9 concludes with an additional narrative about
	an ancestor of the victor. The transition to the myth is
	sometimes elaborately executed, but often it is effected,
	with varying degrees of abruptness, by a relative pronoun
	or adverb, as in the Homeric Hymns.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Catalogs are common in archaic poetry, whether as lists
	of epithets or places in hymns, contingents in the [c dimgray]Iliad[/c], or
	women in Hesiod’s [c dimgray]Ehoiai[/c]. Lists of victories (e.g., [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 7.80–
	87), heroes (e.g., [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4.171–183), places (e.g., [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 9.67–
	68), legendary exploits (e.g., [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 10.4–18), and virtuous
	attributes (e.g., [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 6.45–54) abound in the odes. Pindar

	skillfully adapts them to his complex meters and varies

	Another distinctive aspect of Pindar’s composition is
	the sudden, sometimes startling, curtailment or outright
	rejection of a topic. Often labeled [c dimgray]Abbruchsformeln[/c] or
	[c dimgray]recusationes[/c], such interjections by the poet give a sense of
	spontaneity, as if allowing us to witness him in the process
	of deciding which topic to treat or how to treat it. Often he
	provides justifications for his decision, thus giving such
	passages an apologetic tone. Examples of break-offs from
	and rejections of narratives include [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1.28–35 (rejection
	of the popular story of Tantalus’ feast), [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 9.35–41 (rejection
	of Heracles’ battles against gods as an unsuitable
	theme), [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 13.91–92 (refusal to treat Bellerophon’s
	death), [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4.247–248 (abridgment of the narrative), [c dimgray]Pyth[/c].
	10.48–54 (curtailment of Perseus’ deeds), [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 11.38–40
	(turning from the narrative to praise of the victor), [c dimgray]Nem[/c].
	3.26–32 (turning from Heracles to more relevant heroes),
	[c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 4.69–72 (curtailment of stories about the Aeacidae),
	and [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 5.14–21 (refusal to tell why Peleus and Telamon
	were exiled). A similar technique is used to terminate catalogs,
	as at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 13.40–48, [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 7.50–53, [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 10.19–20, and
	[c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 1.60–63.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Twentieth-century scholars have identified and studied
	a poetic device widespread in Greek and Latin poetry
	called a priamel.
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] The form consists of two parts: foil and
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c]F. Dornseiff, [c dimgray]Pindars Stil[/c] (Berlin 1921) 97–102 provides the
	initial treatment of priamels in Pindar. For an overview, see W. H.
	Race, [c dimgray]The Classical Priamel from Homer to Boethius[/c] (Leiden
	1982).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 22[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	climax. The purpose of the foil is to lead up to and highlight
	the climactic element by adducing other examples, which
	yield to that element with varying degrees of contrast or
	analogy. The foil may consist of two or more items, even a
	full catalog, or it may be summarized by such words as
	“many” (πολύς) or “various” (ἄλλοτ᾿ ἀλλοῖος). Priamels
	may occur at the beginning of an ode, as in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1, where water
	and gold (both supreme in their realms) yield to the
	item of real interest, the Olympic games, supreme among
	athletic contests, and in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 11, where the need for winds
	or rains is capped by the need for song to celebrate great
	achievements; but priamels occur throughout the extant
	works whenever the poet wishes to introduce or emphasize
	a particular subject. For example, at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 9.67–70 a list
	of places from which foreign settlers have come to Opus
	culminates in its most distinguished immigrant, Menoetius.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray]Meter, Form, Dialect, and Style[/c]
	There are three basic meters in the poetry of Pindar. By
	far the most frequent are dactylo-epitritic and Aeolic; the
	third, derived from an iambic base, is represented only by
	[c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2 and [c dimgray]frr[/c]. 75, 105, and 108. The dactylo-epitritic combines
	the dactyl (‒ ⏑ ⏑), often in the larger unit of the
	hemiepes (‒ ⏑ ⏑ ‒ ⏑ ⏑ ‒), with the epitrite (‒ ⏑ ‒ ‒). It is
	a stately rhythm (called “Doric” by Pindar), and although
	used in all the genres, it is especially frequent in those
	celebrating humans: epinicia, encomia, and threnoi. The
	dactylo-epitritic epinicia are: [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13;
	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c]
	[c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 13 is the only epinicion to have strophes and antistrophes
	in Aeolic, epodes in dactylo-epitritic.

	and 6. The major dactylo-epitritic fragments are: [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 9;
	[c dimgray]Hymn[/c]. 1; [c dimgray]Pae[/c]. 5; [c dimgray]Dith[/c]. 2; [c dimgray]Thren[/c]. 7; [c dimgray]frr[/c]. 42, 43, 122, 123,
	124, 131b, and 133. The Aeolic rhythm permits greater variety
	and is composed mainly of iambs (⏑ ‒) and choriambs
	(‒ ⏑ ⏑ ‒). It is especially frequent in the paeans. The
	Aeolic epinicia are: [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 13, 14; [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 2, 5, 6, 7,
	8, 10, 11; [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7; [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 7, and 8. The major Aeolic
	fragments are: [c dimgray]Pae[/c]. 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9; [c dimgray]Parth[/c]. 1, 2; and [c dimgray]fr[/c]. 169a.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The odes are built of stanzas called strophes, antistrophes,
	and epodes. The first stanza, varying in length
	from three to twenty lines, is called a strophe. Seven
	epinicia ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 14; [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 6, 12; [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 2, 4, 9; and [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 8) and
	a few fragments ([c dimgray]Pae[/c]. 5, [c dimgray]frr[/c]. 122 and 124ab) repeat the
	metrical pattern of the strophe two to twelve times and
	are called “monostrophic.” The remaining thirty-eight
	epinicia, most paeans, [c dimgray]Dith[/c]. 2, [c dimgray]Parth[/c]. 1 and 2, [c dimgray]frr[/c]. 123,
	140a, and 169a are “triadic,” in that the strophe is followed
	by a metrically identical stanza called an antistrophe,
	which in turn is followed by a metrically distinct stanza
	called an epode, the three forming a unit called a triad.
	Each successive triad is metrically identical. Five epinicia
	consist of one triad ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 4, 11, 12; [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 7; and [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 3); most
	have three to five triads, except for the exceptionally long
	[c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4, which has thirteen.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar’s dialect is a highly artificial idiom which contains
	such a complex mixture of epic, Doric, and Aeolic
	forms that only a very superficial sketch can be given
	here.
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c] Epic vocabulary and forms familiar from Homeric
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	verse are evident throughout (although Pindar avoids
	forms in -φι). The most obvious feature of the Doric dialect
	is a long a for Ionic η (e.g., ἀρετά for ἀρετή and
	Κυράνα for Κυρήνη) and -ᾶν for -ῶν in genitive plurals of
	the first declension (e.g., τᾶν ἀρετᾶν παςᾶν for τῶν
	ἀρετῶν παςῶν). Aeolic forms are most apparent in the
	use of oi instead of ou in some nouns (e.g., Μοῖσα for
	Μοῦσα), verbs (e.g., τρέφοισι for τρέφουσι), and aorist
	participles (e.g., ἰδοῖσα for ἰδοῦσα).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In his discussion of the austere style (whose practitioners
	include Aeschylus, Pindar, Antiphon, and Thucydides),
	Dionysius of Halicarnassus makes many observations
	applicable to Pindar’s style ([c dimgray]de Compositione[/c]
	22).
	[m1]\ [/m]

	\[The austere style\] is not loath to use frequent harsh
	and dissonant collocations, like stones put together
	in building that are not squared or polished, but
	rough and improvised. It generally likes expansion
	with big, long words,
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c] for it is averse to being constrained
	to few syllables unless compelled to do
	so . . . In its clauses it chooses stately and grand
	rhythms; it does not like clauses of equal length, of
	similar sound, or slaves to a necessary order,
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] but
	ones that are noble, brilliant, and free; it wishes
	them to resemble nature rather than art and to reflect
	emotion rather than character . . . The austere

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	style is further marked by flexibility of cases, variety
	of figures, use of few connectives and no articles,
	and frequent disregard for normal sequence. Far
	from being polished, it is high-minded, outspoken,
	blunt—its beauty being the patina of old-fashionedness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The best known characterization of Pindar’s style is
	by Horace in [c dimgray]Odes[/c] 4.2.5–12: “Like a river rushing down
	a mountain which rains have swollen above its normal
	banks, the deep-voiced Pindar seethes and floods far and
	wide, sure to win Apollo’s laurels when he tumbles new
	words through his daring dithyrambs, and is carried along
	by rhythms freed from rules.” From these descriptions we
	can isolate the following general characteristics of Pindar’s
	style: it is abundant, creative of new words and expressions,
	bold, passionate, old-fashioned, tinged with aristocratic
	bluntness, disdainful of the ordinary, and displays a
	rough strength typical of nature rather than of balanced
	art.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Perhaps the most pervasive aspect of Pindar’s style is
	ποικιλία (variety), a term he himself applies to his poetry
	(e.g., [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6.87 and [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 9.77). His verse gives the impression
	of ever new creativity. In the epinicia, a genre which
	requires that similar points be repeated, he is especially
	adept at finding alternate wordings, different metaphors,
	allusive references, synonyms, circumlocutions, or negative
	expressions to vary the idiom. For example, on nine
	occasions he mentions the relationship between someone’s
	performance and his appearance; ten times he states
	that an individual has reached the limits of human success.
	Yet by variations of wording, rhythm, and emphasis, he
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 26[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	avoids exact repetition and produces strikingly new formulations.
	[c dimgray][sup]26[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A major component of Pindar’s ποικιλία is what J. E.
	Sandys called “a constant and habitual use of metaphor.”
	[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c]
	There are hundreds of metaphorical expressions, some so
	slight as to be barely perceptible, others extremely bold.
	Pindar is not averse to mixing metaphors and occasionally
	piles them up at a confusing rate. For example, at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6.90–
	91 he calls his chorus trainer “a true messenger, a message
	stick of the Muses, a sweet mixing bowl of songs.” In order
	to express the exaltation of being celebrated in poetry, he
	describes the victor as “lifted on the splendid wings of the
	melodious Pierians” ([c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 1.64–65). This expression contains
	three perceptual categories—height, brightness, and
	sound—from which Pindar constantly draws metaphors to
	designate the joy and celebration of victory, while, conversely,
	images of depth, darkness, and silence are used to
	characterize the disappointment of defeat. To describe his
	poetic art, he draws metaphors from farming, sailing, chariot
	driving, archery, flying, wrestling, building, sculpture,
	weaving, javelin throwing, and business. The song can be a
	crown, mirror, building, storehouse, drink, toast, wave,
	flame, breeze, doctor, remedy, or charm.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Stated comparisons are frequent in the poems. Gold
	shines “like fire blazing in the night” ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1.1–2), mere
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]

	learners are “like a pair of crows” ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2.87), the poet is
	“like a cork” ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 2.80) or a “wolf” ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 2.84), and his
	song “flits like a bee” ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 10.54). Pindar opens three
	odes with similes that compare his poetry to a splendid
	palace ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6.1–4), to the toast given by a father to his son-in-
	law ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 7.1–10), and to libations at a symposium ([c dimgray]Isth[/c].
	6.1–9). At [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 10.86–90 he compares his late-arriving
	poem to a son finally born to an aged man. Often, however,
	the comparison is left implicit or unstated.
	[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c] For example,
	at [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 6.26 he acts like (ὥτ᾿) an archer, but at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2.83 and
	[c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 9.5 he simply appears as one; at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 13.93 he is a javelin
	thrower, whereas at [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1.44 the ὡσείτ᾿ makes the comparison
	explicit.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar is much more sparing than authors such as Aeschylus
	or Lucretius in the use of alliteration. One place,
	however, where he uses it to obvious effect is in the description
	of the eruption of Mt. Aetna at [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1.23–24,
	which ends with ἀλλ᾿ ἐν ὄρφναισιν πέτρας | φοίνισσα
	κυλινδομένα φλὸξ ἐς βαθεῖαν φέρει πόντου πλάκα σὺν
	πατάγῳ (“but in times of darkness a rolling red flame carries
	rocks into the deep expanse of the sea with a crash”), in
	which the φ’s and π᾿s imitate the sound of the crashing
	rocks (and perhaps the σ’s echo the hissing of the flames).
	At times there appears to be an intentional correspondence
	between rhythm and sense, as in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1, where there
	is an unusually long string of seven short syllables in
	the eighth verse of each strophe and antistrophe, in three
	of which the word “swift” (ταχυ-) occurs: μετὰ τὸ
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c]F. Dornseiff, [c dimgray]Pindars Stil[/c] (Berlin 1921) 97 labels this phenomenon
	“Vergleich ohne wie.”

	ταχύπτομον (66), ἐμὲ δ᾿ ἐπὶ ταχυτάτων (77), Πέλοπος,
	ἵνα ταχυτάς (95).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There are a number of puns on names, such as Iamus
	and ἴων (violets) at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6.55, Ajax and αἰετόν (eagle) at [c dimgray]Isth[/c].
	6.50, Orion and ὀρειᾶν (mountain) at [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 2.11, Hieron
	and ἱερῶν (temples) at [c dimgray]fr[/c]. 105a2, and perhaps Athens and
	ἀεθληταῖσιν (athletes) at [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 5.49. In [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 2 the recurrence
	of the word ξένος (24, 39, 48) in an ode praising
	Xenocrates for his lavish hospitality seems deliberate.
	Pindar sometimes employs riddles or kennings; for example,
	a honeycomb is “the perforated labor of bees” ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c].
	6.54) and Panathenaic amphoras are “richly wrought containers
	of earth baked in fire” ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 10.36).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Certain images, themes, or related words are particularly
	prevalent in some odes: for example, words related to
	eating in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1; an unusual number of pairs in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6; gold,
	plants, and weather in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 7; time in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 10; music in [c dimgray]Pyth[/c].
	1; numerous words pertaining to knowledge and the mind
	in [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 3; references to medicine in [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 3 and [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4;
	and courtship and athletics in [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 9. Nautical imagery
	occurs throughout the odes.
	[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The odes are also rich textures of verbal echoes, and
	scholars have carefully listed many occurrences of repeated
	words and sounds, especially in metrically equivalent

PINDAR, Olympian Odes
	[c darkmagenta][b]PINDAR, Olympian Odes[/b][/c]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	words is indisputable—Fennell lists over sixty words recurring
	one or more times in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1 alone—there is considerable
	disagreement about the significance of individual
	cases, and attempts to discover meaning in them often create
	ingenious but implausible interpretations.
	Because of the pliability of Greek as an inflected language
	and the requirements of intricate metrical patterns,
	Pindar often places great strains on word order. As a result,
	many sentences must be pieced together like puzzles (e.g.,
	[c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 4.18–18a).
	[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c] Hyperbaton, a lengthy separation of two
	grammatically connected words, occurs frequently. Two
	extreme examples are at [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4.106–108, where ἀρχαίαν
	is separated from its noun τιμάν by fifteen words, and at
	[c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 12.5–6a, where the article αἱ is separated from its noun
	ἐλπίδες by thirteen words. Often, important words are
	withheld for climactic effect until the end of a sentence, or
	are enjambed at the beginning of a line or stanza.
	[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Enallage (hypallage) or transferred epithet, by which
	an attribute belonging logically to one thing is grammatically
	given to another, is very common.
	[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c] Some examples
	are so slight as to be barely noticeable, such as “the tawny
	herds of cattle” ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4.149); others are much bolder, such
	as “your honor of feet” (=“the honor of your feet,” [c dimgray]Ol[/c].
	12.13) and “fearless seed of Heracles” (=“the seed of fearless
	Heracles,” [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 10.17). The so-called [c dimgray]schema Pin[/c]-

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	[c dimgray]daricum[/c], in which a singular verb is used with a masculine
	or feminine plural subject, is infrequent in the epinicia,
	but particularly noticeable in [c dimgray]Dith[/c]. 2, where there are
	three instances in the first thirteen verses. There are also
	striking examples of zeugma (the use of one verb with differing
	meanings for two objects) as at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1.88, where
	Pelops took (i.e. defeated) Oenomaus and took (i.e. won)
	Hippodameia as a bride (cf. also [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1.40).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Other figures include hendiadys, two nouns that express
	a single thought, (e.g., [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1.37: στεφάνοισι
	ἵπποις τε, “crowns and horses” = “victorious horses”), and
	various kinds of brachylogy or ellipsis, in which connecting
	elements have been omitted. A complex example of
	brachylogy occurs at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 12.13–15: “truly would the honor
	of \[i.e. won by\] your feet, like \[that of\] a fighting cock . . .
	have \[like a tree or wreath\] dropped its leaves ingloriously.”
	Finally, Pindar scrupulously avoids precise grammatical
	symmetry of terms in pairs or series. For example,
	instead of a simple “day and night” we find ἁμέραισιν μὲν
	. . . ἀλλ᾿ ἐν ὄρφναισιν ([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1.22–23), ἆμαρ ἢ νύκτες
	([c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4. 256), and ἐφαμερίαν . . . μετὰ νύκτας ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 6.6).
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray]Pindar’s Legacy[/c]
	Since choral epinician poetry ceased to be written soon
	after Pindar’s death, his style and subject matter exerted
	more influence on subsequent Greek and Roman authors
	than did his genre. In the 4th century Isocrates
	adapted many Pindaric poetic strategies and topics to his
	prose works, particularly those praising individuals (e.g.,
	[c dimgray]Evagoras[/c]) or advising them (e.g., [c dimgray]To Demonicus, To[/c]

	[c dimgray]Nicocles[/c], and [c dimgray]To Philip[/c]).
	[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c] In the Hellenistic period
	Callimachus (in his Hymns) and Theocritus (in his [c dimgray]Idylls[/c])
	exhibit Pindaric influence, especially the latter in his panegyric
	of Hieron II ([c dimgray]Id[/c]. 16) and in his portrayal of the infant
	Heracles’ fight with the snakes sent by Hera ([c dimgray]Id[/c]. 24), an
	episode treated by Pindar in [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 1.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Roman poet most indebted to Pindar was Horace,
	whose eulogy of Augustus ([c dimgray]Odes[/c] 1.12) opens with a quotation
	from Pindar’s [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2: “What man, what hero do you undertake
	to celebrate on the lyre or shrill pipe, Clio, and
	what god?” His hymn to Calliope ([c dimgray]Odes[/c] 3.4) is to a considerable
	extent modeled on [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 1. Horace’s greatest tribute
	to Pindar, however, is in [c dimgray]Odes[/c] 4.2, which opens with
	Pindar’s name and describes the dangers of trying to emulate
	him: “Whoever strives to rival Pindar, Julus, relies on
	wings waxed by Daedalus’ craft and will give his name to a
	transparent sea.” In the next five stanzas Horace describes
	Pindar’s poetry in terms of its power, range, and grandeur,
	and compares it to a rushing river. He then goes on to
	contrast Pindar, “the Swan of Dirce,” soaring among the
	clouds, with himself, the small “Bee of Matinus,” staying
	low to the ground and laboriously gathering thyme. This
	exaggerated characterization of these two styles provided
	the Renaissance with its distinction between the “greater”
	Pindaric and the “lesser” Horatian odes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Soon after Pindar’s epinicia were published in Europe
	in the early 16th century, the French poet Ronsard, who

	[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c]For an examination of Isocrates’ adaptations, see W. H.

	of the American Philological Association[/c] 117 (1987) 131–
	155.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 32[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	aspired to become the “French Pindar,” published a collection
	of fourteen Pindaric odes in praise of contemporaries
	in 1550.
	[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c] The first important Pindaric adaptation in
	English poetry is Ben Jonson’s “To the Immortal Memory
	and Friendship of that Noble Pair, Sir Lucius Cary and Sir
	H. Morison” (1630), which imitates Pindar’s triadic structure
	with “Turns,” “Counter-Turns,” and “Stands.” In 1656
	Abraham Cowley published his “Pindarique Odes.” He
	began his preface with the famous statement: “If a man
	should undertake to translate Pindar word for word, it
	would be thought that one mad-man had translated another.”
	Taking as his point of departure Horace’s description
	of Pindar in [c dimgray]Odes[/c] 4.2, Cowley emphasized Pindar’s
	“enthusiastical manner” and produced irregular verse without
	regard for triadic structure.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After Cowley, “Pindaric” became a label for any poem
	of irregular form with pretensions of grandeur. Boileau’s
	“Ode sur la Prise de Namur” (1693) and Dryden’s “Alexander’s
	Feast” (1697) are examples, as are Gray’s “Progress of
	Poesy” and “The Bard” (1757). The early German Romantics
	admired Pindar (especially Hölderlin, who translated a
	number of his epinicia), but afterwards his influence began
	to diminish. Although English Romantic poems such as
	Wordsworth’s “Ode: Intimations of Immortality” (1807)
	and later poems such as G. M. Hopkins’ “TheWreck of the
	Deutschland” (1875) are sometimes called Pindaric odes,
	they bear little resemblance in form or content to Pindar’s
	poems.

PINDAR, Olympian Odes
	[c darkmagenta][b]PINDAR, Olympian Odes[/b][/c]
	[b]Introduction[/b]

	[c dimgray]History of the Text[/c]
	The most important early editor of Pindar’s works was
	Aristophanes of Byzantium, head librarian in Alexandria
	c. 194–180 b.c., who divided the individual poems into
	short lines based on metrical cola and the entire corpus
	into seventeen books. The numerous epinicia were separated
	into manageable rolls according to the four major
	games at which the victories were won. Within each roll
	the odes were ordered by the categories of events, beginning
	with the equestrian (in the order of chariot race,
	horse race, mule car race) followed by the gymnastic (in
	the order of pancratium, wrestling, boxing, pentathlon,
	and foot races).
	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Since only the wealthy could afford to raise and train
	horses of the caliber to win at the great games, this arrangement
	favored Pindar’s powerful patrons and placed
	more impressive odes at the beginning of each roll. Deviations
	from this system are instructive. If strict order were
	followed, [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2 and 3 celebrating Theron’s chariot victory
	should precede [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1 celebrating Hieron’s single-horse victory,
	but we are told that Aristophanes placed the latter
	first because it contained praise of the Olympic games.
	The eminence of Hieron and the scale of the ode must
	have been factors in this reversal as well, because [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 3 also
	tells of the establishment of the Olympic games. It is questionable
	whether [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 2 celebrates a Pythian victory at
	all, while [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 3, not an epinicion in any strict sense,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c]Simonides’ epinicia were arranged by events won; apart
	from the fact that odes for the same victor are grouped together,
	no particular order is apparent among Bacchylides’ epinicia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 34[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Introduction[/b]
	merely refers in passing to a previous single-horse victory
	at Pytho. Yet these two poems were placed ahead of [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4
	and 5 that celebrate Arcesilas’ chariot victory, presumably
	to form a group of odes to Pindar’s greatest patron. Anomalous
	odes were placed at the end of books. The final
	Pythian ode, [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 12, celebrates a victory in pipe-playing,
	and the last three Nemeans were not composed for
	Nemean victories. [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 9 celebrates a chariot victory in
	the Sicyonian games, [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 10 a wrestling victory in the
	Argive games (although previous victories in the crown
	games are mentioned), and [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 11 celebrates the installation
	of a former athlete as a magistrate in Tenedos.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Two Pindaric scholars of note who followed Aristophanes
	of Byzantium were Aristarchus of Samothrace
	(c. 217–145 b.c.) and Didymus (c. 80–10 b.c.), the latter of
	whom composed lengthy commentaries, bits of which
	have come down to us as scholia (marginal notes) in our
	MSS. In the 3rd century a.d. the other books began to
	drop out of circulation and only the four books of epinicia
	continued to be read.
	[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c] About this time they were transferred
	from papyrus rolls to codices, apparently in the
	order of the founding of the games: Olympian, Pythian,
	Isthmian, and Nemean. At some point the last two books
	were interchanged and some of the final pages of the Isthmian
	odes were lost.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In the 4th and 5th century a.d. two recensions of
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c]See J. Irigoin, [c dimgray]Histoire du texte de Pindare[/c] (Paris 1952).
	Eustathius, [c dimgray]Praefatio[/c] 34 reports that the epinicia were especially
	popular because they were more concerned with human affairs
	(ἀνθρωπικώτεροι), contained fewer myths, and were not as difficult
	as the other genres.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	the epinicia took shape: the Ambrosian recension, represented
	by a single MS in the Ambrosian Library in Milan
	(end of 13th cent.), and the Vatican recension, best represented
	by two MSS, one in the Vatican Library (end of
	12th cent.)
	[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c] and the other in the Laurentian Library in
	Florence (early 14th cent.). Although both recensions derive
	from the same source (probably a 2nd cent. edition),
	they differ, especially in their scholia. Two lesser recensions
	are the Parisina, best represented by a MS in Paris
	(late 13th cent.), and the Gottingensis, by aMS in Göttingen
	(mid-13th cent.).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The late Byzantine period saw a revival of editorial
	work on Pindar. Eustathius (d. c. 1194) wrote a commentary,
	but only the preface has survived. A century later
	editions were prepared by Thomas Magister (c. 1280–
	1350), Manuel Moschopulus (fl. 1300), and Demetrius
	Triclinius (c. 1280–1340). Modern editors have adopted
	many of their readings, and many of the more than 180 extant
	MSS exhibit their editorial work.

	[c dimgray]The editio princeps[/c] is the Aldine (Venice 1513). The
	first Latin translation is by Lonicerus (Basel 1535). Erasmus
	Schmid’s edition (Wittenberg 1616) is a landmark of
	Renaissance scholarship on Pindar, notable for its rhetorical
	schemata of each ode and many sound emendations.
	It was closely followed by Iohannes Benedictus’
	text (Saumur 1620), the most widely used edition in the
	17th century (John Milton owned and annotated a copy).
	The next edition of note was C. G. Heyne’s (Göttingen
	1798), soon superseded by the monumental edition of
	August Boeckh (Leipzig 1811–1821), which first set forth
	the division of Pindar’s verse into periods rather than
	cola and provided extensive commentaries (those on the
	Nemeans and Isthmians were written by Ludwig Dissen).
	Dissen soon followed with his own edition (Gotha 1830).
	Tycho Mommsen (Berlin 1864) provided the first systematic
	examination of the Byzantine MSS. Otto Schroeder
	produced an important critical edition (Leipzig 1900).
	Alexander Turyn’s edition (Cracow 1948; Oxford 1952)
	is notable for its scrupulous examination of manuscripts
	and copious testimonia. Although differing in many
	details and numerous readings adopted, the present
	text is based primarily on the eighth edition of Snell-
	Maehler’s Epinicia (1987) and H. Maehler’s Fragmenta

	[b]Olympian 1[/b]

	[c dimgray]Olympian[/c] 1 celebrates Hieron’s victory in the singlehorse
	race (keles) in 476 (confirmed by P. Oxy. 222). The
	more prestigious four-horse chariot race (tethrippon) was
	won by Theron of Acragas and celebrated by Pindar in
	[c dimgray]Olympians[/c] 2 and 3. In the normal order established by
	the Alexandrian editors, it would have followed the odes
	to Theron, but the [c dimgray]Vita Thomana[/c] reports (1.7 Dr.) that
	Aristophanes of Byzantium placed Olympian 1 first in the
	collection because it “contained praise of the Olympic
	games and told of Pelops, the first to compete in Elis.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ode opens with a priamel, in which water and gold,
	best in their respective realms, serve as foil for the greatest
	of games, the Olympics (1–7). Hieron is briefly praised for
	his wealth, hospitality, political power, achievements celebrated
	in song (8–17), and in particular for the Olympic
	victory of his horse Pherenicus (17–23).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The central portion of the poem contains Pindar’s refashioning
	of the story of Pelops. Little is known about this
	myth before Pindar, but a former version (cf. 36) seems
	to have been that Tantalus served his dismembered son
	Pelops at a banquet for the gods, who, upon discovering
	this, resurrected him from the cauldron, replaced part of
	his shoulder (supposedly eaten by Demeter) with ivory,
	and punished Tantalus in Hades. Pindar attributes the
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 44[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	appeal of such a tale to the charm of exaggerated story telling
	(28–32) and its details to the gossip of an envious neighbor
	(46–51). In Pindar’s version, Pelops was born with an ivory
	shoulder (26–27) and Tantalus gave a most proper feast
	(38), at which Poseidon fell in love with Pelops and took
	him to Olympus as Zeus later did with Ganymede (37–45).
	Tantalus’ punishment resulted from stealing nectar and
	ambrosia from the gods and sharing them with his human
	companions (55–64). As a consequence, Pelops was returned
	to earth (65–66). When he grew to young manhood,
	he desired to win Hippodameia in the contest contrived by
	her father Oenomaus, who killed all suitors unable to beat
	him in a chariot race. He called upon his former lover
	Poseidon for help and the god gave him a golden chariot
	and winged horses, with which he defeated Oenomaus,
	thereby winning Hippodameia, by whom he had six sons
	(67–89). Pelops’ tomb now stands beside the altar of Zeus
	at Olympia (90–93).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar mentions the fame and satisfaction belonging
	to Olympic victors (93–99), praises Hieron as the most
	knowledgeable and powerful host of his time (100–108),
	and hopes that he will be able to celebrate a future chariot
	victory (108–111). In a brief priamel, he declares that
	kings occupy the apex of greatness, and concludes by praying
	that Hieron may enjoy his high status for the rest of his
	life and that he himself may celebrate victors as the foremost
	Panhellenic poet (111–116).

	[b]WINNER, SINGLE-HORSE RACE, 476 B.C.[/b]

	Best is water, while gold, like fire blazing

	for another star shining more warmly by day
	through the empty sky,
	nor let us proclaim a contest greater than Olympia.
	From there comes the famous hymn that encompasses
	the thoughts of wise men, who have come
	[c dimgray]10[/c]in celebration of Cronus’ son
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] to the rich
	and blessed hearth of Hieron,

	Pelops (36) and Hieron (107, 115) also signal climactic passages.

	once again among the shortlived race of men.
	And toward the age of youthful bloom,
	when downy hair began covering his darkened chin,
	he took thought of the marriage that was open to all,
	[m1]\ [/m]

	to winning famous Hippodameia from her father,
	[c dimgray]71[/c]the Pisan. He approached the gray sea alone at night
	and called upon the deep-thundering
	Lord of the Fine Trident, who appeared
	right by his feet.
	[c dimgray]75[/c]He said to him, “If the loving gifts of Cypris
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c]
	count at all for gratitude, Poseidon,
	come! hold back the bronze spear of Oenomaus
	and speed me in the swiftest of chariots
	to Elis
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] and bring me to victorious power,
	[c dimgray]80[/c]for having killed thirteen suitors
	he puts off the marriage
	of his daughter. Great risk
	does not take hold of a cowardly man.
	But since men must die, why would anyone sit
	in darkness and coddle a nameless old age to no use,
	deprived of all noble deeds? No!
	that contest shall be mine
	[c dimgray]85[/c]to undertake; you grant the success I desire.”
	Thus he spoke, and wielded no unfulfilled
	words. The god honored him

	[b]OLYMPIAN 2[/b]

	[c dimgray]Olympians[/c] 2 and 3 celebrate the victory of Theron of
	Acragas with the [c dimgray]tethrippon[/c] in 476. The city of Acragas
	(modern Agrigento), a colony of Gela, flourished under
	Theron and his brother Xenocrates (also celebrated in
	[c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 6 and [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 2), who belonged to the clan of the
	Emmenidae and claimed a Theban hero Thersandrus as
	an ancestor. Theron became tyrant of Acragas around 488
	and conquered Himera in 482. In 480 he and Gelon of Syracuse
	defeated the Carthaginians at the battle of Himera,
	spoils from which helped make Acragas one of the most
	splendid cities in Western Greece.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ode opens with a priamel (imitated by Horace,
	[c dimgray]Odes[/c] 1.12), which culminates in Theron’s Olympic victory
	(1–6). He is praised for his hospitality to foreigners and
	for his civic-mindedness, as the most recent in a distinguished
	family of benefactors who have labored on behalf
	of Acragas. The poet seals his praise with a prayer to Zeus
	as god of Olympia that their progeny may inherit the land
	(6–15).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Gnomic reflections follow: time cannot change what
	has happened in the past, but good fortune can bring forgetfulness
	and quell the pain (15–22). Two Theban examples
	are cited: Semele, who, slain by Zeus’ thunderbolt, is
	beloved on Olympus and Ino, who enjoys immortality in
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 60[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	the sea among the Nereids (22–30). Humans, however,
	do not know when they will die, or if a day will end well,
	because they are subject to alternations of happiness and
	suffering (30–34). So it was with Theron’s ancestors:
	Oedipus slew his father Laius and the Fury of vengeance
	(Erinys) caused his sons to kill each other, but Polyneices’
	son Thersandrus survived to win glory in athletics and war
	and to continue the line of Adrastus, king of Argos (35–45).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As a descendant of Thersandrus, Theron deserves to be
	celebrated, because he has won an Olympic victory, as his
	brother has won chariot victories at Delphi and at the
	Isthmus (46–51). Several gnomic reflections follow on the
	proper use of wealth for virtuous ends and on the punishment
	that awaits the spirits of evildoers after death (51–
	58), in the midst of which Pindar gives an account of the
	afterlife, the most extensive in his extant poetry, which
	envisions the transmigration of souls and their reward and
	punishment. The passage culminates in a description of
	the Isle of the Blessed, inhabited by those who have lived
	just lives through three cycles: Peleus, Cadmus, and Achilles
	(58–83).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Appearing in the guise of an archer, the poet declares
	that he has many things to say, but declines to do so, further
	comparing himself to an eagle who is wise by nature
	in contrast to mere learners who are like crows (83–88).
	Taking aim with his arrows at Acragas, he declares that no
	city in a century has produced a man more generous and
	kind than Theron. He then stops short of enumerating
	Theron’s benefactions because, like grains of sand, they
	cannot be counted (89–100).

	[b]Olympian 3[/b]
	This ode celebrates the same victory as [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2. The
	scholia report that it was performed for the Theoxenia
	(feast of welcome for gods) honoring the children of Tyndareus,
	but the evidence for this theory is derived from the
	poem itself and has no compelling authority. The centerpiece
	of the poem is the etiological narrative, structured in
	ring composition, that tells how Heracles brought the olive
	tree from the land of the Hyperboreans to grace the Olympic
	festival that he had just founded.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet hopes to please the Tyndaridae and their sister
	Helen as he honors Acragas in celebration of Theron’s
	Olympic victory (1–4). The Muse has assisted him in his
	endeavor to compose this new ode in Doric meter for a
	victor crowned by the Olympic judges with a wreath of
	olive, which Heracles brought from the region of the
	Danube (4–15). The narrative relates how, after arranging
	the games, Heracles realized that the precinct lacked trees
	to provide either shade or victory crowns. During a previous
	trip to the Hyperboreans in search of Artemis’ goldenhorned
	doe, he had admired their olive trees, and upon
	returning there, he obtained their permission to take
	some to plant at Olympia (16–34). After his apotheosis on
	Olympus, Heracles entrusted supervision of the games
	to the Tyndaridae, and it is because of Theron’s and his
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 76[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	family’s devoted entertainment of these heroes that they
	have won such honor in the games (34–41). He concludes
	the poem with a priamel that echoes the opening of [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1,
	declaring that Theron has reached the limits of human
	achievement, the Pillars of Heracles, beyond which only
	fools would attempt to travel (42–45).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Olympian 4[/b]

	[c dimgray]Olympians[/c] 4 and 5 celebrate victories of Psaumis of
	Camarina, a city on the south shore of Sicily between
	Acragas and Syracuse. The scholia give the occasion of [c dimgray]Ol[/c].
	4 as a chariot victory in the 82nd Olympiad (452 b.c.), confirmed
	by the entry in P. Oxy. 222: σαμιου καμ\[αριναιου
	τεθριππον, where σαμιου is undoubtedly a mistake for
	Ψαυμι(δ)ov, and by P. Oxy. 2438. The words Ἐλατήρ (1),
	ὀχέων (11), and ἵππων (14) point to a victory with the
	[c dimgray]tethrippon[/c], but some argue that the ode celebrates a different
	victory entirely—that for the mule car commemorated
	in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 5.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What we know of Psaumis must be inferred from these
	two odes. He appears to have been a wealthy private citizen
	who helped rebuild Camarina in 461/460 after its destruction
	by Gelon of Syracuse in the 480’s.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poem opens with an invocation of Zeus as charioteer
	of the storm cloud, occasioned because his daughters
	the Horae (Seasons) have sent the poet as a witness of the
	greatest games (1–3). After a gnomic reflection on the joy
	occasioned by news of a friend’s success, Pindar reinvokes
	Zeus as subduer of Typhos and lord of Mt. Aetna, and requests
	that he receive favorably this Olympic victory ode
	for Psaumis, who comes in his chariot, crowned with an
	olive wreath (4–12). The victor is praised for his
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 86[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	horsebreeding, his hospitality to many guests, and for his devotion
	to Hesychia (Peace, Concord) in his city (14–16).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet claims that his praise is truthful and justifies it
	by citing the example of Erginus, one of the Argonauts,
	who, in spite of appearing too old, won the race in armor
	during the games held by Hypsipyle on Lemnos (17–27).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Olympian 5[/b]
	This is the only victory ode in our MSS whose Pindaric
	authorship has been questioned. A heading in the
	Ambrosian MS (1.138.21 Dr.) states, “this poem was not
	among the texts, but in the commentaries of Didymus \[1st
	cent. b.c.\] it was said to be Pindar’s. ”Although this information
	has occasioned much discussion of the poem’s
	status, no compelling arguments for its exclusion from
	Pindar’s works have been advanced. It celebrates Psaumis’
	victory in the mule car ([c dimgray]apene[/c]), at some time between the
	resettlement of the city of Camarina in 461/460 and the
	elimination of the event from the Olympic games in 444.
	The most probable date is 448.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Each of its three triads (the shortest in the victory odes)
	addresses a different deity. In the first, Camarina is asked
	to welcome Psaumis, who exalted the city that bears her
	name at the Olympic games by providing feasts of oxen
	and furnishing entries in the races with chariots, mules,
	and single horses. His victory has brought glory to his
	newly built city and to his father Acron (1–8).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Upon his return from Olympia, Psaumis sings the
	praises of Pallas Athena, the Oanus River, the lake of
	Camarina, and the Hipparis River, which sustains the citizens
	through its canals. Psaumis apparently aided his people
	by building houses for them (9–14). Hard work and
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 92[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	expenses are required to compete for a victory whose
	achievement is risky and uncertain, but when a man succeeds,
	even his townsmen credit him with wisdom (15–
	16).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Finally, the poet invokes Zeus the Savior to grant the
	city more deeds of valor and wishes Psaumis a happy old
	age with his sons at his side (17–23). He concludes with
	the observation that a man who possesses adequate wealth
	and uses it to acquire fame has reached a mortal’s limits
	(23–24).

	gifts of the tirelessly running mule car and of Psaumis,
	[m1]\ [/m]

	who, exalting your people-nourishing city, Camarina,
	[c dimgray]5[/c]honored the six double altars
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] at the gods’ greatest festival
	with sacrifices of oxen and in the five days
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] of athletic contests
	[m1]\ [/m]

	with chariots, mules, and single-horse racing. By
	winning,
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	he has dedicated luxurious glory to you and proclaimed

	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] newly founded home.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Camarina, nymph of the nearby lake for which the city was named.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]According to Herodorus (quoted by the schol.), Heracles dedicated six double alters to Zeus\[n-dash\]Poseidon, Hera\[n-dash\]Athena, Hermes\[n-dash\]Apollo, Charites\[n-dash\]Dionysus, Artemis\[n-dash\]Alpheus, and Cronus\[n-dash\]Rhea.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]The reading pemptamÁroiv “on the fifth day ”in most MSS
	does not make sense because the equestrian events were held
	early in the Olympic program (Paus. 5.9.3). Evidently Psaumis
	was conspicuous throughout the festival for his large sacrifices.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Olympian 6[/b]
	Hagesias, son of Sostratus, was apparently a close associate
	of Hieron and a prominent Syracusan, but his family
	lived in Stymphalus in Arcadia, and it was evidently there
	that this ode was first performed. From his father’s side
	Hagesias inherited the prophetic gifts of the family of the
	Iamidae and the position of custodial priest of the prophetic
	altar of Zeus at Olympia. In one of his most celebrated
	narratives, Pindar tells of the birth of the family’s
	founder, Iamus, whose father was Apollo. From his
	mother’s side, Hagesias inherited Arcadian martial and
	athletic prowess. Pindar hopes that Hagesias will enjoy a
	warm welcome from Hieron (who is highly praised) when
	he arrives in Syracuse. The most probable dates for the victory
	are 472 or 468, during the latter years of Hieron’s
	reign. Unfortunately, P. Oxy. 222 provides no confirmation
	since it does not list victors in the mule race.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar opens by comparing his poem to a splendid palace
	and his introduction to a porch with golden columns
	(1–4). He sketches Hagesias’ achievements: Olympic victor,
	steward of Zeus’ altar at Olympia, and a founder of
	Syracuse (4–9). The gnomic observation that only deeds
	achieved through risk and toil are memorable leads to
	Adrastus’ praise of the dead Amphiaraus as a good seer and
	fighter (9–21).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar orders Phintis (presumably Hagesias’ driver) to
	yoke the victorious mules to his chariot of song so that they
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 100[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	can drive to Laconian Pitana to celebrate Hagesias’ ancestry
	(22–28). The nymph Pitana secretly bore Poseidon’s
	child Euadne and sent her to Aepytus of Elis to raise.
	When she was grown, Euadne had intercourse with
	Apollo, and while the angry Aepytus was in Delphi inquiring
	about her pregnancy, she bore a boy in a thicket, where
	he was fed by snakes (29–47). After Aepytus’ return, the
	boy remained hidden in the wilds among violets (ἴα), for
	which his mother named him Iamus (48–57).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When Iamus became a young man, he went at night
	into the Alpheus River and prayed to his grandfather Poseidon
	and father Apollo that he might gain honor as a
	leader (57–61). Apollo’s voice led him to Olympia, where
	he granted him the gift of prophecy and made his family
	(the Iamidae) custodians of Zeus’ altar there. Since that
	time they have been celebrated throughout Hellas (61–
	74). After stating that victory in equestrian competitions is
	especially subject to envy (74–76), the poet observes that
	Hagesias’ athletic success stems from the men in Arcadia
	on his mother’s side, who have gained the favor of Hermes
	and Zeus through their piety (77–81).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar claims personal ties with the city of Stymphalus,
	since Metope, the mother of Thebe (the eponymous
	nymph of Thebes), came from there (82–87). He orders
	Aeneas, probably the chorus trainer, to celebrate Hera
	and to show how sophisticated they are (in spite of being
	Boeotians) by praising Syracuse and its king Hieron.
	Pindar prays that Hieron’s happiness may continue and
	that he may welcome this celebratory revel when it arrives
	from Arcadia (87–100). A concluding prayer expresses the
	hope that both Stymphalians and Syracusans may enjoy a
	glorious destiny and that Poseidon will provide a safe voyage
	for the poem (101–105).

	[b]6. For Hagesias Of Syracuse[/b]
	<h2>
	winner, mule race, 472/468 b.c.</h2>

	Let us set up golden columns to support
	the strong-walled porch of our abode
	and construct, as it were, a splendid
	palace; for when a work is begun, it is necessary to make
	its front shine from afar. If someone should be
	an Olympic victor,
	[c dimgray]5[/c]and steward of the prophetic altar of Zeus at Pisa,
	and fellow-founder
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] of famous Syracuse,
	what hymn of praise could he escape,
	a man such as that, if he finds his townsmen
	ungrudging in the midst of delightful songs?
	[m1]\ [/m]

	Let the son of Sostratus
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] be assured
	that he has his blessed foot
	in such a sandal. Achievements without risk
	[c dimgray]10[/c]win no honor among men or on hollow ships,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]“Fellow-founder ”is a poetic exaggeration. According to the
	scholia Hagesias’ Iamid ancestors settled Syracuse with Archias
	(cf. Thuc. 6.3.2).

	but many remember
	if a noble deed is accomplished with toil.
	Hagesias, the praise stands ready for you
	that Adrastus once justly proclaimed aloud
	about the seer Amphiaraus, son of Oecles,
	when the earth had swallowed up the man himself
	and his shining steeds.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	Afterwards, when the corpses of the seven funeral pyres
	had been consumed,
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Talaus’ son
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	[c dimgray]16[/c]spoke a word such as this at Thebes:
	“I dearly miss the eye of my army,
	good both as a seer and at fighting
	with the spear. ”This is true as well
	for the man from Syracuse who is master of the revel.
	Though not quarrelsome nor one too fond of victory, yet
	[c dimgray]20[/c]I shall swear a great oath and bear clear witness for him
	that this at least is so; and the honey-voiced Muses will
	assist.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	O Phintis,
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] come yoke at once
	the strong mules for me,
	as quickly as possible, so that we may drive our chariot
	on a clear path and I may come to his family’s

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Olympian 7[/b]
	Diagoras of Rhodes was probably the most famous
	boxer in antiquity. He himself was a [c dimgray]periodoniēs[/c] (winner
	at all four major games), while three of his sons and two of
	his grandsons were Olympic victors. Their statues stood in
	Olympia (Paus. 6.7.1–2). Pindar provides extensive praise
	of the Rhodian traditions in a narrative triptych in ring
	composition that proceeds in reverse chronological order,
	beginning with the colonization by Tlapolemus, moving
	back to the institution of a fireless sacrifice to honor the
	newly born Athena, and concluding with the birth of the
	island itself from the depths of the sea as the favored land
	of Helius, the Sun god. These three episodes are linked by
	the fact that in each case a mistake resulted in benefits for
	the island and its people.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In an elaborate simile, Pindar compares his epinician
	poetry to the wine in a golden bowl with which a father
	toasts his new son-in-law (1–10). After observing that
	Charis (Grace, Charm) favors many men with celebratory
	song, Pindar announces that he has come to praise Rhodes
	(the island’s eponymous nymph), Diagoras for his Olympic
	and Pythian boxing victories, and his father Damagetus
	(11–19), and states that he will give a true account of the
	Rhodians’ ancestry from Heracles and Amyntor (20–24).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet introduces the narrative panels with a gnome:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 118[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	the minds of men are beset by countless mistakes and one
	cannot know what will turn out best in the end (24–26).
	Tlapolemus slew his great-uncle Licymnius in anger and
	was told by Apollo to sail to the island of Rhodes where
	Zeus had sent down a snow of gold when Athena was
	born from his head (27–38). Helius enjoined his children
	to set up a ritual sacrifice to win the new goddess’ favor, but
	they forgot to bring fire with them and so had to make a
	fireless sacrifice. As a result of their devotion, however,
	Zeus rained gold upon them, and Athena gave them unsurpassed
	artistic skill to produce lifelike sculptures (39–53).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Ancient tales relate that before Rhodes had appeared
	from the sea, Helius was absent while the gods were being
	allotted their lands and thus received no portion. Zeus proposed
	recasting the lots, but Helius requested Rhodes for
	his own when it should rise from the sea (54–69). When
	it did, Helius lay with the nymph Rhodes and fathered
	seven wise sons, one of whom begot three sons bearing the
	names of prominent Rhodian cities, Camirus, Ialysus, and
	Lindus (69–76).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Rhodians continue to celebrate their founder
	Tlapolemus with festivities and athletic contests, in which
	Diagoras was twice victorious (77–81). An impressive catalog
	of his victories follows, culminating in the present one
	at Olympia (81–90). The poet praises the victor for his upright
	conduct, and mentions his clan, the Eratidae, and an
	ancestor Callianax (90–94). The poem concludes with a
	gnomic reminder of life’s vicissitudes (94–95).

	and great was their fame. When one is expert,
	even native talent becomes greater.
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c]
	The ancient reports of men
	[c dimgray]55[/c]tell that when Zeus and the immortals
	were apportioning the earth,
	Rhodes had not yet appeared in the expanse of the sea,
	but the island lay hidden in the salty depths.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	Since he was absent, no one designated a lot for Helius,
	and thus they left him with no portion of land,
	[c dimgray]60[/c]although he was a holy god.
	And when he spoke of it, Zeus was about to recast
	the lots for him, but he would not allow it, because
	he said that he himself could see a land
	rising from the floor of the gray sea
	that would be bountiful for men and favorable for flocks.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	He immediately ordered Lachesis of the golden
	headband
	[c dimgray]65[/c]to raise her hands and not to forswear
	the mighty oath of the gods,
	but to consent with Cronus’ son
	that once it had arisen into the bright air
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c]I interpret this controversial sentence to mean that Athena
	added skill (τέχναν, 50) to their native talent, so that they combined
	natural wisdom (σοφία ἄδολος) and expertise (δαέντι); cf. D. C. Young, [c dimgray]American Journal of Philology[/c] 108 (1987) 152–157,
	who aptly quotes Horace, [c dimgray]Odes[/c] 4.4.33: [c dimgray]doctrina sed vim promovet
	insitam[/c]. Others translate it as “to the expert even greater skill is
	free from guile ”and see here a defense of the Telchines, mythical
	inhabitants of Rhodes skilled in metal working (cf. Diod. Sic. 5.55
	and Strabo 14.2.7), against charges of wizardry.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Olympian 8[/b]
	This is the one Olympian ode to a victor from Aegina,
	the island city for which Pindar composed more odes than
	for any other place. Alcimedon, a member of the Blepsiad
	clan, won the boys’ wrestling, probably in 460. Aegina
	boasted a rich mythological tradition associated with
	Aeacus and his sons (see genealogy of Aeacus in Appendix),
	four generations of whom were involved with Troy.
	Aeacus helped build its wall, Telamon was the first to sack
	it, Achilles and Ajax attacked it a second time, and
	Neoptolemus ultimately destroyed it. Pindar perhaps intends
	us to see a similar pattern in Alcimedon’s family that
	culminates in his Olympic victory.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Zeus, the patron god of the clan, figures prominently in
	the ode (3, 16, 21, 43, and 83). Because of the invocation
	of Olympia, many commentators have supposed that the
	ode was composed immediately after the victory and performed
	at Olympia, but the words “this island ”(25) and
	“here ”(51) indicate that it was performed on Aegina. The
	praise of Melesias is the most extensive tribute to a trainer
	in the odes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar invokes Olympia as the site of divination for
	aspiring athletes and requests that she welcome the
	present victory celebration (1–11). A summary priamel
	sketches the variety of human successes and singles out
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 134[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	Timosthenes (presumably the victor’s brother) for his victory
	at Nemea and Alcimedon for his Olympic victory (12–
	20). Aegina is then praised for its worship of Zeus Xenius,
	its fair dealing, and its hospitality to foreigners since the
	time of Aeacus (21–30). Poseidon and Apollo summoned
	Aeacus to help build Troy’s wall because the city was destined
	to fall at the place where a mortal had constructed
	the defense. When the wall was finished, two snakes failed
	to scale it, but a third succeeded. Apollo interpreted the
	omen to mean that Troy would be taken by the first and
	fourth generations of Aeacus’ children (31–46). Thereupon,
	Apollo went to the land of the Hyperboreans and
	Poseidon brought Aeacus to Aegina on his way to his Corinthian
	festival (46–52).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After observing that no one thing can please everyone,
	Pindar nonetheless expects that his forthcoming praise of
	Melesias will give no offense, because the trainer himself
	had won a Nemean victory as a boy and another as a man in
	the pancratium (53–59). He praises Melesias for his experience
	and skill as a teacher and declares that Alcimedon
	has gained for him his thirtieth victory in the major games;
	moreover, Alcimedon won the hard way, having to defeat
	four successive opponents (59–69). In so doing, he has
	cheered his aged grandfather and brought the Blepsiadae
	their sixth major victory (70–76). The boy’s achievement
	also brings joy to his dead father, Iphion, who, although in
	Hades, hears his name proclaimed and informs his relative
	Callimachus (77–84). The poem ends with prayers for
	Zeus to continue his bounty to the family and their city
	(84–88).

	[b]8. For Alcimedon Of Aegina[/b]
	<h2>
	winner, boys’ wrestling, 460 b.c.</h2>

	O mother of the golden-crowned games, Olympia,
	mistress of truth, where men who are seers
	examine burnt offerings and test
	Zeus of the bright thunderbolt,
	to see if he has any word concerning mortals
	[c dimgray]5[/c]who are striving in their hearts
	to gain a great success
	and respite from their toils;
	[m1]\ [/m]

	but men’s prayers are fulfilled in return for piety.
	O sanctuary of Pisa with beautiful trees on the Alpheus,
	[c dimgray]10[/c]receive this revel band and its wearing of crowns;
	for great fame is always his
	whom your illustrious prize attends.
	To different men come different
	blessings, and many are the paths
	to god-given success.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	Timosthenes,

	[b]Olympian 9[/b]
	Opus was a city of the Eastern Locrians, located north
	of Boeotia, whose early history Pindar briefly sketches in
	the poem. By winning this Olympic victory in 468 (confirmed
	by P. Oxy. 222), Epharmostus became a [c dimgray]periodonikēs[/c]
	(victor in all four crown games).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ode opens with a contrast between the spontaneous
	chant of Archilochus (a sort of “Hail to the Conquering
	Hero”), sung by Epharmostus’ friends at Olympia, and the
	more studied composition of the present ode, inspired
	by the Muses, with its extensive praise of the victor and
	of his city Opus for its orderly life and its athletic successes
	at Delphi and Olympia (1–20). The poet hopes to proclaim
	the Opuntians’ achievement with the aid of the Graces
	(20–27). The maxim that bravery and wisdom are divinely
	granted is illustrated by the example of Heracles, who held
	his own while fighting against three gods (28–35). But suddenly
	the poet rejects that story as boastfully disparaging
	of the gods and proposes as his theme the city of
	Protogeneia (Opus), first settled by Pyrrha and Deucalion,
	who came down from Mt. Parnassus and created a race of
	people from stones (35–46).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Implying that he is treating an old theme in a new song
	(47–49), Pindar begins with an account of the great flood
	and the establishment of a dynasty of native kings, which
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 148[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	continued until Zeus impregnated the daughter of Opus of
	Elis and gave her as a bride to Locrus, the childless king of
	the Locrian city (49–62), who named his adopted son Opus
	for the child’s maternal grandfather and handed the city
	over to him. His outstanding qualities attracted many immigrants,
	foremost of whom was Menoetius, whose son,
	Patroclus, stood by Achilles against the onslaught of Telephus
	(63–79).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After a brief prayer for inspiration (80–83), Pindar catalogs
	Epharmostus’ earlier victories, singling out his remarkable
	triumph in the games at Marathon, when he was
	taken from the class for youths (“beardless”) and made to
	compete against grown men. To the delight of the crowd,
	he won without losing a fall (83–99). Pindar concludes that
	natural abilities are better and more praiseworthy than
	learned ones that lack a divine component (100–107). Accordingly,
	he rejects the long and arduous ways of art in
	favor of a simple vaunt, declaring that Epharmostus has
	been favored by divine help and natural talent. The poem
	ends with an address to Ajax, son of Ileus, a local hero, on
	whose altar the victor is placing his crown (107–112).

	[b]Olympian 10[/b]
	Western (or Epizephyrian) Locri was located on the toe
	of Italy. The poet opens by asserting that he has forgotten
	his agreement to compose the ode. Since the victory (confirmed
	by P. Oxy. 222) was in 476, the same year that [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1,
	2, and 3 were composed for Hieron and Theron, it is likely
	that the more imposing commissions took precedence
	over this one for a boy victor. Pindar, however, promises interest
	(τόκος) on his overdue debt and atones with an especially
	rich ode that tells in loving detail of Heracles’
	founding of the Olympic games, the first contests held
	there, and the celebrations that followed. Indeed, its lateness
	makes it all the more appreciated for the immortality
	it confers on the victor.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Acknowledging that the ode is late, the poet invokes
	the Muse and Truth to help absolve him from blame (1–6).
	In recompense, he will pay interest on his debt by praising
	the Western Locrians, who appreciate strict dealing,
	poetry, and martial prowess (7–15). After a reference
	to Heracles’ difficulties in defeating Cycnus, he advises
	Hagesidamus to be grateful to his trainer Ilas, who sharpened
	his natural talents (15–21). Yet effort is also required
	for victory (22–23).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet is inspired by the ordinances of Zeus (probably
	those governing the festival in his honor) to tell of the
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 164[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	founding of the Olympic games by Heracles, established
	with the spoils he had taken when he destroyed the city
	of Augeas, who refused to pay Heracles for cleansing his
	stables (24–51). He recounts that the Fates and Time attended
	the initial festival, catalogs the winners of the si
	Xevents, and concludes with the festivities and victory songs
	that followed in the evening (52–77). Accordingly, the poet
	offers the present ode, which, although late, is all the
	more welcome—like a son finally born to an old man with
	no heirs (78–93). Pindar assures Hagesidamus that this
	ode will preserve his fame, reiterates his praise of the
	Western Locrians, and implies that through his verses
	Hagesidamus, like another Ganymede, will become immortal
	(93–105).

	[b]10. For Hagesidamus Of Western Locri[/b]
	<h2>
	winner, boys’ boxing, 476 b.c.</h2>

	Read me the name of the Olympic victor,
	the son of Archestratus, where it is written
	in my mind, for I owe
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] him a sweet song
	and have forgotten. O Muse, but you and Zeus’
	daughter,
	Truth, with a correcting hand
	[c dimgray]5[/c]ward off from me the charge of harming a guest friend
	with broken promises.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	For what was then the future has approached from afar
	and shamed my deep indebtedness.
	Nevertheless, interest on a debt can absolve one from
	a bitter reproach. Let him see
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] now:
	[c dimgray]10[/c]just as a flowing wave washes over a rolling pebble,
	so shall we pay back a theme of general concern
	as a friendly favor.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The opening strophe and antistrophe use the language of
	business (record-keeping, debts, interest, repayment) to discuss
	the lateness of this ode.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]I have accepted Fennell’s emendation for the MSS’s unmetrical
	θνατῶν (“mortals”); “him ”is Hagesidamus.

	and few have won without effort that joy
	which is a light for life above all deeds.
	But the ordinances of Zeus have prompted me to sing
	of the choice contest, which Heracles founded
	[c dimgray]25[/c]with its six altars
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] by the ancient tomb of Pelops,
	after he killed the son of Poseidon,

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Strictness (Ἀτρέκεια) may refer to the severe early lawcode
	of Zaleucus (schol.), but it also refers to the Locrians’ accuracy in
	business dealings.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]The scholia say that Pindar is following the account in Stesichorus’
	[c dimgray]Cycnus[/c] ([c dimgray]fr.[/c] 207 Campbell), which must have differed
	from the version at \[Hes.\] [c dimgray]Scutum[/c] 57\[n-dash\]423. The particular incident referred to is not known, nor is the following one about Patroclus
	and Achilles, which probably derives from the cyclic tradition.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]Hagesidamus’ trainer (schol.).
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]The image is one of a whetstone. In lines 20–22 Pindar
	adumbrates four elements required for success: natural ability,
	training, divine assistance, and effort.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]I have printed βωμῶν (AEi) against the meter; the reference
	is to the six double altars dedicated to the twelve gods worshiped
	at Olympia (cf. 49 and [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 5.5). Some read Christ’s πόνων “with si
	Xtoils ”as a reference to the six events listed in 64–72.

	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]
	had destroyed his army of Tirynthians

	in the valleys of Elis. And indeed, not long afterwards,

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Olympian 11[/b]
	This poem commemorates the same event as the previous
	one, and their relationship has long been debated. The
	scholia claim that [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 11 was written to pay the interest on
	the debt mentioned in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 10, while many modern editors
	(e.g., Dissen, Gildersleeve, Fennell, and Farnell) have followed
	Boeckh in reversing the order of the two odes on
	the supposition that [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 11 was performed immediately at
	Olympia and that it promises the longer ode ([c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 10). The
	latter view gains some support from the poet’s statement at
	[c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 10.100 that he saw Hagesidamus win at Olympia, but
	neither poem makes an explicit reference to the other.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poem opens with a priamel in which the needs of
	sailors for winds and of farmers for rain are capped by the
	need of victors for commemorative songs (1–6). In a brief
	[c dimgray]praeteritio[/c] (recognized as such by E. L. Bundy), the poet
	asserts that much can be said in praise of Olympic victors,
	and that he is eager to praise at length, but declines to do
	so by saying that with divine help and poetic skill he can
	succeed just as effectively with a succinct account (7–10).
	He briefly states Hagesidamus’ achievement and offers to
	grace his Olympic crown by honoring the people of Western
	Locri (11–15). The poet dispatches the Muses to the
	celebration there (i.e. in Western Locri) and praises the
	Locrians for their hospitality, good taste, intelligence, and
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 178[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	martial prowess (16–19). He assures the Muses that they
	will find the Locrians as he has described them, for no
	more than foxes or lions could they change their nature
	(19–20).

	[b]Olympian 12[/b]
	Exiled from Cnossos by political unrest, Ergoteles settled
	in Himera on the north coast of Sicily and went on to
	become a double [c dimgray]periodonikēs[/c] in the dolichos (Paus.
	6.4.11). The bronze inscription for his statue was discovered
	at Olympia in 1953, and is dated to 464 or later
	(Ebert, #20). When this ode was composed (most likely
	in 466), he was in mid-career and had not yet won his
	second Olympic victory. The city of Himera had recently
	been freed from the control of Acragas by Hieron, perhaps
	occasioning the epithet of Deliverer for Zeus (1).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet invokes Tyche (Fortune) as a savior goddess,
	daughter of Zeus the Deliverer, and asks her to protect
	Himera (1–2). After describing her powers over sailing,
	war, and assemblies, he states that men’s hopes are often
	fulfilled, but at other times prove vain (3–6a). No human
	can know with certainty what the gods have in store for the
	future (7–9), and many things turn out contrary to men’s
	best judgment: sometimes they are unpleasant, but at
	other times distress can turn to great happiness (10–12a).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The career of Ergoteles exemplifies adversity proving
	to be a blessing, for if he had not been exiled from Cnossos,
	he would not have become a celebrated Panhellenic runner
	(13–16). Now a victor at Olympia, Delphi, and the
	Isthmus, he glorifies his new home (17–19).

	[c darkmagenta][b]PINDAR, Olympian Odes[/b][/c]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Olympian 13[/b]
	The ode opens with Τρισολυμπιονίκαν (“thrice victorious
	at Olympia”), an imposing compound coined for the
	occasion that fills the first verse. It is warranted because
	Thessalus, the father of the victor, had won the stadion at
	Olympia, while Xenophon achieved the singular feat of
	winning both the stadion and the pentathlon in the same
	Olympiad. His unique achievement reflects the inventiveness
	of his city, Corinth, for it is credited with the discovery
	of the dithyramb, the bridle and bit, and temple
	decorations. Pindar illustrates Corinthian ingenuity with
	the examples of Sisyphus and Medea, but chooses as his
	central narrative the discovery of the bridle and bit by
	Bellerophon. The athletic success of Xenophon and his
	clan, the Oligaethidae, is extraordinary: Pindar credits
	them with sixty victories at Nemea and the Isthmus alone.
	Pindar also wrote a scolion for Xenophon, twenty lines of
	which are preserved as [c dimgray]fr[/c]. 122.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This family with three Olympic victories that is both
	kind to citizens and hospitable to foreigners reflects the
	qualities of its city, Corinth, where the three Horae (Order,
	Justice, and Peace) dwell (1–10). The poet says that he
	will boldly proclaim his praise of the Corinthians, including
	their athletic triumphs, inventiveness, and love of the
	Muse and Ares (11–23). He prays that Olympian Zeus
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 190[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	continue to bless them with good fortune and receive this celebration
	of Xenophon’s unprecedented double victory at
	Olympia (24–31). There follows an impressive catalog of
	Xenophon’s and his family’s athletic achievements, concluded
	by the poet’s statement that he cannot enumerate
	all their victories at Delphi and Nemea, since moderation
	should be observed (32–48).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After announcing that he will embark on a public
	theme, Pindar praises Corinth for its heroes of the intellect,
	Sisyphus and Medea, before passing on to the Trojan
	war, in which Corinthians fought on both sides, and finally
	singling out Glaucus the Lycian, whose ancestor was Bellerophon
	(49–62). An extensive narrative tells of Bellerophon’s
	discovery of the bridle and bit through the help of
	Athena, his exploits with Pegasus, and his ultimate fate,
	details of which the poet will not provide (63–92).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet aims his javelins of praise at the victor’s clan,
	the Oligaethidae, and provides a catalog of their athletic
	victories that includes so many items he must swim away as
	if out of a sea (93–114). The poem ends with a prayer to
	Zeus to grant them esteem and success (114–115).

	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]
	Sons of Aletes,
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] upon you have the Horae rich in flowers
	often bestowed the splendor of victory,
	[c dimgray]15[/c]when you prevailed with loftiest achievements
	in the sacred games,
	and often have they put into the hearts of your men
	[m1]\ [/m]

	inventions of long ago.
	All credit belongs to the discoverer.
	Whence did the delights of Dionysus appear
	with the ox-driving dithyramb?
	[c dimgray]20[/c]Who then added the restrainer to the horse’s gear
	or the twin kings of birds to the temples
	of the gods?
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] There flourishes the sweet-voiced Muse;
	there thrives Ares
	with the young men’s deadly spears.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	Most exalted, wide-ruling lord
	[c dimgray]25[/c]of Olympia, may you not begrudge my words
	for all time to come, father Zeus,
	and, as you guide this people free from harm,
	direct the wind of Xenophon’s fortune,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]The gnome applies both to Pindar’s forthright character and
	to the natural ability of the Corinthians, about to be praised.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]Aletes was an early Dorian king of Corinth.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]According to Hdt. 1.23, Arion of Methymna invented the
	dithyramb and taught it in Corinth. It is called ox-driving because oxen served as prizes and were sacrificed during the festival. The
	Corinthians initiated the placement of eagles as finials at the ape
	Xof each end of the Doric temple (a schol. claims, however, that
	Pindar is referring to the pediments, ἀετώματα, so-called because
	they supposedly resemble an eagle’s outstretched wings).
	The discovery of the bridle and bit will be the subject of the forthcoming
	narrative.

	In each matter there comes

	But I, as a private individual embarked upon a public
	[c dimgray]50[/c]mission,
	proclaiming their ancestors’ intelligence
	and warfare amidst heroic achievements,
	shall tell no lies about Corinth in citing Sisyphus,
	most shrewd in cleverness like a god,
	and Medea, who in opposition to her father
	made her own marriage,
	to become the savior of the ship Argo and its crew;

	[c dimgray]56[/c]before the walls of Dardanus, they gained the reputation
	on both sides for determining the outcome of battles,

	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]
	to recover Helen, and those who at every turn were trying
	[c dimgray]60[/c]to prevent them: for the Danaans trembled before
	Glaucus who came from Lycia. And to them

	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] were the kingship

	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c]I.e. Agamemnon and Menelaus. The Corinthians were under

	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]Corinth, where the fountain of Pirene is located.
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]This account of Bellerophon is based loosely on the speech
	of Glaucus at [c dimgray]Il[/c]. 6.153–211, where the descent is Bellerophon–

	[b]Pindar[/b]

	[b]Olympian 14[/b]
	This is the only ode to a victor from Orchomenus (Erchomenus
	in Boeotian spelling) and consists mainly of a
	hymn to the Graces (Χάριτες), associated with the city
	from ancient times (Paus. 9.35.1–7). Since the date of 476
	given by the scholia is not confirmed by P. Oxy. 222, the
	poem is usually ascribed to 488, the date most likely to
	have been altered by a scribal error (cf. Gaspar 50). According
	to the scholia the event (not indicated in the
	poem) was the stadion in the boys’ category. It is the only
	ode to consist of just two strophes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet invokes the Graces as guardians of
	Orchomenus and providers of all pleasure for mortals
	(1–7). They are also present at the gods’ festivals and
	seated beside Apollo (8–12). In the second strophe the
	poet re-invokes them by name as Aglaia (Splendor),
	Euphrosyne (Good Cheer), and Thalia (Festivity) and, because
	she helped bring it about, asks the last of these to
	look kindly upon the present celebration of Asopichus’
	Olympic victory (13–20). The sudden appearance of the
	word μελαντειχέα (“black-walled”) casts a shadow over
	the so-far joyful ode, as the poet asks Echo to convey the
	news of the young man’s victory to his dead father in Hades
	(20–24).

	[b]Pythian 1[/b]
	Upon winning the chariot race at the Pythian games in
	470, Hieron, ruler of Syracuse, was announced as a citizen
	of Aetna, thereby publicizing his founding of that city in
	476/5 with 5,000 settlers from Syracuse and 5,000 from
	the Peloponnesus (Diod. Sic. 11.49). The ode celebrates
	that founding in a broader context of harmonious peace,
	achieved in the polis by good governance, maintained
	against foreign aggression by resolute warfare, and, on a
	cosmic scale, gained and held against the forces of disorder
	by Zeus’ power, exemplified by Typhos’ confinement
	under Mt. Aetna.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There has been much discussion concerning the campaign
	alluded to in lines 50–55, where Hieron is compared
	to Philoctetes. One scholion (99a) says that it is Hieron’s
	intervention on behalf ofWestern Locri against Anaxilas of
	Rhegium in 477 (cf. [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 2.18–20), while many modern
	scholars have argued that it is Hieron’s defeat of
	Thrasydaeus of Acragas in 472. Most likely it is his victory
	at Cyme in 474, treated in lines 72–75.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poem opens with a hymn to the Lyre, which has the
	power to pacify Zeus’ thunderbolt and eagle and calm the
	spirits of Ares and the other gods (1–12). The effect of the
	Muses’ song on Zeus’ enemies is one of terror, especially
	on Typhos, who, pinned down under Cyme (near Mt. Vesuvius)
	and Aetna, sends up eruptions of lava in his
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 216[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	tormented frustration (13–28). In the first of several prayers
	articulating the poem (cf. 39, 46, 58, 63, 68, and 71), the
	poet asks for Zeus’ favor and tells of Hieron’s victory in the
	Pythian chariot race, which he considers a promising sign
	of the city’s future success (29–38).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Using an analogy from javelin throwing, the poet expresses
	a hope that he will outdistance his rivals in praising
	Hieron (41–45), whose family has gained unsurpassed glory
	in warfare (46–50), while he himself, like Philoctetes, was
	summoned to campaign although ill (50–55).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	An address to the Muse turns attention to Hieron’s son,
	Deinomenes, the titular king of Aetna (58–60). The city
	was founded in the political tradition established by the
	Dorian conquest of Greece (61–66); Zeus is asked to assist
	its rulers in maintaining peace (67–70).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet prays that the Carthaginians and Etruscans
	will remain peaceful (71–72), now that the latter have suffered
	defeat by Hieron at Cyme (72–75). A brief priamel
	cites the Athenian victory at Salamis and the Spartan victory
	at Plataea, and concludes with the Deinomenid victory
	at Himera against the Carthaginians (75–80).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The final triad turns to Hieron’s civic governance, prefaced
	by a concern that lengthy praise can cause tedium or
	resentment (81–84). Citing the proverb “envy (for success)
	is better than pity (for failure), ”the poet couches his praise
	in a series of exhortations to Hieron recommending justice,
	truthfulness, accountability, and generosity (85–94).
	Two rulers from the previous century are cited as positive
	and negative examples: Croesus is well remembered for
	his generosity, whereas Phalaris’ cruelty is abominated
	(94–98). Best of all is success combined with fame (99–
	100).

	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c]Philoctetes, son of Poeas, was bitten on the foot by a snake at

	could not stand his suffering and abandoned him on

	[b]Pythian 2[/b]

	[c dimgray]Pythian[/c] 2 is one of the most difficult Pindaric odes
	to interpret. The venue of the chariot victory is not specified,
	and none of the possibilities proposed by the scholia
	(Delphi, Nemea, Athens, and Olympia) or by modern
	scholars (Thebes and Syracuse) is compelling. Furthermore,
	if the poem’s one historical allusion in 18–20 refers
	(as the scholia claim) to Hieron’s protection of Western
	Locri against Anaxilas of Rhegium in 477, then it merely
	provides a [c dimgray]terminus post quem[/c] for the poem’s composition.
	Another difficulty is that the extensive narrative of Ixion’s
	ingratitude and punishment seems excessively negative for
	a celebratory ode; in contrast, in [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 1 Tantalus’ malfeasance
	is counterbalanced by Pelops’ heroic achievement.
	The meaning of the allusions to this poem as “Phoenician
	merchandise ”(67) and a “Castor song ”(69) remains unclear.
	Finally, the unparalleled concluding section beginning
	at 69 warns against the dangers posed by slanderers,
	flatterers, and envious men in a series of rapidly shifting
	images that contain many obscure details.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet says that he comes from Thebes to Syracuse,
	bringing news of Hieron’s chariot victory, in which he was
	assisted by Artemis, Hermes, and Poseidon (1–12). In a
	summary priamel Pindar notes that many kings have been
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 234[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	praised for their achievements and gives two examples:
	Cinyras of Cyprus and Hieron (13–20).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Ixion, as he turns on his wheel, advises mortals to repay
	benefactors (21–24), a lesson he learned when, despite
	his happy life with the immortals, he tried to rape Hera.
	Zeus deceived him by fashioning a cloud that looked like
	Hera, and for his punishment bound him to a four-spoke
	wheel (25–41). Meanwhile, the cloud bore Centaurus,
	who mated with Magnesian mares and sired the Centaurs
	(42–48). The narrative concludes with the observation that
	the gods fulfill all their designs (49–52).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet states that he must avoid being a censurer
	like Archilochus; instead, he takes god-given wealth as his
	theme (52–56). Hieron provides him a clear example,
	whom no Greek has ever surpassed in wealth or honor
	(57–61). He is extolled for his glorious military campaigns
	and for his mature wisdom (62–67).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After bidding Hieron farewell in the style of hymns,
	the poet compares his poem thus far to Phoenician merchandise
	(perhaps because it is of high quality and was
	paid for) and asks Hieron to look favorably upon the forthcoming
	Castor song (67–71). He urges Hieron to imitate
	Rhadamanthys and not be deceived by slanderers (72–78).
	The poet declares himself above such behavior (79–80),
	and abjures deceitful flattery, being instead a straightforward
	friend or foe of a sort that excels under every form
	of government (81–88). Envious men are not satisfied with
	god-given success and injure themselves by their own
	schemes (88–92). We must accept the constraints of our
	situation, for resisting is futile; the poet hopes to enjoy the
	company of good men (93–96).

	[b]2. For Hieron Of Syracuse[/b]
	<h2>
	winner, chariot race</h2>

	O great city of Syracuse, sanctuary of
	Ares mighty in war, divine nourisher of men
	and horses delighting in steel,
	to you I come from shining Thebes bearing this song
	and its news of the four-horse chariot that shakes the
	earth,
	[c dimgray]5[/c]in which Hieron, possessor of fine chariots, prevailed
	and with far-shining garlands crowned Ortygia,
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	abode of the river goddess Artemis, with whose help
	he mastered in his gentle hands
	those fillies with their embroidered reins,
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]

	because with both hands the virgin archeress
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]10[/c]and Hermes, lord of the games, place on them the shining
	harness, whenever he yokes the strong horses
	to the polished car and to the chariot that controls the bit,
	and calls upon the wide-ruling god who wields the
	trident.

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The language perhaps indicates that Hieron closely
	supervised the training of the team, not that he himself drove it; rich men retained their own charioteers (cf. [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 5.26–53). The
	only mention of a victor driving his own chariot is at [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 1.15.

	these words to mortals as he turns
	in every direction on his winged wheel:

	with deeds of gentle recompense.

	He learned this clearly, for having won a pleasant
	existence
	[c dimgray]26[/c]among Cronus’ beneficent children, he could not sustain
	his happiness for long, when in his maddened mind
	he fell in love with Hera, who belonged to Zeus for joyous

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Pythian 3[/b]
	The occasion of this ode is not a recent victory, but
	Hieron’s illness. The poem was probably classed among
	the epinicia by the Alexandrian editors because of the
	passing mention of a former Pythian victory won by
	Hieron’s horse Pherenicus (73–74). It was composed
	sometime between 476, when Hieron founded Aetna (cf.
	69), and 467, when he died.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The first 79 lines comprise an elaborate sequence in
	ring form that begins with the poet’s impossible wish that
	Chiron were still alive and ends with his stated intention to
	pray to the Mother Goddess, presumably for Hieron’s
	health. In between, he tells the stories of Coronis, mother
	of Asclepius, and of Asclepius himself, narratives that show
	the dire consequences of discontent with one’s lot and motivate
	some of Pindar’s best known verses: “Do not, my
	soul, strive for the life of the immortals . . . ”(61–62). The
	last part of the ode (80–115) offers consolation to Hieron.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet wishes that Chiron the Centaur still lived
	on Pelion, as when he raised the healer Asclepius (1–7).
	Coronis was killed by Artemis before giving birth to Asclepius,
	Apollo’s son, because she slept with Ischys the
	Arcadian after becoming pregnant with the god’s child—
	she was like many who foolishly despise what is nearby
	and seek what is distant and futile (8–23). When Apollo
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 248[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	learned of her perfidy, he sent Artemis to cause a plague
	that killed her and many others, but rescued his son from
	her body as it lay on the burning pyre and gave him to
	Chiron to instruct in medicine (24–46). Asclepius was a
	very successful healer, but when he fell prey to the allure
	of gold and brought a man back to life, Zeus destroyed
	patient and physician with a thunderbolt (47–58).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Mortals should know their limits, and the poet urges his
	soul to be content with what is in its power (59–62). If,
	however, Chiron were alive, and if Pindar could have
	charmed him with his songs to provide another Asclepius,
	he would have come to Syracuse, bringing Hieron health
	and a victory celebration as in the past (63–76). But as it is,
	he will offer his prayers to the Mother Goddess (77–79).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar reminds Hieron of what former poets (i.e.
	Homer) have taught: that the gods grant two evils for each
	good. Fools find this hard to bear, but good men make the
	best of their good fortune (80–83). As a ruler, Hieron has
	had a great portion of happiness (84–86). Not even Peleus
	and Cadmus, whose weddings were attended by the gods,
	experienced unlimited good; they suffered through the
	misfortunes of their offspring (86–103). A man must make
	do with what the gods give him, for nothing remains constant
	(103–106). In a series of first person statements of
	general import, the poet declares that he shall be small
	or great, depending on fortune, but hopes to use what
	wealth he has to gain fame (107–111). The names of
	Nestor and Sarpedon endure through epic poetry; few are
	those whose excellence is preserved in song (112–115).

	I wish that Chiron—
	if it is right for my tongue to utter
	that common prayer—
	were still living, the departed son of Philyra
	and wide-ruling offspring of Uranus’ son Cronus,
	and still reigned in Pelion’s glades, that wild creature
	[c dimgray]5[/c]who had a mind friendly to men. I would have him be
	as he was when he once reared the gentle craftsman
	of body-strengthening relief from pain, Asclepius,
	the hero and protector from diseases of all sorts.

	Before the daughter
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] of the horseman Phlegyas
	could bring him to term with the help of Eleithyia,

	[c dimgray]10[/c]by the golden arrows of Artemis

	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]It is not clear why Pindar prays to the Mother of the
	gods. Magna Mater (Rhea, Cybele, or perhaps Demeter), or what his relatiohship to her was. The scholiasts, biographers, and Pausanias (9.25.3) all claim that Pindar had a shrine to her and
	Pan by his house.
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]Cf. [c dimgray]Il[/c]. 24.527–528: δοιοὶ γάρ τε πίθοι κατακείαται ἐν Διὸς
	οὔδει | δώρων οἷα δίδωσι κακῶν, ἕτερος δὲ ἑάων. Pindar interprets
	the text to mean that there were two urns of evil gifts and
	one of good. Most scholars follow Plato’s interpretation, according
	to which only two urns are at issue ([c dimgray]Rep[/c]. 379D).
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]That is, by letting people see only the good (cf. [c dimgray]fr[/c]. 42).

	Your share of happiness attends you,

	[c dimgray]90[/c]the golden-crowned Muses singing on the mountain and

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Pythian 4[/b]
	Arcesilas IV was the eighth ruler in a dynasty that began
	with Battus I, who colonized Cyrene from Thera c.
	630 b.c. Under the Battidae, the city became a powerful
	commercial center, whose main export, an extract from a
	plant known as silphium, had medicinal properties. Since
	Cyrene was also famous for its doctors, the many references
	to healing in this poem are especially appropriate.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ode is by far the longest in the collection, owing to
	its epic-like narrative of Jason’s quest for the golden fleece,
	a topic relevant to Arcesilas because the Battidae claimed
	Euphamus, one of the Argonauts, as their ancestor. A surprising
	feature is the plea at the end for Arcesilas to take
	back Damophilus, a young Cyrenaean living in exile. The
	closing remark about Damophilus’ discovery of a spring of
	verses while being hosted in Thebes suggests that he commissioned
	the ode. The date of the victory was 462; within
	a few years Arcesilas was deposed and his dynasty came to
	an end.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Muse is asked to celebrate Arcesilas and Apollo,
	who had once prophesied that Battus would colonize
	Libya and fulfill Medea’s prediction uttered seventeen
	generations before (1–11). Medea’s words to the Argonauts
	are quoted at length (11–56). Pindar announces his
	intention to sing of Arcesilas, victorious at Pytho, and of
	the golden fleece (64–69).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	An oracle had warned Pelias to beware of a man with
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 264[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	one sandal (71–78). When Jason arrives in the agora at
	Iolcus, his appearance stuns the onlookers (78–92). Pelias
	hastens to meet him and Jason declares that he has come
	to reclaim the kingship Pelias had usurped from Jason’s
	father. He recounts that when he was born his parents
	feigned his death and sent him to be raised by Chiron (93–
	119). After celebrating with his relatives, Jason goes with
	them to confront Pelias (120–136). Jason offers to let
	Pelias retain the herds and property, but asks for the scepter
	and throne (136–155). Pelias agrees, but requests that
	Jason first bring back the golden fleece (156–167).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Many heroes, inspired by Hera, join Jason and the expedition
	sets sail (171–202). After passing through the
	Symplegades, they reach Colchis, where Aphrodite devises
	the iynx for Jason to seduce Medea (203–219). With
	Medea’s help, Jason accomplishes the task set by her father,
	Aeetes, of plowing with the fire-breathing bulls (220–
	241). Aeetes tells Jason where the golden fleece is kept,
	but does not expect him to retrieve it, because it is guarded
	by a huge serpent (241–246).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pressed for time, the poet briefly recounts that after Jason
	slew the serpent the Argonauts slept with the women
	on Lemnos on their way home. From this union came the
	race of Euphamus, Arcesilas’ ancestors, who eventually
	colonized Libya (247–262).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	To lead up to the mention of Damophilus, the poet
	proposes an allegory for Arcesilas to ponder: an oak tree
	stripped of its boughs can still perform service as firewood
	or as a beam (263–269). Arcesilas has an opportunity
	to heal the wounds of his disordered city (270–276). The
	poet reminds Arcesilas of the virtues of Damophilus, who
	wishes to return in peace to Cyrene, bringing the song he
	found while a guest at Thebes (277–299).

	Today, Muse, you must stand beside a man who is a

	so that while Arcesilas is celebrating
	you may swell the breeze of hymns
	owed to Leto’s children
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and to Pytho,
	where long ago the priestess who sits beside the golden
	[c dimgray]6[/c]eagles of Zeus
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] prophesied when Apollo was not away
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]
	that Battus would be the colonizer
	of fruit-bearing Libya, and that
	he should at once leave the holy island
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] to found a city
	of fine chariots on the white breast of a hill,
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]

	and to fulfill in the seventeenth generation that word
	[c dimgray]10[/c]spoken on Thera by Medea,

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Artemis and Apollo, the patron god of Delphi (Pytho).
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The priestess who spoke the oracles was known as the Pythia. Strabo (9.3.6) reports that Pindar had told how Zeus released two
	eagles from east and west that came together at the center of the
	world, where the “navel ”at Delphi was located.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Apollo visited other cult centers, including the Hyperboreans
	(cf. [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 10.34–36); his presence would assure the efficacy
	of the oracle.

	against the ship. Before that, we had drawn up
	the sea-faring bark from Oceanus in accordance

	At that point the solitary god approached us,

	of Chiron, for I come
	from the side of Chariclo and Philyra
	[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c] and from the cave
	where the Centaur’s holy daughters raised me.
	After completing twenty years without doing
	[c dimgray]105[/c]or saying anything untoward to them, I have come
	home to reclaim my father’s ancient honor
	of kingship, now being wielded
	unjustly, which long ago Zeus granted
	to Aeolus, leader of the people, and to his sons,
	[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]

	for I am told that lawless Pelias
	gave in to his white wits
	[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c]
	[c dimgray]110[/c]and usurped it
	by force from my justly ruling parents,
	who, as soon as I saw the light,
	fearing the violence of the overbearing ruler,
	made a dark funeral
	in the house and added women’s wailing as if I had died,
	but secretly sent me away in my purple swaddling clothes,
	[c dimgray]115[/c]and, entrusting the journey to the night, gave me
	to Chiron, son of Cronus, to raise.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c]Chariclo was Chiron’s wife, Philyra his mother.
	[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c]See Appendix, genealogy of Aeolus. Tyro was married to her
	uncle Cretheus, thus making Aeson and Pelias half-brothers.
	[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c]The meaning of the phrase is in doubt. Glosses include
	“evil ”(Hesychius), “shallow ”(schol.), or “empty ”(schol.).

	But now you know the principal elements of my story.
	Dear fellow citizens, show me clearly
	the home of my fathers who rode white horses,
	for I come here as the son of Aeson, a native,
	to no strangers’ land.
	The divine creature called me by the name Jason.”
	[c dimgray]120[/c]Thus he spoke. When he entered his home, his father’s
	eyes recognized him and then tears burst forth
	from under his aged eyelids,
	as he rejoiced in his soul to see his extraordinary
	offspring, fairest of men.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	Both of his father’s brothers
	[c dimgray]125[/c]arrived when they heard the news about him: Pheres
	came from the nearby Hyperian spring
	[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c]
	and Amythaon came from Messene; Admetus
	and Melampus also came quickly,
	out of good will, to their cousin. During the feasting
	Jason received them with gentle words
	and, providing fitting hospitality,
	extended all manner of festivity
	[c dimgray]130[/c]for five whole nights and days, culling
	the sacred excellence of joyous living.

	But on the sixth day, the hero laid out in earnest
	the whole story from the beginning
	and shared it with his relatives,

	[c dimgray]135[/c]They hastened straight in and took a stand. When he

	[c dimgray]165[/c]Willingly accomplish this task and I swear

	[b]Pythian 5[/b]
	This ode celebrates the same Pythian chariot victory as
	the preceding poem, but is a much more straightforward
	encomium of Arcesilas. The winter storm briefly mentioned
	in line 10 probably refers to the political turmoil
	associated with Damophilus’ exile treated in [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4. The
	praise of the driver Carrhotus is the most extensive tribute
	to a charioteer in the odes. The scholia report that he
	was Arcesilas’ brother-in-law, but there is no independent
	evidence to confirm this. The poem appears to have been
	performed during the Carneian festival for Apollo, who
	figures very prominently in the ode (as he does in the other
	two odes to Cyrenaeans, [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4 and 9). At the end of the
	poem Pindar prays for an Olympic victory. According to a
	scholion on [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4 (inscr. b, 2.92.11 Dr.) Arcesilas won an
	Olympic victory in 460, but sometime afterward he was
	killed in a democratic revolution and his dynasty came to
	an end.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Wealth is powerful when divinely granted and used
	virtuously to make friends (1–4). Such is true in the case of
	Arcesilas, who has been favored by Castor, the patron of
	chariot racing (5–11). A wise and just king, he is blessed
	with the present celebration of his victory at Pytho (12–
	23), earned by his charioteer Carrhotus, who kept his char-
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 306[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	iot unscathed (while forty other drivers fell) and dedicated
	it in a shrine at Delphi (23–53).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Although no individual is free from adversity, the prosperity
	of Battus continues to bless Cyrene (54–57). A catalog
	of Apollo’s powers indirectly lists his benefactions to
	the city: as colony founder who aided Battus; as healing
	god who provides medicinal remedies; as god of poetry
	who fosters peaceful order; and as oracular god who
	helped settle the Dorians in the Peloponnesus (57–72).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet states that his forefathers, the Spartan Aegeidae,
	colonized Thera, whence derives the present Carneian
	festival (72–81). The colonists from Thera still honor
	an earlier group of settlers, the sons of Antenor, who came
	from Troy after its destruction (82–88). The poet relates
	that Battus enlarged the city’s sanctuaries and built a paved
	road for processions in honor of Apollo (89–93); he surmises
	that Battus and the successive kings in their tombs
	along the way share in this celebration of their offspring,
	Arcesilas (93–107).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar praises Arcesilas by briefly recounting what everyone
	says: he is wise, courageous, appreciative of poetry,
	and an expert in chariot racing; he has sought all the distinctions
	his homeland offers (107–117). Pindar prays that
	Arcesilas’ success may continue and that Zeus may grant
	him a chariot victory in the Olympic games (117–124).

	<h2>
	winner, chariot race, 462 b.c.</h2>

	Wealth has wide strength,
	when, conjoined with flawless excellence,
	a mortal man receives it from destiny and takes it
	as a companion which brings many friends.
	[c dimgray]5[/c]O Arcesilas, favored by heaven,
	truly have you, from the very first steps
	of your glorious life,
	been seeking it along with fame,
	thanks to Castor of the golden chariot,
	[c dimgray]10[/c]who, after a winter rainstorm, sheds fair weather
	over your blessed hearth.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	Truly, wise men sustain more nobly
	even their god-given power.
	And as you travel the path of justice, great prosperity
	surrounds you:
	[c dimgray]15[/c]first, because you are king
	of great cities
	(since that privilege, most venerable
	when combined with your understanding,

	[b]Pythian 6[/b]
	Although the occasion of the ode is a Pythian chariot
	victory (also mentioned at [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2.49–51) won by Xenocrates
	of Acragas, younger brother of Theron, probably in 490
	b.c., most of the poem is devoted to praise of his son
	Thrasybulus. A tradition going back to the scholia claims
	that Thrasybulus drove the chariot, but this is probably
	fabricated to explain his prominence in the poem. [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 2,
	composed after Xenocrates’ death, also contains extended
	praise of Thrasybulus.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The opening lines suggest that the poem is meant to accompany
	a procession to Apollo’s temple at Delphi, whose
	way was lined with treasuries belonging to various cities
	(the Athenians’ has been reconstructed), but as the poem
	continues, the actual treasuries are replaced by a metaphorical
	storehouse of songs (cf. [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 6.1–4 for another example
	of a poem portrayed as a building).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet invokes Aphrodite and the Graces as he approaches
	Apollo’s temple (1–4). Here a treasury of Pythian
	hymns has been erected for the Emmenidae of Acragas
	and for Xenocrates, one which neither rain nor wind can
	destroy (5–14), and whose façade proclaims the victory of
	Thrasybulus’ father (14–18).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The remainder of the poem contains praise of Thrasybulus
	for following the counsel that Chiron gave to
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 322[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	Achilles, namely to honor Zeus and one’s parents (19–27). A
	brief narrative in ring composition recounts how
	Antilochus gave his life to save his father from Memnon’s
	attack (28–43). In the present generation Thrasybulus
	comes closest to the ideal of such filial devotion (44–45).
	He emulates his uncle Theron, uses his wealth intelligently,
	is not insolent, enjoys poetry, is devoted to horse
	racing, and makes a pleasant companion (46–54).

	Although this is the shortest ode in the collection, it is to
	an important man, Megacles, son of Hippocrates, nephew
	and son-in-law of the legislator Cleisthenes, and uncle of
	Pericles, all members of a prominent Athenian family, the
	Alcmaeonidae. Megacles’ great-grandfather Alcmaeon
	had won an Olympic chariot victory in 592 b.c. (alluded to
	in 14–15; cf. Hdt. 6.125). In 548 the Alcmaeonidae restored
	the burned temple of Apollo at Delphi with a bright
	façade of Parian marble (Hdt. 5.62). At the time of this
	ode, probably 486, Megacles was in exile after his ostracism
	from Athens the previous year (cf. Arist. [c dimgray]Ath. Pol.[/c]
	22.5).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Athens provides the best opening for an ode, because it
	and the Alcmaeonidae are the most celebrated city and
	family in Hellas (1–8). All Greece knows of their reconstruction
	of Apollo’s temple (9–12). The family boasts five
	Isthmian, one Olympic, and two Pythian victories (13–
	17a). Although the poet rejoices in the family’s success, he
	is saddened by the envy that has been directed against
	Megacles and consoles him by pointing out that abiding
	prosperity is subject to vicissitudes (18–21).

	<h2>

	The great city of Athens is the fairest prelude
	to lay down as a foundation for songs to honor
	the mighty race of the Alcmaeonidae for their horses.
	For what fatherland, what house can you inhabit and

	None, for among all cities travels the report
	[c dimgray]10[/c]about Erechtheus’ citizens,
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Apollo, who made
	your temple in divine Pytho splendid to behold.
	Five victories at the Isthmus prompt me, as does one

	and two victories at Cirrha,

	[b]Pythian 8[/b]
	If the scholiastic headnote is correct, the date of Aristomenes’
	victory is 446, making this the latest ode in the
	collection. There has been much speculation on the ode’s
	historical circumstances, especially the troubled relations
	between Aegina and Athens, but it must remain mere
	speculation, since the poem contains no overt reference to
	Athens.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A puzzling feature is the poet’s statement that Alcman
	was his neighbor, the guardian of his possessions, and had
	prophesied to him as he traveled to Delphi (58–60). From
	the time of the scholia questions have arisen about the
	content of the prophecy (was it a prediction of Aristomenes’
	victory?) and, more importantly, whether the poet is
	speaking in his own person or for the chorus. Either choice
	involves difficulties; on balance a slightly stronger case can
	be made for the poet as speaker.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A recurrent theme in the ode is the alternation of failure
	and success, evident in the narrative, in which the
	disaster of Adrastus’ first expedition against Thebes is followed
	by the success ten years later of a second, though at
	the cost of his son’s life; in the description of the four defeated
	athletes’ homecoming; and in the famous concluding
	lines on the fragility of the human condition (“a dream
	of a shadow”). The address, ù paÍ (33), and the reference
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 336[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	to “mother ”(85) point to Aristomenes’ youthfulness, but
	there is no clear indication that his victory was in the boys’
	division.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ode opens with a hymn to Hesychia (Peace, Concord)
	(1–5). She fosters gentleness, but when provoked,
	she is a formidable adversary, as Porphyrion and Typhos
	discovered (6–20).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The island of Aegina is celebrated for its heroes, the
	Aeacidae, and for its men (21–28), but the poet declines
	to go into detail about them (29–32). Instead, he praises
	Aristomenes, who, by imitating his uncles’ success in athletics,
	merits what Amphiaraus prophesied as the Epigoni
	were fighting before Thebes (32–42). After noting
	that sons inherit their fathers’ determination, as in the
	case of his own son Alcman, Amphiaraus predicted that
	Adrastus would be victorious, but would lose his son (43–
	55). Alcman is praised for prophesying to the poet on his
	way to Delphi (56–60).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar mentions victories granted to Aristomenes by
	Apollo in his festivals at Pytho and on Aegina, and asks for
	the gods’ continued favor (61–72). If men are successful
	without great effort, many think them wise, but in fact the
	gods determine who prevails (73–77).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After listing Aristomenes’ victories at Megara, Marathon,
	and Aegina, the poet depicts the unhappy homecoming
	of the four opponents he defeated at Delphi (78–87).
	Unlike them, the victor is soaring because of his recent accomplishment
	and has high aspirations (88–92). But joy
	is transitory, and man’s existence is insubstantial; nevertheless,
	when the gods grant success, life is gentle (93–
	97). The poem concludes with a prayer for Zeus and the
	Aeacidae to preserve Aegina’s freedom (98–100).

	Kindly Peace,

	and daughter of Justice,
	you who hold the supreme keys
	of counsels and wars,
	[c dimgray]5[/c]accept this honor for a Pythian victory from Aristomenes.
	For you know how to bestow gentleness and likewise
	to receive it with unerring appropriateness;

	but, whenever someone fixes implacable
	hatred in his heart,
	[c dimgray]10[/c]you roughly oppose the might
	of enemies and put their insolence
	in the bilge. Porphyrion
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] did not know your power
	when he unduly provoked you. Gain is most precious
	if one takes it from the home of a willing giver.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Pythian 9[/b]
	Probably performed in 474, this is the only ode to a
	victor of the race in armor. Because of the future δέξεται
	(73), many commentators have supposed that the ode was
	performed in Thebes, but the future cannot be taken so literally
	(cf. κωμάσομαι at 89, “I shall \[now\] celebrate”).
	The main narrative, which tells of Apollo’s love for the
	huntress Cyrene, whom he takes from Thessaly to become
	queen of the foremost city in Libya, is structured by ring
	composition. The critical moment of Apollo’s decision is
	dramatized in a dialogue with Chiron.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After cataloguing Telesicrates’ victories, Pindar concludes
	the poem with a second narrative, ostensibly requested
	by the victor, telling how Telesicrates’ ancestor
	won his wife in a foot race arranged by her father Antaeus
	in imitation of Danaus’ marriage of his daughters. This
	account brings together two prominent themes in the ode,
	athletics and marriage.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Upon announcing his intention to praise Telesicrates
	and Cyrene (1–4), the poet moves immediately into a summary
	of the forthcoming narrative: Apollo took Cyrene
	from Pelion in Thessaly to be queen of Libya, where Aphrodite
	joined them in marriage (5–13). She, the daughter
	of Hypseus, king of the Lapithae, disliked the typical activities
	of girls, preferring instead to protect her father’s
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 348[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	herds from wild predators (14–25). When Apollo saw her
	wrestling with a lion, he called Chiron from his cave to inquire
	about the girl’s identity and to ask if he should make
	love to her (26–37).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Chiron answers playfully that first loves must be consummated
	in private and chides Apollo for asking questions
	to which he, the all-knowing god, already knows the
	answers (38–49). Nonetheless, he predicts that Apollo will
	establish Cyrene in Libya, where she will reign and bear a
	son, Aristaeus, who will protect the flocks (50–65). His
	prediction is swiftly fulfilled; on that very day she is installed
	as queen of a city famous for athletics (66–70). She
	will welcome Telesicrates, who was victorious at Pytho
	(71–75).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet has much to say in praise of the victor, but
	chooses to elaborate a few well-chosen themes (76–79). As
	he recalls Telesicrates’ victory in the Theban Iolaea, he
	tells briefly of the Theban heroes Iolaus, Heracles, and
	Iphicles (79–89a). After praying for the Graces’ continued
	inspiration, he extends the catalogue with three victories
	at Aegina and Megara (89a–92) and exhorts Telesicrates’
	townsmen to praise him for his many victories in the local
	games (93–103).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet is asked to tell of the victor’s ancestor Alexidamus,
	who won his bride in a foot race (103–125).

	[b]Pythian 10[/b]
	If the date of 498 given by the scholia is correct, this is
	the earliest epinicion in the collection, and yet it contains
	most of the distinctive features of Pindar’s style. The only
	ode to a Thessalian, it was apparently commissioned by
	Thorax, the leader of the Aleuadae of Larissa, located
	down the Peneius River from Pelinna, the victor’s city. The
	central narrative, framed in ring composition, tells of
	Perseus’ journey to the Hyperboreans, whose blessed life
	serves as a measure of the success enjoyed by the victor
	and his father.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After a grand opening that links Thessaly with Lacedaemon
	through Heracles, the poet abruptly turns to the
	occasion at hand, Hippocleas’ Pythian victory in the boys’
	diaulos (1–9). Although Apollo surely aided him in his victory,
	he also inherited athletic ability from his father, who
	had twice won the race in armor at Olympia and once at
	Pytho (10–16).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet prays that the gods may continue to favor
	them both and declares that a man is blessed who is himself
	a great victor and lives to see his son win Pythian
	crowns (17–26). Such a one has reached the limits of human
	success, beyond which lies the inaccessible land of the
	Hyperboreans (27–30). Perseus once visited them while
	they were delighting Apollo with their sacrifices of asses
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 366[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	(31–36). The Muse resides with them as they enjoy music,
	poetry, and feasting, and they never become sick or grow
	old (37–44). The narrative section concludes with a brief
	mention of Perseus’ famous exploit of slaying the Gorgon
	and turning his mother’s captors into stone (44–48).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After marveling at the power of the gods, the poet suddenly
	suspends his song’s progress and declares that encomia
	must vary their subjects (48–54). He hopes that his
	songs will make the victor more admired among his countrymen,
	especially the young girls (55–59). It is sweet to
	gain what one desires in the present, but the unforeseeable
	future looms ahead (59–63). The poet places his confidence
	in his friend Thorax, who commissioned the ode,
	and praises his brothers, good men who maintain the
	Thessalian state (64–72).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Pythian 11[/b]
	The centerpiece of this poem, sometimes called a “little
	[c dimgray]Oresteia[/c], ”is the story of Clytaemestra’s murder of Agamemnon.
	It is narrated in ring composition and provides a
	striking contrast to the public-spirited success of the victor
	and his family, who strive for achievements in the tradition
	of the Theban hero Iolaus and the Tyndaridae. The
	poet’s elaborate disclaimer in 38–42, in which he asks if
	he has strayed from his course, is meant to call attention
	to the discrepancy between the myth and the career of
	Thrasydaeus and his father. The scholia give conflicting
	dates and events for the victory: 474 in the boys’ stadion
	and 454 in the men’s diaulos (or stadion); the former is
	more likely.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The major heroines of Thebes are summoned to
	Apollo’s Ismenian temple to celebrate Pytho, where
	Thrasydaeus has won a third victory for Thebes (1–16).
	The poet glides quickly into the story of Orestes, who was
	rescued by his nurse Arsinoa from Clytaemestra’s designs
	on his life after she had killed Cassandra and Agamemnon
	(17–22). He ponders whether she was angered because of
	the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, or because of her adulterous
	love affair, a sin that becomes town gossip when it concerns
	the wealthy (22–30). Without giving an answer, he closes
	the ring by briefly relating the deaths of Agamemnon and
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 378[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	Cassandra after Troy’s destruction, the escape of Orestes
	to Strophius, and his eventual return to slay his mother and
	Aegisthus (31–37).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet asks if he has taken a wrong turn or gotten
	off course (38–40) and reminds his Muse that she is under
	contract to praise Pythonicus and his son Thrasydaeus,
	both of whom won the foot race at Pytho (41–50). He
	states his preference for god-given success and for a moderate
	position in a city (as opposed to the tyrant’s station),
	and praises accomplishments that promote the common
	good because they keep envy at bay (50–54). The best possession
	to bequeath at death is a good name, which is what
	Iolaus, Castor, and Polydeuces (all three athletes and patrons
	of games) enjoy in song (55–64).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Pythian 12[/b]
	From the time of its founding, the Pythian festival included
	musical contests. In 490 Midas of Acragas won
	the competition for the [c dimgray]aulos[/c], which I have translated by
	“pipe, ”but was in fact more like a modern clarinet or oboe
	and consisted of a bronze mouthpiece and reed body. Traditionally
	the invention of Athena, it was known for its
	expressive range (cf. πάμφωνον at 19 and [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 7.12) and
	especially for the “many headed tune, ”whose invention
	Pindar also attributes to Athena.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The story of Danaë, merely sketched by Pindar in ring
	composition, is as follows. King Acrisius of Argos, fearing
	that the child born to his daughter Danaë would supplant
	him, locked her up in a tower. Zeus came to her in a shower
	of gold and sired Perseus. When the king learned of it, he
	shut the mother and her baby in a chest and put them out
	to sea. They came ashore on the island of Seriphus, where
	King Polydectes kept them for many years, making Danaë
	his mistress. When he invited the leaders of Seriphus to
	come to a feast and bring him gifts, the young Perseus
	went off to acquire the head of the Gorgon Medusa as his
	present. By stealing the one eye belonging to the Graeae,
	Phorcus’ daughters, he forced them to reveal the location
	of their three sisters, the Gorgons. With the help of
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 388[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	Athena, Perseus cut off Medusa’s head, brought it to the
	banquet, and turned his enemies to stone.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poem opens with an invocation of Acragas (as
	nymph and city) to accept this celebration of Midas for his
	victorious pipe playing at Pytho (1–6). Athena invented
	the art of pipe playing when she reproduced in music the
	Gorgons’ dirge for their sister, Medusa, after Perseus carried
	off her head, with which he turned the people of
	Seriphus to stone (6–12). He blinded the Graeae and punished
	Polydectes for his enslavement of Danaë (13–18),
	after which Athena composed the “many-headed tune ”in
	imitation of Euryale’s lament for her sister, and gave it to
	mortals (18–23). It still serves to summon people to the
	games and to lead dances (24–27).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ode closes with a series of gnomes stressing the
	hard work necessary for success and the unpredictability
	of divine gifts (28–32).

	Pindar composed two odes for Chromius ([c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 1 and
	9), Hieron’s powerful and wealthy general. In his previous
	service as a military commander for Hippocrates, tyrant of
	Gela (498–491), Chromius had distinguished himself in
	the battle at the Helorus River in 492 (cf. [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 9.40)
	against the Syracusans. He then joined Hippocrates’ successor,
	Gelon, who became tyrant of Syracuse, and upon
	Gelon’s death in 478, he served Hieron, who had succeeded
	his older brother. Chromius was probably sent to
	protect Western Locri from Anaxilas of Rhegium in 477
	and according to the scholia was appointed governor of
	Aetna after its foundation in 476. The inscriptions of two
	mss designate the victor as Chromius “of Aetna” (cf. “Zeus
	of Aetna” at 6). If they are correct, the ode was composed
	after 476.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This is one of two epinicia—the other is [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 10—
	whose central narrative extends to the end of the poem.
	The account of Heracles’ prodigious infancy is probably
	meant to reflect Chromius’ own divinely inspired beginnings
	(8–9), while the concluding depiction of the apotheosis
	Heracles earned by his arduous service to the gods
	perhaps hints at the posthumous fame Chromius may win
	by his own career.

	victory (1–7). After reflections on the divine basis of
	Chromius’ talents and the glorification of success in poetry,
	Pindar praises Sicily for its fertility, fine cities, and
	success in war and athletics (8–18).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He then praises Chromius for his generous hospitality,
	which wins him friends to defend against detractors, and
	for his combination of strength and wisdom (19–30). The
	poet personally endorses the use of wealth to help friends
	and gain praise because all men hope for relief from hardship
	and fame for achievements (31–33). The poet declares
	his eagerness to sing of Heracles when he is treating
	great achievements, and begins by recounting how, when
	Heracles and his twin brother Iphicles were born, Hera
	sent two snakes to kill them in their crib (33–43), but
	Heracles grasped one in each hand and strangled them
	(43–47). Alcmene jumped up from her bed in panic to protect
	her son, while Amphitryon came with a band of warriors
	(48–53). His fearful expectations, however, turned to
	relief and awe when he saw the wondrous power of his son
	(54–59).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Teiresias, summoned to interpret the events, prophesied
	Heracles’ future career (60–61), telling that after slaying
	numerous beasts on land and sea, and vanquishing
	savage men, he would help the gods defeat the Giants at
	Phlegra, and that in reward for his labors he would find
	peace with the gods on Olympus, with Hebe as his wife
	(62–72).

	Timodemus, the namesake of his clan, the Timodemidae
	from Acharnae (an Athenian deme), has increased
	their impressive list of successes by his Nemean victory in
	the pancratium. The poet surmises that this is but the prelude
	(or down payment) to future victories in the crown
	games, and suggests, by the analogy of Orion following
	close behind the Pleiades, that an Olympic victory, conspicuously
	absent from the family’s list, may come in due
	course. This optimism is bolstered by the example of Aja
	Xfrom nearby Salamis (where the scholia claim Timodemus
	was raised) and by the proven success of the Timodemidae
	in athletics.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Because the poem is monostrophic and at the end calls
	on the citizens to lead off in song, some have suggested
	that it was a processional song intended for [c dimgray]da capo[/c] repetition.
	There is, however, no external evidence for such a
	practice.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Just as rhapsodes begin their performances with a prelude
	to Zeus, Timodemus has made a beginning with his
	victory at Zeus’ Nemean games (1–5), and if he continues
	in the tradition of his fathers, he is likely to win many
	more times at the Isthmus, Delphi, and (it is implied) at
	Olympia (6–12). Salamis raised a great fighter in Ajax, and
	Timodemus is exalted by his victory in the pancratium

	(13–15). Among the brave Acharnians the Timodemidae
	are the foremost in athletics (16–18). They have won four
	Pythian crowns, eight Isthmian, seven Nemean, and many
	local ones (19–24). The citizens are called upon to sing
	praises of Zeus as Timodemus returns in glory (24–25).

	<h2>2. For Timodemus of
	Acharnae</h2>
	[b]Winner, Pancratium[/b]
	Just as the sons of Homer, those singers
	of verses stitched together,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] most often begin
	with a prelude to Zeus, so has this man
	received his first installment of victory
	in the sacred games at the much-hymned
	[c dimgray]5[/c]sanctuary of Nemean Zeus.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But Timonoös’ son is still indebted—if indeed his life,
	while guiding him straight on the path of his fathers,
	has given him as an adornment for great Athens—
	to pluck again and again the fairest prize
	of the Isthmian festivals and to be victorious
	[c dimgray]10[/c]in the Pythian games; and it is likely
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Composers and reciters of Homeric poems were called “sons
	of Homer” or “rhapsodes” (literally “singers of stitched-together
	verses”). Their independent compositions, like the Homeric
	Hymns, were commonly called “preludes.”

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Nemean 3[/b]
	At the beginning of the poem the chorus of young men
	is eagerly waiting on Aegina to receive the song from the
	Muse, and at the end we are told that the ode was late in
	coming. The poet, however, provides no explanation for
	the delay. The central portion of the ode sketches the principal
	exploits of three Aeginetan heroes, Peleus, Telamon,
	and Achilles. In particular, Achilles’ youthful prowess exemplifies
	the inborn greatness of the Aeacidae.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet summons the Muse to Aegina, where the chorus
	is awaiting her voice (1–5). A summary priamel emphasizes
	victory’s love of song (6–8). The Muse is requested to
	begin a hymn to Zeus for the poet to impart to the singers
	and the lyre (9–12). He is pleased to praise this island,
	home of the Myrmidons, and Aristocleides, who has won
	the pancratium at Nemea (12–18).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The assertion that Aristocleides has reached the limit
	of human success, symbolized by the Pillars of Heracles,
	prompts a brief digression on Heracles’ exploration of the
	western Mediterranean (19–26). Implying that his enthusiasm
	has carried him away, the poet redirects his praise to
	the Aeacidae, a more relevant theme (26–32).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Peleus single-handedly subdued the city of Iolcus and
	captured Thetis for his wife (32–36); Telamon and Iolaus
	sacked Laomedon’s Troy and fought against the Amazons
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 22[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Nemean 2[/b][/c]
	(36–39). A gnomic statement praising inborn ability and
	declaring that mere learning lacks clear purpose and
	proves ineffective (40–42) leads to extended praise of
	Achilles, whose prodigious hunting prowess at age si
	Xamazed even Artemis and Athena (43–52). A brief priamel
	listing Chiron’s pupils culminates in his preparation of
	Achilles for the expedition against Troy, where he fought
	against Memnon (52–63).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After addressing Zeus as progenitor of the Aeacidae
	and patron of Nemea, the poet praises Aristocleides for
	the glory he brings to Aegina and for the hopeful expectations
	he inspires in the official delegation to Delphi (64–
	70). But it is through trial that merit is revealed at each
	stage of a man’s life (70–74).We mortals are guided by four
	virtues and must live in the present (74–75). The poet
	states that the victor possesses these virtues and, in imitation
	of hymnal style, bids him farewell (76).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He sends the victor this draught of song and admits that
	it is late (76–80). By implicitly comparing himself to an
	eagle swooping on its prey, Pindar implies that he has
	nobly fulfilled his duty to praise Aristocleides (80–82) and
	assures him that his victories at Nemea, Epidaurus, and
	Megara have achieved recognition in poetry (83–84).

	<h2>3. For Aristocleides of
	Aegina</h2>
	[b]Winner, Pancratium[/b]
	O mistress Muse, our mother, I beg of you,
	come in the Nemean sacred month to this
	much-visited Dorian island of Aegina, for by the water
	of Asopus[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] are waiting the builders of honey-sounding
	[c dimgray]5[/c]revels, young men who seek your voice.
	Different deeds thirst for different rewards,
	but victory in the games loves song most of all,
	the fittest companion for crowned achievements.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Grant from my skill an abundance of such song,
	[c dimgray]10[/c]but begin for the ruler of the cloud-covered sky,
	daughter,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	a proper hymn, and I shall impart it to their voices
	and the lyre. It will be a joyous task to glorify
	this land, where the Myrmidons of old
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The main river Asopus runs through Boeotia, south of
	Thebes; an Asopus also ran near Sicyon. Following a citation of Callistratus (2nd cent. b.c.) in the scholia, G. A. Privitera, in
	[c dimgray]Quaderni Urbinati di Cultura Classica[/c] 29 (1988) 63–70, has
	shown the likelihood of a fountain called Asopus on Aegina connected
	with local athletic contests in honor of Apollo Delphinius.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The Muses were daughters of Zeus by Mnemosyne (cf. Hes.
	[c dimgray]Th[/c]. 53–55).

	[b]Nemean 4[/b]
	This poem in celebration of Timasarchus, a victorious
	boy wrestler, reflects upon the interrelationship of song,
	struggle, suffering, and death. The ode opens with an image
	of limbs tired from the contest for which song provides
	the most soothing remedy; we soon learn that the boy’s father,
	a musician, is dead; the brief account of Heracles’
	fight with the giant Alcyoneus stresses the suffering that
	victory entails; and we are told that the boy’s uncle, also a
	victorious athlete, has died. Although poetry provides consolation
	for suffering and death, it too requires struggle,
	and in a digression (33–43) on how best to execute his
	poem, the poet portrays himself in contention with rival
	poets. He concludes by comparing himself to a wrestler as
	he praises the trainer Melesias.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Songs of praise are more relaxing even than warm water
	after hard toil, for well-executed poetry survives after
	deeds are completed (1–8). The poet hopes that he can
	fittingly praise Timasarchus and find favor with Aegina,
	hospitable to foreigners (9–13). If Timocritus were still
	alive, he would be performing this song in celebration of
	his son’s victories at Nemea, Athens, and Thebes (13–24).
	Mention of Thebes prompts a digression on the achievements
	of Telamon and Heracles, culminating in their battle
	against Alcyoneus (25–32).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 34[/c]

	[b]Pindar[/b]
	The poet announces that he will resist the constraints
	of the genre, the pressure of time, and his own desire to
	celebrate the new-moon festival, and by not curtailing his
	narrative will prove victorious over rival poets who would
	begrudge full praise to those who deserve it (33–41). He
	then confidently strikes up a song for Aegina’s heroes (41–
	46). A geographical survey of lands ruled by the Aeacidae
	culminates in the exploits of Peleus, including his capture
	of Iolcus after overcoming the treachery of Acastus and
	Hippolyta, his struggle to win Thetis, and their wedding
	attended by the gods (46–68).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet turns his ship of song from the inexhaustible
	glory of the Aeacidae to Timasarchus’ clan, the Theandridae,
	who have commissioned him to announce their
	athletic victories in song (69–79). He politely declines,
	however, to sing the full praises of Timasarchus’ dead
	uncle, a former victor at the Isthmus, on the grounds that
	Timasarchus’ grandfather, who possesses firsthand knowledge,
	is better qualified to eulogize him (79–92). But were
	he to praise the trainer Melesias, Pindar imagines how
	formidable a competitor he would be (93–96).

	<h2>4. For Timasarchus
	of Aegina</h2>
	[b]Winner, Boys’ Wrestling[/b]
	The best healer for toils judged successful
	is joyous revelry, but songs too, those wise
	daughters of the Muses, soothe them[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] with their touch.
	Not even warm water relaxes the limbs as much
	[c dimgray]5[/c]as praise, the companion of the lyre.
	For the word lives longer than deeds,
	which, with the Graces’ blessing,
	the tongue draws from the depths of the mind.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	May I set forth such a word for Cronus’ son Zeus and
	Nemea,
	[c dimgray]10[/c]and for Timasarchus’ wrestling,
	as my hymn’s prelude; and may it find welcome in the
	Aeacidae’s high-towered domain, that beacon of justice
	protecting all foreigners. And if your father Timocritus
	were still warmed by the blazing sun, often would he
	have
	[c dimgray]15[/c]played an elaborate tune on the lyre, and, relying on
	this song, would have celebrated his triumphant son
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]

	[c darkmagenta][b]PINDAR, Nemean Odes[/b][/c]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Nemean 5[/b]
	This is one of four extant epinicia by Pindar and Bacchylides
	praising the two sons of Lampon, members of
	an Aeginetan family expert in the pancratium. Pindar and
	Bacchylides (13) both composed odes in celebration of this
	Nemean victory won by Pytheas, probably in 485 or 483.
	Pindar subsequently composed [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 6 for Pytheas’ younger
	brother Phylacidas, a boy victor at the Isthmus, and
	[c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 5, also for Phylacidas after he had won a Nemean
	and second Isthmian victory. The boys’ maternal uncle
	Euthymenes and grandfather Themistius were also victors.
	All four odes are composed of dactylo-epitritic triads
	and feature episodes from the sagas of the Aeacidae.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Contrasting his ode with statues that rest on their bases,
	Pindar bids his song travel forth on all boats, large and
	small, from the island of Aegina to announce the Nemean
	victory of young Pytheas, who brings glory to the Aeacidae
	and to Aegina, hospitable to foreigners (1–8). The poet
	abruptly adds that Peleus, Telamon, and their half-brother
	Phocus prayed to Zeus Hellanius that Aegina would be a
	land of brave sailors (9–13), but refrains from stating what
	subsequently caused the two brothers to be driven from
	Aegina, on the grounds that not everything true needs to
	be said (14–18).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Eager to praise success, he turns instead to the
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 46[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	wedding of Peleus and Thetis on Pelion, at which the Muses
	sang of how Hippolyta, the wife of Acastus, attempted to
	seduce Peleus, her guest. When he rejected her advances,
	she falsely told her husband that he had attempted to rape
	her (19–34). In appreciation of his virtue, Zeus rewarded
	him with the sea nymph Thetis for a bride (34–39).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A gnomic reflection on the importance of inherited
	ability introduces Pytheas’ uncle, twice victorious—perhaps
	at the Isthmus—and at Nemea, Aegina, and Megara
	(40–46). After expressing his pleasure at the whole city’s
	enthusiasm for athletics, the poet reminds Pytheas that he
	owes his victory to his trainer Menander from Athens (46–
	49). He concludes with praise of Themistius, the victor’s
	grandfather, who had won a double victory at Epidaurus in
	boxing and the pancratium (50–54).

	[b]Nemean 6[/b]
	The victory of Alcimidas in boys’ wrestling marks the
	twenty-fifth won in the crown games by his clan the Bassidae.
	A remarkable feature of the victor’s own family, which
	Pindar declares holds more boxing crowns than any other
	in Greece, is its athletic success in alternate generations.
	Alcimidas’ father is not even named, but his grandfather,
	Praxidamas, was extremely successful, with three victories
	at Nemea, five at the Isthmus, and one at Olympia. His
	great-grandfather, Socleides, was not distinguished, but
	his great-great-grandfather, Hagesimachus, apparently
	was. Two other family members, Callias and Creontidas
	(whose relationship to the victor is not clear), were also
	successful athletes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Although we share the same mother (Earth) with the
	gods and resemble them in mind and body, our mortality
	and inability to foresee the future make us as nothing in
	comparison to them (1–7). Alcimidas’ inherited destiny
	has been like the fields, alternately productive and fallow,
	for having won the boys’ wrestling at Nemea he emulates
	his successful grandfather, Praxidamas (8–20), whose own
	father, Socleides, derived his fame from his three successful
	sons (20–24).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet declares that no other house has won more
	boxing crowns than theirs, and expresses the hope that his
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 58[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	bold claim is accurate (24–28). He summons the Muse
	to sing of the Bassidae, whose achievements provide the
	Muses’ plowmen with much work (28–34). He adds that
	other members of the family, Callias and Creontidas, had
	been victorious at Delphi and Nemea (34–44).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Eulogists have many ways to praise Aegina, because the
	achievements of the Aeacidae are known far and wide (45–
	49), even to the Ethiopians, whose leader Memnon was
	killed by Achilles at Troy (49–53). Former poets had much
	to say about the exploits of the Aeacidae, and the poet, too,
	has followed their lead, but he now turns to the occasion of
	his ode (53–57). His task is to announce that Alcimidas has
	won his family’s twenty-fifth crown victory (57–61). He
	mentions in passing that two Olympic victories were denied
	Alcimidas and Polytimidas because of an unlucky
	draw (61–63). The poem concludes with brief praise of the
	trainer Melesias (64–66).

	[b]6. For Alcimidas of Aegina[/b]
	[b]Winner, Boys’ Wrestling[/b]
	There is one race of men, another of gods; but from one
	mother[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	we both draw our breath. Yet the allotment of a wholly
	different power separates us, for the one race is nothing,
	whereas the bronze heaven remains a secure abode
	forever. Nevertheless, we do somewhat resemble
	[c dimgray]5[/c]the immortals, either in greatness of mind or bodily
	nature,
	although we do not know
	by day or in the night
	to what goal destiny
	has marked for us to run.

	And now Alcimidas makes it clear to see that his

	nature is like crop-bearing fields, which alternate

	[b]Nemean 7[/b]
	This ode, which Gildersleeve called “the touchstone of
	Pindaric interpretation,” is one of the most difficult to understand.
	There are a number of textual problems, most
	importantly at 33–34; in several places the tone becomes
	very defensive without any indication of what is at issue
	(e.g., 64–69, 75–76, and 102–105); one topic often follows
	another without a clear transition; and finally the meaning
	or point of several passages is doubtful (e.g., 17–20, 31, 70–
	73, 77–79, and 102–105). Many scholars follow remarks in
	the scholia asserting that Pindar is apologizing for his supposedly
	unflattering treatment of Neoptolemus in [c dimgray]Pae[/c]. 6,
	but neither poem can be dated and such speculation has
	proved of little assistance in interpreting [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 7. What is
	remarkable is that such a long, complex, and often beautiful
	poem should have been written for a boy athlete.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A hymn to Eleithyia, goddess of childbirth, leads to an
	announcement of Sogenes’ victory in the pentathlon (1–8).
	His city Aegina, home of the Aeacidae, fosters athletics
	and song (9–10). Poetry serves as a mirror to reflect and
	hold the memory of successful deeds (11–16). Wise men,
	recognizing that death is inevitable, do not hoard their
	wealth (17–20).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pindar claims that Homer has exaggerated Odysseus’
	real experiences through his deceptive poetic craft (20–
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 70[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	23), and that if the majority of men had not been blind to
	the fact that Ajax was the best fighter after Achilles, Aja
	Xwould not have killed himself in anger over the decision of
	the arms (23–30). Although all men must die, some are
	honored in posthumous song by a god’s grace (30–32).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet brings his helping song to Delphi, where
	Neoptolemus is buried (33–36). After reigning briefly in
	Molossia, Neoptolemus brought spoils from Troy to Delphi,
	where he was killed in a quarrel (36–42), but he
	fulfilled his fate and now presides over festival processions
	(43–47). No lengthy proof is required: Apollo is the witness
	for Neoptolemus’ greatness (48–49). The poet could
	say much more about Aegina and her heroes, but declines
	to do so (50–53).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Gnomic reflections echoing those in the opening hymn
	conclude with the observation that no one enjoys perfect
	happiness (53–58). The poet praises his host Thearion for
	wise use of his good fortune (58–63), and calls a descendant
	of Neoptolemus to witness that his praise is just (64–
	69). Turning to Sogenes, he compares his own poetic
	efforts to those required in the pentathlon, and strikes up
	a new prelude, celebrating Zeus, Nemea, Aegina, and
	Aeacus and ending with Heracles (70–86), upon whom
	Sogenes can rely as a neighbor because his home is located
	between two of Heracles’ sanctuaries (86–94). The poet
	prays that Heracles may grant the victor, his father, and
	their descendants a happy life (94–101), and concludes by
	declaring that he has praised Neoptolemus with fitting
	words and that there is no need to repeat what is obvious
	(102–105).

	[b]Nemean 8[/b]
	Since the ode lacks a title in the mss, the event must be
	conjectured from the ambiguous notices in lines 16 and
	47–48. Some editors argue that the victories were in the
	stadion, but most follow Didymus and the scholia in assigning
	them to the diaulos, the double stadion. The victor’s
	deceased father Megas had won the same event at
	Nemea. The main narrative, introduced as an illustration
	of the power of envy to obscure true greatness, tells of
	Odysseus’ use of deceptive speech to win the arms of
	Achilles, an episode also treated in [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 7 and [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 4.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The opening hymn to Hora, the goddess of adolescence,
	emphasizes that her treatment of the young can be
	mild or harsh (1–3). A gnomic statement recommending
	noble love is illustrated by that of Zeus and Aegina, which
	produced Aeacus, renowned for his just rule (4–12). The
	poet comes as a suppliant of Aeacus bringing this tribute
	for the racing victories of Deinias and his father Megas
	(13–16).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A gnomic reflection on the longevity of god-given prosperity
	is briefly illustrated by the example of Cinyras (17–
	18). As if standing at the starting line of a race, the poet
	draws breath before continuing because, he avows, new
	words of praise are exposed to envy, which delights in assailing
	good men, as when it caused Ajax’s suicide (19–23).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 86[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	Because that hero was unable to speak for himself, the
	prize of the armor was awarded in a secret vote to Odysseus
	(24–27). In fact, however, Ajax had proven himself a
	much more effective fighter, but malicious misrepresentation
	existed even then to abase good men and raise up
	unworthy ones (28–34).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet prays that he may never be guilty of misrepresenting
	true worth, but instead be forthright and leave
	behind a good name for his children (35–37). In a brief
	priamel he states his desire to bestow praise and blame
	where it is due (37–39). The wise and just poet nurtures excellence
	(40–42). Although friends are most needed during
	times of trial, they are also sought out in times of joy
	(42–44). The poet cannot bring Megas back to life, but he
	can, in song, honor his homeland, his clan, and his victories,
	and thereby provide consolation for pain (44–50).
	The hymn of celebration predates the war of the Seven
	against Thebes (50–51).

	[b]Nemean 9[/b]
	The last three odes in the Nemean collection do not
	celebrate victories in the Nemean games. This poem, like
	[c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 1, is dedicated to Chromius, Hieron’s eminent commander,
	but was placed here at the end of the roll because
	it celebrates a victory in the Sicyonian games. Since Aetna,
	its place of performance, is called “newly founded” (2), the
	victory was probably won in 474 or soon thereafter. In contrast
	to [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 1, which praises Chromius in general terms
	(and by implicit comparison with Heracles), this poem
	concentrates on his martial successes. It is not certain which
	ode was composed first.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The games celebrated at Sicyon in Pindar’s time had
	been instituted by Cleisthenes in honor of Pythian Apollo
	(Hdt. 5.67), but the poet attributes their founding to
	Adrastus during his exile there from Argos before his first
	expedition against Thebes. By placing a prayer that battle
	with the Carthaginians may be long postponed immediately
	after a narration of the disastrous expedition of the
	Seven against Thebes, Pindar seems to imply that an invasion
	by them would entail the same consequences.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poem opens with a summons to the Muses to
	proceed from Sicyon to Aetna and to Chromius’ home
	swamped with guests, where Chromius in his chariot calls
	for a song to honor Leto and her twins (1–5). A gnomic
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 96[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	statement on the need to praise achievement prompts the
	poet to celebrate the equestrian contests instituted by
	Adrastus at Sicyon, where he reigned after his expulsion
	from Argos by Amphiaraus (6–14). Adrastus ended their
	quarrel by marrying his sister Eriphyle to Amphiaraus
	(15–17). Subsequently, Adrastus disregarded Zeus’ unfavorable
	omens and led an expedition against Thebes that
	resulted in disaster for the army and death for Amphiaraus
	(18–27).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet prays that Zeus may avert any such confrontation
	with the Carthaginians as long as possible, provide
	good governance for generations within Aetna, and foster
	festivals (28–32). He praises the Aetnaeans for their horsemanship
	and uncorrupted sense of honor, and Chromius
	for his courage in many battles on land and sea, beginning
	with his early victory at the Helorus River (32–43). The
	poet assures Chromius that the gods have granted him a
	happy life; when one is prosperous and famous, he has
	reached the limit of success (44–47).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet calls for wine to be served in the silver bowls
	that Chromius and his horses won at Sicyon, and concludes
	by praying that he may surpass other eulogists in praising
	such achievement (48–55).

	Let us go in revelry from Apollo at Sicyon, Muses,

PINDAR, Nemean Odes
	[c darkmagenta][b]PINDAR, Nemean Odes[/b][/c]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Nemean 10[/b]
	Although Theaeus had previously been victorious in
	wrestling at Nemea, this poem was placed with the other
	two anomalous odes at the end of the Nemean roll because
	it celebrates his victory in the Argive Heraea (or
	Hecatombaea). The first triad contains an impressive catalog
	of Argive heroes that culminates in Heracles, Hebe,
	and Hera on Olympus. Mirroring his city’s abundance of
	distinctions, Theaeus has won at all the major games, but
	lacks an Olympic victory to become a [c dimgray]periodonikēs[/c]. The
	poet tactfully portrays this veteran wrestler as too modest
	to voice his hope for an Olympic crown.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This is the only epinicion besides [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 1 in which the
	main narrative continues to the very end of the poem. It is
	one of the most impressive narratives in the corpus; its
	long dactylo-epitritic periods, alternating speeches, martial
	subject, and concentration on one moment of choice
	give it a decidedly Iliadic character.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Graces are summoned to sing of Hera’s Argos, a
	city with countless claims to fame (1–3). A catalog of Argive
	heroes (Perseus, Epaphus, Hypermestra, Diomedes,
	Amphiaraus, Alcmene, Danaë, Talaus, Lynceus, Amphitryon,
	and Heracles) is rounded off with an allusion to Hera
	(4–18).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet curtails his praise of Argos’ past achievements
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 108[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	by expressing his inability to recount (and his listeners to
	endure) all its glories (19–20). Turning his attention to
	wrestling, he lists Theaeus’ achievements, beginning with
	his two victories in the local games dedicated to Hera (21–
	24), followed by his Panhellenic crowns: one at Pytho and
	three each at the Isthmus and Nemea (25–28). The poet
	prays to Zeus for an Olympic victory to follow and cites
	as harbingers two previous successes in the Athenian Panathenaea
	(29–36).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Theaeus’ maternal relatives are praised for their victories
	in horse racing at the Isthmus and Nemea, and
	numerous victories are mentioned at other games in the
	Peloponnesus (37–48). The poet attributes the family’s
	athletic success to the favor of the Tyndaridae, who were
	hosted by an ancestor named Pamphaës and have faithfully
	watched over the family ever since (49–54).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A brief summary of the forthcoming narrative tells that
	after Castor was killed Polydeuces chose to share his lot by
	spending every other day in the underworld (55–59). The
	ensuing account describes how Idas and Lynceus quarreled
	with the Tyndaridae and fatally wounded Castor. After
	Polydeuces and Zeus killed the two sons of Aphareus,
	Polydeuces returned to his dying brother and prayed to
	Zeus that he might die as well (60–79). Zeus granted him
	the choice of remaining immortal himself or sharing with
	his brother a daily alternation between the underworld
	and Olympus (80–88). Without hesitation Polydeuces
	chose to revive his brother Castor (89–90).

	[b]Nemean 11[/b]
	The occasion for this poem is the installation of
	Aristagoras for a year on the governing council of Tenedos.
	The early editors presumably placed this ode among the
	epinicia rather than the encomia because of its emphasis
	on Aristagoras’ youthful athletic prowess. Added to the
	praise of Tenedos and Aristagoras are frequent allusions to
	the limitations of human life, lost opportunities for success,
	alternation of achievement and failure, the uncertainty
	of the future, and the suffering caused by excessive
	ambition—worthwhile considerations for a future councillor.
	Hestia, goddess of the hearth and of town halls, is
	invoked and requested to welcome Aristagoras into her
	service (1–3). The council is praised for its rule on Tenedos
	and its celebration of Zeus, god of hospitality (4–9). After
	praying that Aristagoras may successfully complete his
	year’s service, the poet praises him for his strength and
	courage (10–12). Reflections on human achievement, mortality,
	and the need to celebrate success lead to the announcement
	that Aristagoras and his family have won
	sixteen victories at local games in wrestling and the pancratium
	(13–21).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet avers that if Aristagoras’ overly cautious parents
	had not held him back, he would have been victorious
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 124[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	in wrestling at Pytho and Olympia (22–29). This prompts
	the observation that too great or too little confidence can
	thwart success (29–32). Aristagoras bears the mark of his
	illustrious ancestry deriving from Sparta and Thebes, but
	not every generation produces the fruit of achievement
	(33–43). Men cannot know the future, and we often hope
	for too much success; moderation is best, for wanting what
	is impossible results in pain (43–48).

	Ceans to perform in honor of Delian Apollo because, it
	appears, Theban athletes have won six crowns in the
	Isthmian games and his allegiance to his mother city requires
	him to celebrate her first. Pindar never mentions
	the names of the other athletes (although his praise of
	Castor and Iolaus suggests a variety of events), but concentrates
	instead on the victory of Herodotus, who drove his
	own chariot, a noteworthy achievement, since most noblemen
	hired their charioteers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet assures Thebe, the eponymous nymph of
	Thebes, that her interests are his foremost concern (1–3).
	He asks Delos not to resent his postponement of the paean
	in her honor, for he intends to complete both her poem
	and this one celebrating the Isthmus, occasioned by the si
	Xcrowns that Thebans have won there (3–13).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet proposes to link Herodotus with the charioteers
	Castor and Iolaus, who are hymned for their various
	athletic victories (14–31). After bidding farewell to
	these heroes, the poet alludes to some misfortune that
	Asopodorus, the victor’s father, had previously suffered,
	but contrasts it with his present good fortune and com-
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 134[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	ments on the foresight gained through bitter experience
	(32–40).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The lines that follow express the obligation of poets to
	praise those who strive hard and at great cost to achieve
	success (41–46). A priamel listing various occupations and
	their rewards culminates in the praise earned by athletes
	and soldiers (47–51).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet thanks Poseidon for his help in winning the
	chariot victory and alludes to other contests won by
	Herodotus (52–59), but claims that time does not permit
	mention of all his victories (60–63). The poet hopes that
	Herodotus will be inspired by this praise to honor Thebes
	with future victories at Pytho and Olympia (64–67). The
	poem concludes with a gnomic portrayal of the victor’s
	opposite, a miser who hoards his wealth and gains no posthumous
	fame (67–68).

	[b]Isthmian 2[/b]
	[c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 2 is the last of Pindar’s four epinicia honoring
	the Emmenidae of Acragas. [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 6 commemorates Xenocrates’
	Pythian chariot victory, probably won in 490. [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 2
	and 3 celebrate his brother Theron’s Olympic chariot victory
	in 476. When [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 2 was composed, perhaps as late as
	470, Xenocrates was no longer alive, for Pindar speaks
	of him in the past tense (36–37). The ode was probably
	placed in this book because an Isthmian victory is cited
	first among his past successes. As in the case of [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 6,
	Pindar addresses the ode to Xenocrates’ son Thrasybulus,
	for whom he also wrote an encomium (see [c dimgray]fr[/c]. 124).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poets of old wrote spontaneous love poetry whenever
	a beautiful boy took their fancy, but now the Muse
	sells her poetry and endorses the saying “money makes
	the man” (1–11). The poet acknowledges Thrasybulus’
	awareness of this situation and recounts Xenocrates’ Isthmian
	victory (12–17). After briefly mentioning Xenocrates’
	Pythian victory, the poet recalls the success in the Panathenaea
	achieved by his charioteer, Nicomachus (18–22),
	who also won at Olympia for Xenocrates’ brother Theron
	(23–29).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The homes of the Emmenidae are well acquainted with
	victory celebrations, and the poet finds it easy to bring
	praise to them (30–34). He hopes in particular to succeed
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 146[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	in conveying the kindness of Xenocrates (whose name
	means “host strength”), who was respectful of his fellow
	citizens, a breeder of horses, a devoted worshiper of the
	gods, and a never failing host (35–42).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In the face of men’s inclination to envy, the poet exhorts
	Thrasybulus to keep alive his father’s excellence and to
	make known this poem, which he is sending via Nicasippus
	(43–48).

	[b]Isthmian 3[/b]
	This and the following ode for Melissus of Thebes are
	often treated as one poem by editors because they are metrically
	identical. They are separated, however, in one of the
	two important mss (B) and the scholia treat them as two
	poems. In addition, they celebrate two different occasions:
	[c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 3 makes a passing reference to an Isthmian victory,
	but emphasizes a Nemean chariot victory; [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 4 celebrates
	a victory in the pancratium at the Isthmus, with no
	mention of a chariot victory. A plausible assumption is that
	after [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 4 was composed, Melissus won the chariot race
	at Nemea, and instead of writing its companion poem in a
	different meter, as is the case with other pairs of odes (e.g.,
	[c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 4 and 5, [c dimgray]Ol[/c]. 10 and 11, and [c dimgray]Pyth[/c]. 4 and 5), Pindar composed
	a triad in the identical meter, which adumbrates
	several themes treated more extensively in [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 4.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ode opens with generalized observations on the
	need to praise any citizen who is successful or prosperous
	and is not excessive in his behavior (1–3). Zeus is responsible
	for great achievements, and a proper reverence makes
	prosperity more enduring (4–6). A poet is obligated to
	praise a successful man (7–8).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Melissus is celebrating two victories, one at the
	Isthmus, the other at Nemea in the chariot race (9–13). He
	has inherited his ability from famous ancestors on both
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 156[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	sides of his family, the Cleonymidae and the Labdacidae,
	who were devoted to chariot racing (13–17b). The poem
	closes with a gnomic statement contrasting the vicissitudes
	of an individual’s lifetime with the abiding favor enjoyed
	by sons of gods (18–18b).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Isthmian 4[/b]
	This poem continues to treat themes touched upon in
	[c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 3. Of particular note are the successes and misfortunes
	of the victor’s clan, which was famous for its prowess
	in the past, but recently had lost four men in war (perhaps
	in the battle of Plataea in 479). The victory of Melissus in
	the pancratium at the Isthmus has awakened memory of
	his clan’s earlier victories, but has also called to mind their
	failure to win Panhellenic crowns. Pindar rarely provides
	details about an athlete’s appearance, but here he stresses
	the fact that Melissus was a pancratiast of small stature
	who used his courage and skill to overcome bigger opponents.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Melissus’ Isthmian victory and the achievements of
	his clan, the Cleonymidae, furnish many avenues for praise
	(1–5). Although individuals are subject to vicissitudes, the
	Cleonymidae have always been famous for their hospitality,
	lack of arrogance, and unsurpassed achievements, particularly
	in horse breeding and warfare (5–15). Four of
	them, however, were killed in battle on a single day (16–
	17b). Now the spring has come again with the celebration
	of a victory at the Isthmus, which has reawakened the
	clan’s former fame in chariot racing at Athens and Sicyon
	(18–27). They also competed in the crown games, but
	were unsuccessful (28–33). The gnomic observation that a
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 162[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	weaker man can overcome a stronger one by skill leads to
	the example of Ajax, whose valor went unrewarded by the
	Greeks at Troy (34–36b). Homer, however, immortalized
	his excellence in verse (37–42).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet hopes to accomplish for Melissus what
	Homer did for Ajax (43–45), and praises him for his courage
	and skill, especially the latter, because he was small
	(45–51). His slight stature calls forth the example of the
	Theban hero Heracles, who skillfully defeated the much
	stronger Antaeus (52–55).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After briefly sketching the career of Heracles and his
	apotheosis on Olympus (55–60), the poet describes the
	evening sacrifices performed at Thebes honoring him and
	his sons (61–66), and mentions the following day’s athletic
	games, at which Melissus was twice victorious as an adult
	and once as a boy (67–71b). The poem concludes with
	brief praise of his trainer Orseas (71b–72b).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Isthmian 5[/b]
	This is the last of the three poems Pindar composed
	for the sons of Lampon. Phylacidas, younger brother of
	Pytheas (celebrated in [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 5), had won an Isthmian victory
	as a boy (celebrated in [c dimgray]Isth[/c]. 6). As usual in odes to
	Aeginetan victors, Pindar includes praise of the sons of
	Aeacus. Here he concentrates on the martial exploits of
	Achilles, which provide a transition to his praise of the
	Aeginetan sailors for their bravery during the battle of
	Salamis. The poem was therefore composed sometime after
	480. Theia, addressed in the poem’s opening, is a little
	known goddess mentioned as the mother of the Sun,
	Moon, and Dawn in Hesiod’s [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 371–374. Here she
	seems to represent the principle of light and sight. The
	designation “of many names” indicates the multitude of
	ways in which her powers are manifested.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A hymn to Theia associates her power with the luster of
	gold and with the spectacle of competing ships and chariots
	(1–6). A series of gnomic observations on the glory won
	by victorious athletes with the help of the gods leads to the
	conclusion that mortals cannot aimfor more than a portion
	of success and fame (7–16).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After briefly mentioning the victories of Phylacidas and
	Pytheas, the poet announces his desire to sing of the
	Aeacidae (17–22). A gnomic reflection on the need for
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 174[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	praising successful toil is supported by the example of
	brave warriors whose deeds have become the subjects
	of poetry (22–29). A priamel lists heroes celebrated in
	various cities and culminates in the Aeacidae, who twice
	sacked Troy (30–38). After invoking the Muse, the poet
	lists four heroes from the Trojan War and asks who defeated
	them, but instead of providing the name of Achilles
	gives that of his ancestral homeland, Aegina (38–45).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Of all that the poet could say in praise of Aegina, he singles
	out her sailors’ valor in the bloody battle of Salamis
	(46–50), but quickly stops himself from exulting and turns
	to the city’s achievements in athletics (51–54). The victor’s
	family serves as an example to aspiring athletes of the hard
	work required for success (54–58). The poet reiterates
	his praise for Phylacidas and for his brother Pytheas, who
	appears to have coached him (59–63).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]

	[b]Isthmian 6[/b]
	This is chronologically the second of the three odes
	written for the sons of Lampon. It is preceded by [c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 5
	for Phylacidas’ older brother Pytheas and followed by [c dimgray]Isth[/c].
	5 for Phylacidas’ subsequent Isthmian victory. A prominent
	theme of the ode is the greatness of sons. The opening
	simile highlights the successes of Lampon’s sons, the
	central narrative concentrates on Heracles’ prayer that
	Telamon may father a great son, and in the poem’s conclusion
	Lampon is praised for the care he lavishes on his sons.
	A parallel motif is that of a drink offering, which also appears
	in the opening, in the narrative, and at the end of the
	poem.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This ode is likened to the second of three libations at a
	symposium: the first was occasioned by Pytheas’ Nemean
	victory, the present one celebrates Phylacidas’ Isthmian
	victory, and the poet prays that a third may be called for
	by an Olympic victory (1–9). If a man’s hard work and expenditure
	lead to success and subsequent fame, then he
	has reached the limits of mortal success (10–13). Lampon
	hopes to accomplish this before he dies and the poet asks
	the Fates to fulfill that wish for his friend (14–18).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When the victor is from Aegina, the poet is obligated
	to praise the Aeacidae, whose numerous deeds are famous
	throughout the world, whether those of Peleus, Ajax, or
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 184[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b]Pindar[/b]
	Telamon (19–27), the last-mentioned of whom was Heracles’
	ally in the taking of Troy and in the destruction of the
	Meropes and of Alcyoneus (27–35). Upon coming to Telamon’s
	house to summon him to Troy, Heracles poured a
	libation and prayed that Telamon’s wife Eriboea would
	bear him a brave son (35–49). Zeus answered by sending
	an eagle ([c dimgray]aietos[/c]) and Heracles urged Telamon to name his
	son Ajax accordingly (49–56).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Citing insufficient time to recount all their deeds, the
	poet breaks off his treatment of the Aeacidae and turns to
	the two brothers and their uncle Euthymenes, whom
	he intends to praise in the briefest terms (56–59). After
	summarily listing their combined victories, which have
	brought glory in song to the clan of the Psalychiadae, their
	grandfather Themistius, and their city, he turns to their
	father Lampon, praising the diligent training he has given
	his sons and his civic-mindedness, hospitality, good sense,
	and knowledge of athletics (60–73). The poem ends with
	Pindar’s offering to them a drink of the Muses’ water from
	the fountain of Dirce at Thebes (74–75).

	a libation of honey-voiced songs.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]

	was the first libation (to Zeus, patron of the Nemean games), this
	ode is the second (celebrating Telamon and Heracles), the third,

	The occasion of the ode, Strepsiades’ victory at the
	Isthmus, is given but passing mention; instead, the poet
	concentrates on the victor’s uncle, also named Strepsiades,
	who died in battle defending his homeland of Thebes. Because
	Pindar provides no specific information about the
	battle, there is little agreement on the poem’s date.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In a lengthy priamel, the poet asks Thebe, the eponymous
	nymph of the city, which former distinction has
	pleased her most, and provides as possible answers numerous
	gods, heroes, and military successes associated with
	Thebes (1–15). After meditating on the role of song in preserving
	the memory of bygone deeds, he issues an exhortation
	to celebrate Strepsiades’ recent Isthmian victory in
	the pancratium (16–22).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet declares that the victor has shared his crown
	with his uncle of the same name who was killed in battle
	(23–25). After extolling the glory that accrues to one who
	dies defending his homeland, the poet addresses the uncle
	and compares him to the heroic warriors Meleager,
	Hector, and Amphiaraus for fighting and dying in the forefront
	of the army (26–36).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet expresses his personal grief at the elder
	Strepsiades’ death, but finds consolation in the recent victory
	and prays that the present happiness may continue

	(37–39). Speaking in the first person, the poet recommends
	enjoying each day as it comes, while avoiding overreaching
	ambitions such as those that caused Bellerophon’s
	demise (40–48). The poem ends with a prayer that
	Strepsiades may go on to win a Pythian victory (49–51).

	[b]Isthmian 8[/b]
	The dominant theme of the ode is “deliverance.” The
	prominent treatment of the war ending in the expulsion of
	the Persians in 479 provides a somber backdrop for the
	joyful celebration portrayed in the opening five lines and
	makes it likely that Cleandrus won his Isthmian victory
	in the following year. Since Thebes had joined with the
	Persians at the battle of Plataea, whereas Aegina had remained
	loyal to the Greek cause, lines 16–18 may be seen
	as justifying a Theban’s praise of Aegina by appeal to their
	past kinship. Many have seen in the myth’s broad outlines
	(a threat to divine order averted by the gods at the cost
	of death in battle) parallels with events on the historical
	level (the Persian invasion and the death of Nicocles, the
	victor’s cousin). Because Cleandrus appears to be young,
	many editors assume that his victory is in the boys’ (or
	youths’) division, but that remains uncertain.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	One of the young celebrants is told to go to Cleandrus’
	home and there begin the revel in honor of his victories at
	the Isthmus and Nemea (1–5). Although grieved, the poet
	accepts the invitation to compose this song, since it is time
	to cease from sorrow now that the gods have removed
	the Persian threat from Hellas (5–12). Although life is
	full of uncertainty, one must live in the present with confident
	hopes, especially when one has freedom (12–15a).

	[b]Pindar[/b]
	A Theban poet is obligated to praise Aegina, for their
	namesake nymphs were born as twin daughters of Asopus
	(16–21).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Praise of the Aeacidae for their bravery and good judgment
	prompts the observation that even the gods recognized
	their virtue when Zeus and Poseidon were quarreling
	over marriage to Thetis (21–29). Themis prophesied in
	the divine council that Thetis was destined to bear a son
	greater than his father, and urged the gods to marry her to
	the virtuous Peleus and let her bear his son (30–45). The
	gods assented, and the youthful exploits of her son Achilles
	became the subject of poetry (45–48). After providing a
	catalog of Achilles’ victims at Troy, the poet reports that
	the Muses sang the dirge at his funeral, since the gods
	deemed him worthy of such tribute (49–60).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Applying the same principle, the poet honors in song
	the deceased Nicocles, who is his day had been a victorious
	boxer at the Isthmus (61–65). Cleandrus has lived up to his
	cousin’s achievement and has won previous victories at
	Megara and Epidaurus (65a–68). He deserves praise for
	his youthful accomplishments (69–70).

	In honor of youthful Cleandrus, let one of you go,

	to awaken the revel, as a glorious requital
	for his efforts and a reward

	<section class="div1 front" lang="front">[b]Fragments[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	Apart from eight lines of a ninth [c dimgray]Isthmian[/c] ode preserved
	in codex D, fragments of Pindar’s poems have come to
	us from two sources: brief quotations by ancient authors
	or copies found on papyrus, particularly on those from
	Oxyrhynchus.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Since the monumental edition of Boeckh (1821), the
	fragments of the thirteen books of Pindar’s non-epinician
	poems have been arranged according to the list of works
	given in the Ambrosian life (1.3.6–9 Drachmann): hymns,
	paeans, dithyrambs (2 books), prosodia (2), partheneia (2),
	poems separate from the partheneia, hyporchemata (2),
	encomia, and threnoi.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In making selections for this edition I have included
	fragments generally believed to be from Pindar that (1) offer
	sufficient continuous text to make sense; (2) treat a god
	or other important subject; (3) are part of a longer poem;
	or (4) have a well-attested Nachleben. I have supplied very
	selective critical notes; for a full account readers are
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The list provided by P. Oxy. 2438.36–39 (first published in
	1961 and emended by I. Gallo) gives a different order and omits
	one book of hyporchemata: dithyrambs (2), prosodia (2), paeans,
	partheneia (3), encomia (in which are also skolia), hymns, hyporchemata,
	and threnoi.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 226[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]<section class="div1 front" lang="front">[b]Fragments[/b]
	referred to the edition of H. Maehler (1989), upon which the
	present work is principally based, and A. Turyn (1952).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In the case of quotations by ancient authors, I have supplied
	enough context to make clear the point of the citation
	or to add further information. Although the steady accumulation
	of new fragments and new classifications of already
	existing ones have made renumbering desirable, I
	have followed that of Maehler’s edition.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The symbol indicates the beginning or end of a fragmentary
	poem. For papyri appearing in [c dimgray]The Oxyrhynchus
	Papyri[/c], I provide the volume and year. On the Greek side
	Pindaric scholia are cited according to Heyne’s numeration
	(used by Drachmann), on the English side according
	to Maehler’s.

	which are the proper business of poetry, but that he supported
	his works with unusual words, strange usages, paraphrases,
	songs, and rhythms, which are just embellishments
	of the subject matter. So Pindar, taking her words to

	1908 by Grenfell and Hunt, which gives fragments from
	ten paeans. Many additional fragments were published in
	1961 by E. Lobel in volume 26 of [c dimgray]The Oxyrhynchus Papyri[/c],
	some of which Snell-Maehler have classed as paeans but
	are probably not.

	Abdera was settled by Teos in the sixth century and fought
	against the local Thracians to maintain itself. As a result
	of the Ionian revolt in 499 Darius destroyed Teos, but
	Abderites resettled the mother city (cf. 28–30). The poet
	recalls the colony’s previous success against Paeonians
	(61–63), a setback (63–64), and a victory in a battle at Mt.
	Melamphyllon, which was apparently predicted by Hecate
	(68–79). The poet prays for a final, decisive campaign
	against the Thracians (104–106).

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Paean 6
	52f FOR THE DELPHIANS TO PYTHO
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poem was performed at Delphi for a festival called the
	[c dimgray]theoxenia[/c], at which gods were entertained (61). The main
	narrative (79–120) concerns Apollo’s efforts to delay Troy’s
	fall and his vengeance for Priam’s death on Neoptolemus,
	who was cut down during a quarrel in Apollo’s own precinct.
	The last triad of the extant text consists of praise of
	Aegina and the Aeacidae (123–183). Scholion 150a on
	[c dimgray]Nem[/c]. 7 reads: “Aristodemus \[says\] that because he was
	blamed by the Aeginetans for having seemed in his paeans
	to say that Neoptolemus had gone to Delphi to rob the
	temple, now, as if to defend him, says that he did not die
	robbing the temple, but was killed upholding his honor
	over sacrificial meats.” From this notice and other comments
	in the scholia many scholars have argued that [c dimgray]Nem.[/c]
	7 was written to correct a slight to the Aeginetans in [c dimgray]Pae[/c]. 6,
	but no convincing case has been made for any slight in [c dimgray]Pae[/c].
	6 and the relationship of the two poems remains unclear.

	Pausanias disputes Pindar’s account about the third temple,
	supposedly made of bronze (10.5.12): “I remain unpersuaded
	by other aspects of the story, how the temple
	was the work of Hephaestus and the parts relating to the
	golden singers, which Pindar included in his song on this
	temple (‘above the pediment sang golden Charmers’).”
	Pausanias goes on to say that there were varying accounts
	of the temple’s disappearance: “Some say that it plunged
	into a chasm, others that it was melted by fire.” The fourth
	temple was built by Trophonius and Agamedes (cf. [c dimgray]fr[/c]. 2).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Pindar[/b][/c]
	The dithyramb, whose origins are obscure, is first mentioned
	in connection with drunken revelry in celebration
	of Dionysus in the mid-seventh century b.c. by
	Archilochus ([c dimgray]fr.[/c] 120West). Around 600 b.c. Arion is credited
	with introducing formal improvements and a circular
	chorus at Corinth (where at [c dimgray]Ol.[/c] 13.18–19 Pindar says
	the dithyramb was invented), while around 500 b.c. Lasus
	of Hermione (Pindar’s teacher according to the [c dimgray]Vita

	dithyrambic contests in Athens, in which, accord-

	Simonides is credited with 56 victories in dithyrambic contests,
	but not a single verse of his dithyrambs survives. The
	substantial portions of five dithyrambs and part of a sixth
	by Bacchylides (15–20) show that the mythical narratives
	need not be concerned with Dionysus. The Alexandrian
	editors collected Pindar’s dithyrambs into two rolls. For a
	detailed study, see M. J. H. Van Der Weiden, [c dimgray]The Dithyrambs

	and some even composed entire odes without sigmas.
	Pindar illustrates this when he says: ‘In the past . . . .’”
	Athenaeus, [c dimgray]Scholars at Dinner[/c]. “Regarding the poem composed
	without the letter sigma, the same Clearchus said
	that Pindar wrote the following, a kind of riddle put in lyric
	poetry, since many had criticized him for not avoiding the
	use of the letter sigma and they disapproved of it: ‘In the
	past . . . .’ One should take note of this in response to those
	who reject the asigmatic ode of Lasus of Hermione entitled
	[c dimgray]Centaurs[/c]. Also, the hymn to Demeter of Hermione
	written by Lasus contains no sigma.”

	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]Or [c dimgray]long-drawn-out[/c]. The meaning is unclear. Later authors
	use the term of poems to mean prolix (Philostr. [c dimgray]Her[/c]. 19.17) or of
	cola to mean lengthy (Hermog. [c dimgray]Inv[/c]. 1.5, 4.4).
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]The Dorians called the letter sigma [c dimgray]san[/c] (Hdt. 1.139). It is not
	clear whether Pindar is referring to Lasus of Hermione as one
	who avoided sigmas (as not being genuine) and is contrasting his
	own dithyramb (which contains them), or if he simply disapproves
	of the asigmatic dithyramb.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]Bromius, a cult name of Dionysus, means “Loud-Roarer.”

	fragments (128c and 129) already assigned to the threnoi.
	The exiguous remains of [c dimgray]Thren[/c]. 1, 2, 4, and 5 have been
	omitted here. For a detailed commentary, see M. Cannatà

	Thren. 3
	Although P. Oxy. 2447, fr. 4(b) only preserves the initial letters
	of vv. 1–5, it indicates that we have the beginning of a
	threnos. Unfortunately, the text, deriving from a scholion
	in one ms. of Euripides, is very corrupt. The opening is
	in the form of a priamel, culminating in the dirges sung
	for Calliope’s sons, Linus, Hymenaeus, Ialemus, and evidently
	for Orpheus as well.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	128c Scholion on Euripides, [c dimgray]Rhesus[/c] 895. “. . . the lament
	was named before in honor of Ialemus, the son of Apollo
	and Calliope, as Pindar says (vv. 1–11).”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There are paean-songs in due season belonging to the
	children[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	of Leto with the golden distaff; there are also songs . . .

	A golden foundation has been wrought for holy songs.
	Come, let us now construct an elaborate
	adornment that speaks words . . .
	Heracles! These words are in no way flawless, but nevertheless

	will, although it is very famous,
	exalt Thebes even more
	throughout the dwelling places of gods and men.
	As if it were not enough for it to be famous among men, but
	that the gods too would honor the city of the Thebans even
	more in the future because of him!”
