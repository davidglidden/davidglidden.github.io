I am greatly indebted to Professor J. Glenn Gray for initiatingme into the demanding art of translating Heidegger and for ourclose association over the past two years, in the cjourse of whichhis meticulous reviewing of my translations for this volume hasrescued me from many dangers but left me largely free to buildmy own way.

To Professor Gray, as well as to Professor Heidegger himself,I owe thanks for access to the unpublished transcripts of twoseminars conducted by Heidegger in France: \"Seminaire tenu parle Professeur Heidegger sur le Differenzschrift de Hegel\" and\"Seminaire tenu au Thor en septembre 1969 par le ProfesseurMartin Heidegger/\' The latter has helped provide the perspectivefor my Introduction, and both have enhanced my understandingof the five essays included here.

Those on the faculty and staff at California State University,Sacramento, who have helped and supported me in my work onthis volume are too numerous to be acknowledged each individ-ually, but I am particularly grateful to my colleague in German,Professor Olaf K. Perfler, for hours of intense conversation inwhich many secrets of the German idiom were revealed to me.

To Moira Neuterman, who was my typist from the beginningof this project almost to the last, and to Mary Ellyn McGeary,

viii Acknowledgments

her successor, are due my special thanks for exceptional skill andcare.

Every page of this book owes its final shaping in very largemeasure to the imaginative and rigorous scrutiny of my wife,Dr. Harriet Brundage Lovitt, who, though trained in anotherdiscipline, has now become indisputably a scholar and interpreterof Heidegger in her own right.

The essays in this book were taken with Heidegger\'s permissionfrom three different volumes of his works: Die Technik und dieKehre (Pfullingen: Giinther Neske, 1962); Holzwege (Frankfurt:Vittorio Klostermann, 1952); and Vortrage und Aufsatze (Pful-lingen: Giinther Neske, 1954). \'The Question Concerning Tech-nology\" is contained in both Die Technik und die Kehre andVortrage und Aufsatze.

In Die Technik und die Kehre the following prefatory noteappears regarding the two essays, \'The Question ConcerningTechnology\" (\"Die Frage nach der Technik\") and \"The Turning\"(\"Die Kehre\"):

Under the title \"Insight into That Which Is,\" the author gave, onDecember 1, 1949, in the Club at Bremen, four lectures, which wererepeated without alterations in the spring of 1950 (March 25 and26) at Biihlerhohe. The titles were \"The Thing \[\"Das Ding\"\], \"En-framing\" \[\"Das Gestell\"\], \"The Danger\" \[\"Die Gefahr\"\], \"TheTurning\" \[\"Die Kehre\"\].\*

The first lecture was given in an expanded version on lune 6,1950, before the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts. (See Vortrage undAufsatze, 1954, pp. 163 ff.)t

\* Throughout the translations in this volume parenthetical elementsinterpolated by me are shown in brackets, while those present in theauthor\'s original text are given in parentheses.

t \"The Thing\" has been published in Poetry, Language, Thought, trans.Albert Hofstadter (New York: Harper & Row, 1971), pp. 165-186.

x Preface

The second lecture was given on November 18, 1955, also in anexpanded version, under the title \'The Question Concerning Tech-nology,\" in the series entitled \"The Arts in the Technological Age.\"(See Vortrage und Aufsatzc, 1954, pp. 13 ff.). The present volumerepeats this text unaltered.

The third lecture remains still unpublished.

The fourth lecture, \"The Turning,\" is published here for the firsttime according to the first unaltered version.

At the end of Holzwege Heidegger makes the following ob-servations concerning \"The Word of Nietzsche: \'God Is Dead\' \"(\"Nietzsches Wort \'Gott ist tot7 \") and \"The Age of the WorldPicture (\"Die Zeit des Weltbildes\"):

\"The Word of Nietzsche: \'God Is Dead\' \": The major portions weredelivered repeatedly in 1943 for small groups. The content is basedupon the Nietzsche lectures that were given between 1936 and 1940during five semesters at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau.These set themselves the task of understanding Nietzsche\'s thinkingas the consummation of Western metaphysics from out of Being.

\"The Age of the World Picture\": The lecture was given on June9, 1938, under the title \"The Establishing by Metaphysics of theModern World Picture,\" as the last of a series that was arranged bythe Society for Aesthetics, Natural Philosophy, and Medicine atFreiburg im Breisgau, and which had as its theme the establishingof the modern world picture. The appendixes were written at thesame time but were not delivered.

Of all the essays in Holzwege Heidegger remarks:

In the intervening time these pieces have been repeatedly revisedand, in some places, clarified. In each case the level of reflection andthe structure have remained, and so also, together with these, hasthe changing use of language.

And at the end of Vortrage und Aufsdtze Heidegger gives thefollowing notes:

\"The Question Concerning Technology\" \[\"Die Frage nach derTechnik\"\]: Lecture held on November 18, 1955, in the main audi-torium of the Technische Hochschule, Munich, in the series \"TheArts in the Technological Age,\" arranged by the Bavarian Academyof Fine Arts under the leadership of President Emil Preetorius;published in volume III of the Yearbook of the Academy (ed. Clem-ens Graf Podewils), R. Oldenbourg, Munich, 1954, pp. 70 ff.

Preface xi

\"Science and Reflection\" \[\"Wissenschaft und Besinnung\"\]: Lecture,in its present version given in August, 1954, before a small group,in preparation for the above-mentioned conference in Munich.

William LovittSacramento, California

To read Heidegger is to set out on an adventure. The essays inthis volume---intriguing, challenging, and often baffling thereader---call him always to abandon all superficial scanning andto enter wholeheartedly into the serious pursuit of thinking.

Every philosopher demands to be read in his/own terms. Thisis especially true of Heidegger. One must not come to him withready-made labels, although these are very often given. ThusHeidegger is not an //existentialist.,, He is not concerned centrallyor exclusively with man. Rather he is centrally concerned withthe relation between man and Being, with man as the opennessto which and in which Being presences and is known. Heideggeris not a /,determinist.,, He does not believe that man\'s actionsare completely controlled by forces outside him or that man hasno effective freedom. To Heidegger man\'s life does indeed lieunder a destining sent from out of Being. But to him that destin-ing can itself call forth a self-orienting response of man that isreal and is a true expression of human freedom. Again, Heideggeris not a \"mystic.\" He does not describe or advocate the experi-encing of any sort of oneness with an absolute or infinite. Forhim both man and Being are finite, and their relationship neverdissolves in sheer oneness. Hence absolute, infinite, or the Onecan appear to him only as abstractions of man\'s thinking, andnot as realities of essential power.

xiv Introduction

Heidegger is not a \"primitive\" or a \"romantic.\" He is not onewho seeks escape from the burdens and responsibilities of con-temporary life into serenity, either through the re-creating ofsome idyllic past or through the exalting of some simple ex-perience. Finally, Heidegger is not a foe of technology andscience. He neither disdains nor rejects them as though theywere only destructive of human life.

The roots of Heidegger\'s thinking lie deep in the Westernphilosophical tradition. Yet that thinking is unique in many ofits aspects, in its language and in its literary expression. In thedevelopment of his thought Heidegger has been taught chieflyby the Greeks, by German idealism, by phenomenology, and bythe scholastic theological tradition. These and other elementshave been fused by his genius of sensitivity and intellect intovery individual philosophical expression.

In approaching Heidegger\'s work the reader must ask not onlywhat he says, but how he says it. For here form and content areinextricably united. The perceptive reader will find at hand inthe literary form of each one of these essays many keys to un-lock its meaning. He will also find the content of each continuallyshaping for itself forms admirably suited to its particular ex-pression.

For Heidegger true thinking is never an activity performed inabstraction from reality. It is never man\'s ordering of abstrac-tions simply in terms of logical connections. Genuine thinking is,rather, man\'s most essential manner of being man. Rigorouslydemanding and but rarely attained, it manifests the relation be-tween man and Being. In true thinking man is used by Being,which needs man as the openness that provides the measure andthe bounds for Being\'s manifesting of itself in whatever is. Manin thinking is called upon to lend a helping hand to Being. In-deed, Heidegger can refer to thinking as handcraft. As such,thinking is man\'s fundamental responding to whatever offersitself to him. Informed by recollection, it brings forth into aware-ness and efficacy whatever is presented to it to know. It is thecaretaking hand that receives and holds and shapes everythingthat truly comes to be and to be known. Through that receivingand shaping of whatever is present, thinking, as belonging to

Introduction xv

and needed by Being, cooperates in the handing out of limitsand the setting of bounds.

Here Being is in no sense to be thought of as an entity of somesort. Nor is it to be simply identified with any element or aspector totality of the reality that we ordinarily know. Rather Beingis the Being of whatever is. Ruling in whatever is, yet transcend-ing and governing the latter in the particularity of its presencing,Being may perhaps best be said to be the ongoing manner inwhich everything that is, presences; i.e., it is the manner in which,in the lastingness of time, everything encounters man and comesto appearance through the openness that man provides. Hencefor Heidegger Being is the very opposite of an abstractionfashioned by human thought. Rather it is \"what is given tothinking to think.\" True thinking should not concern itself withsome arcane and hidden meaning, but with \"something lyingnear, that which lies nearest,\" which, in virtue of that verynearness, man\'s thinking can readily fail to notice at all (WN111).\* Being rules in whatever is---in the particular and in thefar-ranging complexity of the whole---thereby constantly ap-proaching and concerning man. \"In the \'is,\' \" spoken of anythingreal whatever, \" \'Being\' is uttered\" (T 46).

Being manifests itself continually anew. In keeping with this,thinking can never be for Heidegger a closed system. Rather itis the traveling of a road. Each thinker goes along a way that ispeculiarly his own. In a fundamental sense it is the way and notthe individual that assembles what is thought, that providesbounds and lets everything stand in relation to everything else.

Heidegger\'s writings exemplify this centrality of the way for

xvi Introduction

him. Characteristically he writes essays, excursions of thought.Each of the five essays in the present volume is of this nature.The five center around the theme of technology and the modernage, yet in reading each of them we travel a particular path. Eachis distinctive and self-contained, and must be read in and foritself. In each, innumerable details of word and phrase and struc-ture at once both arise from and reveal what Heidegger is saying.

Heidegger is primarily a teacher. He does not wish to travelalone and then report what he has seen, nor does he wish to goas a guide merely pointing out objects along the road. He wishesthe reader to accompany him on the way, to participate with him,and even to begin to build his own way through thinking, andnot merely to hear about what it is or should be.

Being approaches and concerns us in whatever is, yet Beingcharacteristically conceals itself even in so doing. Hence thinkingcannot readily find it out. The way through thinking to that placewhere man can open himself to the ruling of Being is diffi-cult. It leads often through unfamiliar and even perilous country.We modern men are far from that open clearing. We are trappedand blinded by a mode of thought that insists on grasping realitythrough imposed conceptual structures. We cannot and will notcome to that place where we can let what is, be. We do not per-ceive that the way by which true thinking proceeds can itselfprove to be the source of that unity which we, often frenziedly,strive after in our philosophy, in our science, and in every aspectof our activity.

In order to prepare us truly to think, Heidegger, in keepingwith the best speculative tradition, often carries us beyond ourfacile conceiving to seek the ground of our thinking. But he doesmore. He confronts us repeatedly with an abyss. For he strivesto induce us to leap to new ground, to think in fresh ways.Hence, again and again, as we travel with him through theseessays some precipice will confront us. One must often clamberthrough dark sayings and scale absurdities if one would followon these paths. This is a daunting prospect. Yet Heidegger hashope for those who go with him. For the ground he seeks toachieve belongs fundamentally to man as man. Hence he callseach of us who reads to come and find it out.

Introduction xvii

Heidegger\'s writing is intrinsically sequential, always moving insome particular direction. Therefore one must discover meaningas one moves forward. One must experience the turnings of thesepaths just where they happen. No element can properly be ex-cerpted and considered in isolation, and none can properly beleft out of account; for each element plays its part in the forwardmovement. Words and sentences must always be read in contextif one hopes to apprehend the meaning that they bear.

In this building forward of thinking there is always a pattern.Sometimes it is closely and intricately woven, as in \'The Turn-ing/7 Sometimes, as in \"The Question Concerning Technology\"or \"The Word of Nietzsche: \'God Is Dead/\" it is far-ranging,involving long, complex discussions whose interconnections canbe hard to discern. At times bewilderment may seize even thethoughtful reader. Yet he must remember that, on each particularpath, Heidegger himself never loses his way and never forgetsin what direction he is going. He never abandons the sequenceof his themes, never forgets what he has previously said, andnever forsakes the pattern of his work. Everything fits, oftenwith great precision, into that pattern. For Heidegger is alwaysworking out of the wholeness provided by the delimiting waypursued.

Heidegger must build and is content to build finitely. How-ever intricate the relationships to be expressed, however mani-fold the given meaning, he must set forth one facet at a time.There is tremendous rigor in his work. Therefore he makes greatdemands on those who follow him. Yet the reader who perseveresmay hope to experience the excitement of discovery as he findshimself intimately engaged in the pursuit of thinking.

Because Heidegger is eager that the reader should follow himand sensible that the way is hard, again and again he speaks soas to evoke a response that will carry his companion forward.Often at some key point he will ask a question, seeking to forcethe reader to come to grips with what is being said, to think, toreply, and then to listen for an answer that will send the discus-sion forward: \"Does this mean that man, for better or worse, ishelplessly delivered over to technology?\" (T 37). \"In what doesthe essence of modern science lie?\" (AWP 117). \"What is hap-

xviii Introduction

pening to Being?\" (WN 104). When we come upon such ques-tions we must listen alertly. A question may be answered in animmediately ensuing sentence, or its answer may emerge onlyafter an involved exposition. But an answer will come. And itwill be important to the whole discussion.

Sometimes Heidegger speaks with sharp emphasis, to indicatethat a point must be heard: \"never can it be sufficientlystressed . . .\" (5R 160), \"a confrontation with Christendom isabsolutely not in any way . . .\" (WN 64), \"never does the Beingof that which is consist . . .\" (AWP 130). Such words demandour closest attention.

Again, Heidegger has many devices for catching the reader upand jolting him from his habitual frame of mind. \"But wherehave we strayed to?\" he will ask, after a sequence of thought hasdrawn to an expected conclusion (QT 12). Or he will interjectsome sharp assertion: \"for centuries we have acted as thoughthe doctrine of the four causes had fallen from heaven as a truthas clear as daylight\" (QT 6)---and he thereby calls in questionour unconsidered assumptions. At one point he will echo whatwe are thinking, only to amplify it with a word that moves itinto another dimension: Yes, the instrumental definition of tech-nology is \"correct\"; it is \"indeed so uncannily correct\"---and theword \"uncanny,\" even if forgotten, hangs over the portrayal ofthe skeletal power into whose domain we look in words thateventually follow (QT 5, 19 ff.). At another point he will thrustat the foundations of our thinking with a quick reversal ofthought, hoping to dislodge us and bring us to new ground:\"Modern physics is called mathematical because, in a remark-able way, it makes use of a quite specific mathematics. But itcan proceed mathematically in this way only because, in a deepersense, it is already itself mathematical\" (AWP 118)---and we arecompelled to ask, What is he saying with this puzzling assertion?

Sometimes such thrusts are all but beyond our comprehension:\"The essence of technology is by no means anything techno-logical\" (QT 4); \"Physics as physics can make no assertionsabout physics\" (SR 176). Such words may even, when heardsuperficially, sound like mere cleverness or arrogant nonsense.More seriously confronted, such statements may fairly halt thereader in dismay and exasperation. \"I know this man must be

Introduction xix

wrong,\" he may protest, \"if he says that the essence of tech-nology has nothing to do with technology. He can\'t be sayingthat. But what is he saying? I am willing to do as I was asked, tofollow, to question, to build a way. But what can I do with anopaque statement like that? The essence of technology is by nomeans anything technological7!\" Yet in such opaque statementsthe meaning of the way is often most deeply lodged. Again thereader has been forced to ask, to look for the ranges of meaningwithin seemingly familiar words. Never should it be thoughtthat at such junctures Heidegger is merely playing with words.For him, rather, language plays with us. The swiftly turnedphrase is not a roadblock. It is another, if enigmatic, signpost.It is a statement opaque only by reason of fullness, intended toguide the reader forward in search of the meaning that it bodiesforth.

Access to the way to which Heidegger wishes to introduce us,the way to thinking and to a free relationship with Being, liesthrough language. For thinking is man\'s according with andresponding to Being, and \"language is the primal dimension\" inwhich that responsive corresponding takes place (T 41).

Heidegger has a poet\'s ear for language and often writes ina poetic way. For him the proper function of words is not tostand for, to signify. Rather, words point to something beyondthemselves. They are translucent bearers of meaning. To name athing is to summon it, to call it toward one. Heidegger\'s wordsare rich in connotation. Once inclined to invent words to carryneeded meanings, he has more recently become concerned withthe rehabilitation of language, with the restoring of its original,now obliterated force.

Repeatedly he tells us of the ancient and fundamental mean-ings of words, carefully setting forth nuances or tracing historicalchanges that took place as thought passed from one language toanother. Our word \"technology,\" we learn, rests back upon theGreek techne. Our \"cause,\" from the Latin causa, translates theGreek aition, which has a very different meaning. \"Essence,\"\"theory,\" \"reflection,\" the \"real\"---word after word is searchedout to its roots and defined and used according to its latentmeanings. In all this Heidegger is of course no mere antiquarian.

xx Introduction

He has said that language is the house of Being. The reciprocalrelation between Being and man is fulfilled through language.Hence to seek out what language is, through discovering whatwas spoken in it when it first arose and what has been and canbe heard in it thereafter, is in fact to seek out that relationship.It is to endeavor to place oneself where the utterance of Beingmay be heard and expressed.

Heidegger chooses---he himself might say \"discovers\"---wordsthat are as expressive as possible. Often he defines them withgreat precision. Sometimes he points out facets of meaning thatare clearly present in a German word, as in verschulden (to beresponsible or indebted), wirken (to work or bring about), orbesinnen (to reflect; from sinnen, to scent out or sense) QT 7;5R 159, 180). Sometimes he presses a word forward to encom-pass new meanings that he hears within it, as with Bestand (stock,now become standing-reserve), or Gestell (frame, now becomeEnframing), or Geschick (fate, now become the self-adaptivedestining of Being) (QT 17,19, 24; T 37-38).

Heidegger\'s use of words is very often peculiar to himself. Itis characteristically demanding and often strange to our thought.The words that meet us in his essays are not intended to mystifyhis readers or to attract devotees who will facilely repeat esotericspeech. Yet Heidegger is acutely aware that his words may wellbe seized upon and used in just such ways: we must, he says,keep from \"hastily recasting the language of the thinker in thecoin of a terminology,\" immediately repeating some new andimpressive word \"instead of devoting all our efforts to thinkingthrough what has been said.\"1

Since words are in no sense abstractions, but rather show theBeing of that of which they speak, Heidegger can and doesemploy them variously so as to bring out particular aspects oftheir meaning at particular points. But he uses them consistentlyaccording to his understanding of the meaning that they carry;and nuances that fall away at any given time nevertheless alwaysremain alive and must be continually heard. We must readHeidegger\'s definitions and study his ways of using words withcare. For these alone, and not our own preconceptions and in-grained notions of meaning, will tell us what words like \"truth\"

1\. \"The Onto-theo-logical Constitution of Metaphysics,\" in Identity andDifference, pp. 73-74.

Introduction xxi

or \"essence\" or \"technology\" or \"metaphysics\" are conveyinghere.

In this situation the non-German reader is of course at apeculiar disadvantage. A translator is inexorably forced to chooseamong many aspects of connotation for word upon word and torecast sentence after sentence into a very different mold. Parallelwords and even rather lengthy phrases have sometimes beenused here to render single German words in order to displayadequately their breadth of meaning. Every attempt has beenmade to maintain consistency in the translation of given wordsand to mirror as faithfully as possible the inner emphases ofconstruction resident in the German text. Yet despite all suchefforts, the evocative power of the original word, as often of theoriginal stress and turn of phrase, can scarcely be preserved forthe English-speaking reader. In these essays, footnotes and cita-tions of the original German have been provided to help thereader at crucial points. The essays have been translated withcare, and it is hoped that much of Heidegger\'s meaning lies withinthese pages, even though the fullness of the original Germanmust be lacking. It goes without saying that anyone who wishesto know Heidegger\'s work well must read and study the Germantext.

When all this has been said, it must be added that the firstproblem of the reader of this English volume is apt to lie, not inthe fact that he is reading Heidegger in translation, but in thefact that in reading Heidegger he is encountering words that hemust learn to let come to him with fresh meaning. Definitionand context remain to give considerable aid. Moreover, even inthe language of translation the expressiveness of many of Hei-degger\'s words can reach us with genuine power. If we can learn,with whatever difficulty, to think truth as unconcealment oressence as the manner in which something endures in coming topresence; if we can let words like \"technology\" or \"destining\"or \"danger\" sound with the meaning Heidegger intends, thensomething of that power will be present for us.

Very often Heidegger uses words that point to realities or re-lations beyond those of which they immediately speak. On occas-sion a pair of words will be found, each of which, if we aretruly listening, more or less clearly suggests and reenforces theother. Words like \"unconcealing\" and \"concealing,\" \"pres-

xxii Introduction

encing\" and \"withdrawing,\" are intended variously to act in thisway. More importantly, such words, like many others, also havea two-wayness that permits them to point at once to Being and toman. Thus \"presenting\" and \"revealing\" speak simultaneouslyof a moving into presence or unconcealment and of one towardwhom that movement takes place, while \"concealing\" and \"with-drawing\" tell of a movement away and remind of one who isbeing deprived of that which might be present or revealed.

Often this breadth of expressiveness possessed by Heidegger\'slanguage can help the attentive reader to make his way throughdifficult passages. In \"The Turning,\" for example, throughoutthe especially difficult sequence in which we are told of whatcomes to pass in the turning of the danger that is the essence oftechnology, almost no overt allusion is made to the role of man(T 41-47). That role is set forth in the opening pages of theessay (pp. 36-41), but it could easily be let slip from view as thereader follows the intricate discussion. Throughout that verydiscussion, however, a whole series of words---\"light,\" \"in-flashing,\" \"glance,\" \"insight\"---appears. And these can serve toremind one of a lighting up that both shines forth and is seen.These words speak specifically of what happens in the turningwithin Being itself. But they also sustain for us, if but hiddenly,the memory of man\'s necessary involvement in what is comingto pass, until the human role is again taken up and broughtforward (T 47).

Heidegger makes particular use of prepositions and adverbs,standing either alone or as components of verbs, to speak thusof fundamental relations, even when those relations themselvesare not under discussion. Such words as \"into,\" \"from out of,\"\"toward,\" \"forth,\" \"out,\" and \"hither\" will be met with fre-quently in these pages. They should be carefully noted, for theycan embody with peculiar force the apprehension of reality outof which Heidegger is speaking.

Poet that he is, Heidegger often speaks the same words againand again and again. Repetition gives emphasis. A word intro-duced at one point and then taken up only later into full discus-sion gains in richness through that early introduction, for itspresence threads all but unnoticed through the pattern of inter-vening thought. The same phrases are used now, then used again;

Introduction xxiii

yet they are not really the same. The later phrase is always fullerin meaning by reason of all that has been said since its wordswere first spoken. This cumulative power of repetition can beseen strikingly when Heidegger returns at the close of an essayto words and themes that sound toward its beginning (cf. T,WN). Such words speak with new eloquence when we find themthus at the conclusion of an arduous path.

Above all, the reader must not grow deaf to Heidegger\'s words;he must not let their continual repetition or their appearance inall but identical phrases lull him into gliding effortlessly on,oblivious to the subtle shifts and gatherings of meaning that areconstantly taking place.

A number of terms that we have used thus far point to funda-mental characteristics in Heidegger\'s thinking that must becomeintegral to one\'s own outlook if one would enter into and gainsome understanding of his work. We have spoken of the \"way\"that \"assembles,, and relates things to one another. We havealluded to \"wholeness,\" to \"pattern,\" to the expressing of facetsof thought in finite \"sequence.\" We have discussed the \"two-wayness\" of particular words, and the \"richness of connotation\"inherent in Heidegger\'s language generally. All these are butparticular manifestations of a thinking that is essentially inclu-sive and essentially rooted in the discerning of relations. On theground where Heidegger moves, reality does not appear as com-posed of discrete elements or aspects that are linked by causeand effect connections. For Heidegger thinking is not primarilydeductive, although he often shows himself to be a master atelucidating the implications of a statement or thought. For himthe primary question to be asked is always how and never why.His is descriptive and evocative thinking, in the sense that it tellsus of what is and of what is taking place, and seeks to bring itbefore us. The reality described is manifold. Aspects impingeupon one another. Movements and interactions are what mustfundamentally be recounted.

But these interrelations always involve some intricate unity.The inherence of something in something else or the manifesta-tion in the present of what has long been present, the samenessof various and even opposite manifestations or the oneness of

xxiv Introduction

subtly diverse occurrences---such things are here to be met withat every turn.

Once more the reader may be tempted to say, \"What non-sense !\" One should be wary, however, of leaping hastily to anysuch conclusion. So pervasively does unitive, relational thinkinginform every aspect of Heidegger\'s work that one who dismissedsuch thinking out of hand would risk extinguishing for himselfany hope of understanding what Heidegger is saying. The readermust in fact become so alert to inclusive complexities of thoughtthat he will be sensitive to their presence even when they do notmanifestly appear.

Heidegger, as is typical of him, is concerned in the essaysbefore us with the understanding of Western history and West-ern thought. We ordinarily think of the modern age, \"the age ofscience and technology,\" as one that began a few centuries agoand that is unquestionably new. Heidegger too can speak of anew departure in the modern age; yet for him to say this is topoint at the same time to the coming into overt expression of atendency whose true origin lies decisively if hiddenly in Greekantiquity.

The fundamental Greek experience of reality was, Heideggerbelieves, one in which men were immediately responsive to what-ever was presencing to them. They openly received whateverspontaneously met them (AWP 131).

For the Greeks the coming into the \"present\" out of the \"not-present\" was poisesis (QT 10). This \"bringing forth\" was mani-fest first of all in physis, that presencing wherein the bursting-forth arose from within the thing itself. Techne was also a formof this bringing forth, but one in which the bursting-forth laynot in the thing itself but in another. In techne, through art andhandcraft, man participated in conjunction with other contribut-ing elements---with \"matter,\" \"aspect,\" and \"circumscribingbounds\"---in the bringing forth of a thing into being (QT 7-8).Moreover the arts of the mind were called techne also (QT 13).

Greek man openly received and made known that whichoffered itself to him. Yet nevertheless he tended in the face ofthe onrush of the revealing of Being in all that met him to seekto master it. It is just this tendency toward mastery that showsitself in Greek philosophy. Philosophy sprang from the funda-

Introduction xxv

mental Greek experience of reality. The philosopher wondered atthe presencing of things and, wondering, fixed upon them. (That,Heidegger remarks, is why Thales tumbled into a well! \[Sem11\]). The philosopher sought to grasp and consider reality, todiscover whatever might be permanent within it, so as to knowwhat it truly was. But precisely in so doing he distanced himselffrom Being, which was manifesting itself in the presencing of allparticular beings. For in his seeking, he reached out not simplyto receive with openness, but also to control. Here, to Heideg-ger\'s thinking, lies the real origin of the modern technologicalage. Techne was a skilled and thorough knowing that disclosed,that was, as such, a mode of bringing forth into presencing, amode of revealing. Philosophy, as a thinking that consideredreality and therewith made it manifest in its Being, was technealso in its own way. In the Western tradition, the metaphysicalthinking born of that philosophy carried forward the expressionof techne into modern times.

Heidegger finds Christian theology to be wholly dominated bymetaphysics during the centuries after the beginning of theChristian era. In the medieval period men were preoccupied withthe question of how they might be in right relationship with God,how they might be assured of salvation, i.e., how they might findenduring security. At the close of that period the overt theologicalundergirding of these questions fell away, but the quest forsecurity remained. Man needed a new basis for his self-assurance,his assurance of Tightness. The work of Descartes, itself an ex-pression of the shift in men\'s outlook that had already takenplace, set forth that basis in philosophical terms (WN 88-90).

In the ego cogito \[ergo\] sum of Descartes, man found his self-certainty within himself. Man\'s thinking (cogitare), which Hei-degger says was also a \"driving together\" (co-agitare), was foundto contain within itself the needed sureness. Man could representreality to himself, that is, he could set it up over against himself,as it appeared to him, as an object of thought. In so doing, hefelt assured at once of his own existence and of the existence ofthe reality thus conceived (AWP 131).

It is in this that Heidegger sees the focal point for the begin-ning of the modern age. The tendency present in metaphysicsfrom its inception here begins to come to fulfillment. Man, once

xxvi Introduction

concerned to discover and decisively to behold the truly real, nowfinds himself certain of himself; and he takes himself, in thatself-certainty, to be more and more the determining center ofreality.

This stance of man in the midst of all that is bespeaks the factthat man has become \"subject.\" The phenomenon of the \"sub-ject\" is itself not new. It was present among the Greeks. Butthere subject, hypokeimenon, that-whicli-lies-before (for theGreeks, that which looms up, e.g., an island or mountain), meantthe reality that confronted man in the power of its presence (cf.Sem. 7). With Descartes at the beginning of the modern period,this meaning of hypokeimenon, subject, was decisively trans-formed.

Descartes fixed his attention not on a reality beyond himself,but precisely on that which was present as and within his ownconsciousness. At this point human self-consciousness becamesubject par excellence, and everything that had the character ofsubject---of that-which-lies-before---came to find the locus andmanner of its being precisely in that self-consciousness, i.e., inthe unity of thinking and being that was established by Descartesin his ego cogito \[ergo\] sum, through which man was continuallyseeking to make himself secure. Here man became what he hasbeen increasingly throughout our period. He became subject, theself-conscious shaper and guarantor of all that comes to himfrom beyond himself (AWP 147 ff.).

Modern science is for Heidegger a work of man as subject inthis sense. Modern man as scientist, through the prescribed pro-cedures of experiment, inquires of nature to learn more and moreabout it. But in so doing he does not relate himself to nature asthe Greek related himself to the multitudinous presencing ofeverything that met him spontaneously at every turn. He doesnot relate to nature in the openness of immediate response. Forthe scientist\'s \"nature\" is in fact, Heidegger says, a humanconstruction. Science strikingly manifests the way in whichmodern man as subject represents reality. The modern scientistdoes not let things presence as they are in themselves. He arreststhem, objectifies them, sets them over against himself, preciselyby representing them to himself in a particular way. Moderntheory, Heidegger says, is an \"entrapping and securing refining

Introduction xxvii

of the real\" (5R 167). Reality as \"nature\" is represented as amanifold of cause and effect coherences. So represented, naturebecomes amenable to experiment. But this does not happensimply because nature intrinsically is of this character; rather ithappens, Heidegger avers, specifically because man himselfrepresents nature as of this character and then grasps and in-vestigates it according to methods that, not surprisingly, fitperfectly the reality so conceived.

Here, science (Wissenschaft) means any discipline or branchof knowledge. In speaking of science, Heidegger can refer asoften to the discipline of history, with its representing of his-torical events as causal sequences, as he does to physics and itsrelated disciplines with their respective ways of representingnature.

The intricate system of techniques and apparatus that we callmodern technology belongs essentially to this same realm. Init contemporary man\'s inveterate drive to master whatever con-fronts him is plain for all to see. Technology treats everythingwith \"objectivity.\" The modern technologist is regularly ex-pected, and expects himself, to be able to impose order on alldata, to \"process\" every sort of entity, nonhuman and humanalike, and to devise solutions for every kind of problem. He isforever getting things under control.

Heidegger\'s portrayal of the beginnings of the modern ageand of its characteristic phenomena often so sharply stresses theself-exalting and restrictive role of man that his thinking canseem not unlike that of those who unconditionally condemn\"Cartesian abstraction\" and decry the pernicious tendency ofscience and technology to cut man off from vital awareness ofthe real (AWP 118 ff., SR 169 ff.). But for Heidegger that simplestress never stands alone. Its seeming simplicity in fact masksa concomitant hidden truth that actually belies any such sim-plicity. Always for Heidegger---even when he most vividly de-scribes how man as subject has brought the modern age intobeing and how he now shapes and dominates its phenomena---the primal relationship between man and Being lies as near athand and demands as much to be taken into account as it doeswhen he speaks of the ancient Greeks and of their immediateresponsiveness to the ruling of Being in whatever was presencing

xxviii Introduction

to them. However extensively Heidegger may speak about man,his thinking and his doing, he never loses sight of the truth that\"in the \'is\' \" of everything that is, \" \'Being\' is uttered.\"

Modern technology, like ancient techne, from which it springs---and like science and metaphysics, which are essentially onewith it---is a mode of revealing. Being, through its manner ofruling in all that is, is manifesting itself within it.

That which has come to fruition in Descartes and in all of us,his modern successors, not only took its rise long before in atemporal sense. It also took its rise long in advance from beyondman (QT 14). For in its fulfillment Heidegger sees the holding-sway of a \"destining\" or \"sending forth\" of Being, that has comeupon man and molded him and his world (QT 24).

In the time of the Greeks the philosophers did not simply im-pose categories like idea upon reality so as to make it accessibleto themselves in the way they wished. Rather, that which every-where met them in its Being so offered itself as to call forth theirthought in just those ways. In the same manner, in the modern\"Cartesian\" scientific age man does not merely impose his ownconstruction upon reality. He does indeed represent reality tohimself, refusing to let things emerge as they are. He does for-ever catch reality up in a conceptual system and find that hemust fix it thus before he can see it at all. But man does this bothas his own work and because the revealing now holding sway atonce in all that is and in himself brings it about that he shoulddo so. This simultaneous juxtaposing of the destining of Beingand the doing of man is absolutely fundamental for Heidegger\'sthinking.

We ordinarily understand modern technology as having arisensubsequently to science and as subordinate to it. We consider itto be a phenomenon brought about through scientific advance.Heidegger points out that, on the contrary, modern science andmachine technology are mutually dependent upon one another.More importantly, technology, in its essence, precedes and ismore fundamental than science. This is no mere statement con-cerning chronological priority, for the \"essence of technology\"is the very mode of Being\'s revealing of itself that is holdingsway in all phenomena of the modern age. Man\'s arrogation tohimself of the role of subject in philosophy; his objectifying of

Introduction xxix

nature, life, and history in dealing with them in the sciences;and his calculating and cataloguing and disposing of all mannerof things through machine technology---all these alike are ex-pressions of that essence and of that revealing. Technology, sounderstood, is in no sense an instrument of man\'s making or inhis control. It is rather that phenomenon, ruled from out ofBeing itself, that is centrally determining all of Western history.

Modern technology in its essence is a \"challenging revealing.\"It involves a contending with everything that is. For it \"setsupon\" everything, imposing upon it a demand that seizes andrequisitions it for use. Under the dominion of this \^challengingrevealing, nothing is allowed to appear as it is in itself.

The rule of such a way of revealing is seen when man be-comes subject, when from out of his consciousness he assumesdominion over everything outside himself, when he representsand objectifies and, in objectifying, begins to take control overeverything. It comes to its fulfillment when, as is increasingly thecase in our time, things are not even regarded as objects, becausetheir only important quality has become their readiness for use.Today all things are being swept together into a vast networkin which their only meaning lies in their being available to servesome end that will itself also be directed toward getting every-thing under control. Heidegger calls this fundamentally un-differentiated supply of the available the \"standing-reserve\"(QT17).

The ordering of everything as standing-reserve, like objectify-ing itself, is once more a manifestation of a destining. It is firstof all the bringing to fruition of a way of appearing that is givento everything that is, from out of Being itself. But as such, it doesnot, of course, take place simply outside of or apart from man.The same destining that gives this mode of appearing to what-ever is also rules in him, provoking him to order everything injust this way, as standing-reserve. The challenging claim thatnow summons man forth, that \"gathers man thither to order theself-revealing as standing-reserve,\" Heidegger calls das Ge-stell(Enframing) (QT 19). As \"Enframing,\" that claim ceaselesslybrings both men and things to take their places in the starkconfiguration that is being wrought out through ordering for use.

This challenging summons, ruling in modern technology, is

xxx Introduction

a mode of Being\'s revealing of itself. Yet in it, also, Being with-draws, so that the summons that thus \"enframes\" is all but de-void of Being as empowering to be. Compelled by its claim,ordered and orderer alike are denuded. All that is and manhimself are gripped in a structuring that exhibits a mere skeletonof their Being, of the way in which they intrinsically are. In allthis the essence of technology rules.

The dominion of Enframing as the essence of modern tech-nology and the concomitant presence of the standing-reserve aremost clearly seen in the realm of machine technology, where noobject has significance in itself and where the \"orderability\" ofeverything, from energy and statistics to machines and persons,is all-important. It can be found also, Heidegger says, in thesphere of science, namely, in modern physics. There again, theobject, otherwise the hallmark of the sciences, has disappeared.In its stead the relation between subject and object comes to thefore and \"becomes a standing-reserve\" to be controlled (SR 173).

In metaphysics too the rule of the essence of technology ap-pears. Perhaps rather surprisingly, Heidegger finds in Nietzschethe culmination of the movement of modern metaphysics begunin Descartes and carried forward by subsequent thinkers. Stand-ing within the modern metaphysical outlook, Nietzsche, in askingconcerning the reality of the real, found the will to be funda-mentally determinative. The self-consciousness of the subject,which Descartes established as normative, is raised in Nietzscheto full metaphysical expression. Self-consciousness is here theself-consciousness of the will willing itself. The will to power,fundamental for Nietzsche, is no mere human willing. It is themode of Being now ruling in everything that is, which must findaccomplishment through man (WN 96-97).

In striving ever forward in and to greater power, the will topower must---indeed in the most extreme manner---act in thevery way that Heidegger finds characteristic of metaphysicalthinking as such. In positing for itself the preservation-enhance-ment conditions of life that attend its own necessary advance,the will to power cannot and does not receive what comes to itand leave it to its spontaneously flowing presencing. Rather itmust arrest it, delimit it, make it into a constant reserve, intothat on the basis of which it itself moves forward (WN 83 ff.).

Introduction xxxi

The establishing of the conditions necessary for the will topower\'s willing of itself is thought of by Nietzsche as value-positing.

Nietzsche designates as \"nihilism\" the devaluing of the trans-cendent values imposed on man by traditional metaphysicalthinking; and he calls \"completed nihilism\" the \"revaluing,\"accomplished in his own thinking, that at once guards against aslipping back into those former values and provides an affirma-tive basis for the positing of new values. For Heidegger, Nietzscheactually displays in his \"completed nihilism\" a yet more extremeform of nihilism whose character he does not himself suspect.Despite his desire to overcome metaphysics, Nietzsche standssquarely in the metaphysical tradition, for he continues to thinkin terms of valuing. He can indeed take Being to be a value, acondition posited in the will to power for its own preservationand enhancement. The Being of everything, far from being arevealing presencing to be freely received, becomes a determina-tive aim in view that must lead always to some further end.Here self-consciousness---which as subject sets itself and every-thing present to it before itself, that it may make itself secure---comes, in the mode of the will to power, to take disposal, in itsvalue-positing, even over Being.

It is just this thinking that is for Heidegger in the highestdegree \"nihilistic.\" In it Being has been degraded into a value(cf. WN 102-104); Being cannot be Being; i.e., the power ofeverything whatever to presence directly in its Being has beendestroyed by a thinking that would find every aspect and char-acteristic of reality to be at the disposal and service of the finalexpression of the subjectness of the subject as self-securing self-consciousness---the will to power. Nietzsche\'s anticipated \"over-man,\" embodying in himself the determining power once sup-posed to lie in the realm of transcendent values, would actualizethis subjectness.

In this way Heidegger sees in Nietzsche\'s philosophy the com-pletion and consummation of metaphysics, and that must meanalso the consummation of the essence of technology. Nietzsche\'soverman might be said to be technological man par excellence.The name \"overman\" does not designate an individual. Ratherit names that humanity which, as modern humanity, is now be-

xxxii Introduction

ginning to enter upon the consummation of the modern age (cfWN 96). Overman would consciously will and would havedominion and disposal over all things as the one fully manifestinthe will to power.

Once again the thinking that degrades Being and in effectdestroys it as Being is not a merely human doing. Indeed, Hei-degger sees in the fact that Nietzsche\'s work, for all its boldnewness, only brings to culmination tendencies present in meta-physics from its beginning, striking evidence that the obstructing,yes, the very absence, of Being in its manifestation in Westernthinking derives from Being itself. Precisely as with the challeng-ing revealing of Enframing, the power that, even in his highestmetaphysical thinking, thrusts man forward as value-positingand hence fundamentally as \"ordering for use\"---and that simul-taneously brings it about that nothing that is can appear as itis in itself, and that man must conceive and determine everythingin this controlling way---is the very destining of Being itselfthat is holding sway more and more pervasively in the modernage.

Heidegger sees every aspect of contemporary life, not onlymachine technology and science but also art, religion, and cultureunderstood as the pursuit of the highest goods, as exhibitingclear marks of the ruling essence of technology that holds swayin the dominion of man as self-conscious, representing subject.Everywhere is to be found the juxtaposing of subject and objectand the reliance on the experience and the evaluating judgmentof the subject as decisive. The presencing of everything that ishas been cut at its roots. Men speak, significantly enough, of a\"world picture\" or \"world view.\" Only in the modern age couldthey speak so. For the phrase \"world picture\" means just this:that what is, in its entirety---i.e., the real in its every aspect andelement---now is \"taken in such a way that it first is in being andonly is in being to the extent that it is set up by man, whorepresents and sets forth\" (AWP 129-130, italics mine). Werecontemporary man seriously to become aware of this character ofhis life and of his thinking, he might, with the modern physicist,well say, \"It seems as though man everywhere and always en-counters only himself\" (QT 27).

Introduction xxxiii

Such a judgment would, however, be a delusion. Man in fact\'\'can never encounter only himself\" (QT 27). For man is sum-moned, claimed, in the challenging revealing of Enframing evenwhen he knows it not, even when he thinks himself most aloneor most dreams of mastering his world. Man\'s obliviousness tothat claim is itself a manifestation of the rule of Enframing. Socompletely has he been drawn into that dominion that he isactually cut off from awareness of his own essence. For he isestranged from Being even while Being, in the self-withdrawn-ness of its challenging self-revealing, is so encountering him thathe is in fact being constrained to bring about the dominion ofthat revealing---i.e., is being claimed by it. For this reason, mandoes not know himself as the one who is being brought intorelation to Being; that is, he does not know himself as man.Ruled in this way, man today, despite what seems true to him,never encounters himbelf, i.e., his essence.

Man needs above all in our age to know himself as the onewho is so claimed. The challenging summons of Enframing\"sends into a way of revealing\" (QT 24). So long as man doesnot know this, he cannot know himself; nor can he know himselfin relation to his world. As a consequence he becomes trapped inone of two attitudes, both equally vain: either he fancies that hecan in fact master technology and can by technological means---by analyzing and calculating and ordering---control all aspects ofhis life; or he recoils at the inexorable and dehumanizing controlthat technology is gaining over him, rejects it as the work of thedevil, and strives to discover for himself some other way of lifeapart from it. What man truly needs is to know the destiningto which he belongs and to know it as a destining, as the dis-posing power that governs all phenomena in this technologicalage.

A destining of Being is never a blind fate that simply compelsman from beyond himself. It is, rather, an opening way in whichman is called upon to move to bring about that which is takingplace. For man to know himself as the one so called upon is forhim to be free. For Heidegger freedom is not a matter of man\'swilling or not willing particular things. Freedom is man\'s openinghimself---his submitting himself in attentive awareness---to the

xxxiv Introduction

summons addressed to him and to the way on which he is alreadybeing sent. It is to apprehend and accept the dominion of Beingalready holding sway, and so to be \"taken into a freeing claim\"(QT 26).

The truth of modern man\'s situation must become known tohim. This does not mean at all that man can be presented withsome \"truth\" that, if it were once brought to his attention, hemight then grasp, assent to, and act upon. For Heidegger such\"truth,\" the corresponding of a statement with a situation, wouldbe mere correctness. Truth is unconcealment. That is not to saythat it is something immediately accessible. Unconcealment issimultaneously concealment. Unconcealment, truth, is nevernakedly present to be immediately known. The truth of modernman\'s situation is a revealing that comes upon him, but it comesupon him veiled.

Enframing is a mode of revealing, a destining of Being. Yetprecisely under its dominion nothing whatever, including manhimself, appears as it intrinsically is; the truth of its Being re-mains concealed. Everything exists and appears as though itwere of man\'s making.

Because Enframing, as a revealing of Being, rules in this way,it is a danger beyond any danger that man otherwise knows. Theessence of Enframing, its manner of coming to presence, \"is thatsetting-upon gathered into itself which entraps the truth of itsown coming to presence with oblivion. This entrapping disguisesitself, in that it develops into the setting in order of everythingthat presences as standing-reserve, establishes itself in thestanding-reserve, and rules as the standing-reserve\" (T 37-38).In this \"oblivion\" that blocks the self-manifesting of Being, man\'sdanger lies. The danger is real that every other way of revealingwill be driven out and that man will lose his true relation tohimself and to all else. Language, the primal mode through whichman may experience and think and know whatever is, in itsBeing, may be bereft of its power, to become only a mere instru-ment of information. And man may be divested of his trueessence and become one who \"manufactures himself\" (Sem. 34;cf. QT 26 ff.). Man himself, through whom the ordering char-acteristic of Enframing takes place, may even be wholly suckedup into the standing-reserve and may come to exist not as the

Introduction xxxv

\"openness-for-Being\" (\"Da-sem\"), but as a merely self-consciousbeing knowing himself only as an instrument ready for use.2

Yet this stark eventuality need not befall man. For Enframingnecessarily and intrinsically rules not merely as danger but alsoas that which saves. These are not two discrete aspects of itsholding sway. The danger \"is the saving power\" (T 42). En-framing is a revealing. It manifests first of all the withdrawnnessof Being. It estranges man from Being. Yet it remains a revealing.In it Being is still confronting man. Therefore Enframing bearswithin itself simultaneously with its endangering of man thatother possibility, that man will be delivered from his estrange-ment and that it will be granted to him to come into an essentialrelationship with Being, recollectingly to receive what is presentto him in all that is and thoughtfully to guard it (QT 32 ff.).

In this twofoldness of Enframing as danger and saving power,and not in any merely human effort, lies the possibility thattechnology may be overcome. This does not mean that technologywill be done away with. It means, rather, that technology will besurmounted from within itself, in such a way as to be restoredto and fulfilled in its own essence. The unconcealment, the truth,concealed in the rule of technology will flash forth in that veryconcealing. Being will reveal itself in the very ongoing of tech-nology, precisely in that flashing. But not without man. For manis needed for this as for every revealing of Being. Man must cometo that place where, through language, through thinking, thisrevealing may come to pass. Yet man cannot bring it about, andhe cannot know when it will take place (T 39, 41-42).

What comes to pass happens suddenly. Heidegger speaks ofit as a \"turning.\" It is a turning within Enframing, within theessence of technology as the danger. It is the entrapping of thetruth of Being in oblivion, i.e., in concealment. The truth, theunconcealment, of Being, is, in the very instant of its revealing,

2\. In a letter to Professor J. Glenn Gray (October 10, 1972) concerningthis work, Heidegger states: \"Everything that I have attempted is misunder-stood without the turning from \'consciousness\' into the \' openness-for-Bcing\'that was being prepared in Being and Time.\" (\"Ohne die in Sein und Zeitsich anbahnende Wendung vom \'Bewusstsein\' in das \'Da-sc/V wird alles,was ich versuchte, missverstanden.\") Heidegger has emphatically expressedhis preference for \"openness\" and his disapprobation of \"there\" as a trans-lation of da in Dasein.

xxxvi Introduction

caught up in concealing. Yet the revealing of the truth of Beingis concealed as revealing. Hence, \"when this entrapping-with-oblivion does come expressly to pass, then oblivion as such turnsin and abides\"; that is, concealment is revealed as concealment(T 43)---for it conceals that which is itself simultaneously shownas being concealed.

Here Enframing, a destining of Being that denies to everythingits Being, becomes simultaneously that which saves, that whichbestows Being. For in it the truth of Being, Being\'s own uncon-cealment, turns about and enters into whatever is (cf. T 41).

In this \"turning,\" Being reveals itself solely from out of itself;yet it necessarily does so in such a way as to reach man. Forwithout man, Being cannot come freely into the open, as theBeing of what is. This turning about of concealing and unconceal-ing, which so closely involves Being and man, is a granted gift.

The sudden flashing of the truth of Being into once truthlessBeing, which comes to pass in the essence of technology, in En-framing, is an \"entering flashing look,\" is \"insight into thatwhich is\"---i.e., into Being itself (T 46). This is no humanlooking, no human seeing. Quite to the contrary, it is Being\'sdisclosing of itself. In it men are the ones beheld in their essence,so that they behold (cf. T 47). Heidegger uses for that in-flashingwhich is the self-revealing turning within Being itself the wordEreignis. It is a disclosing bringing to pass, a \"bringing to sightthat brings into its own\" (T 45, 38 n. 4). Taking place withinBeing, it returns Being to itself---here, restoring the essence oftechnology to itself as a revealing---and it simultaneously bringsman, glimpsed in his essence, to glimpse the revealing givenappropriately to him.

This disclosing brings itself to pass always uniquely. Beingand man belong together. The disclosing here named is the ful-filling of that relation. It brings man and Being into their own inentrusting them to one another. It is a \"letting belong together\"of man and Being (Pr. Iden. 39).

Enframing and the \"disclosing that brings into its own\" are intruth one. Heidegger can speak of Enframing as the \"photo-graphic negative\" of that disclosing (Sem. 42). In enframing,Being and man confront each other, but they meet in estrange-ment. In the unique disclosing that brings them into their own,

Introduction xxxvii

they meet in the very same relationship; but now, instead of andyet within the skeletal darkness of Enframing, there flashes alsothe light of that disclosing which brings them to belong together,which grants them what is truly their own.

Here there can be disclosed to modern man something beyondwhat was known to the Greeks. The Greeks knew the together-ness of man and Being. But now, in our age, it can be possible to\"glimpse a first oppressing flash\" of the disclosing bringing-to-pass that brings man and Being into a constellation that is newand newly known (Pr. Iden. 38). In Enframing, precisely in itscharacter as \"the mutual challenge of man and Being to enterupon the calculating of the calculable,\" that newness of relation-ship appears (Pr. Iden. 40). When we catch sight of the turningin the essence of Enframing, we do not simply catch sight of thebelonging together of man and Being. We do more: \"We witnessa belonging together of man and Being in which the letting be-long first determines the manner of the \'together\' and its unity\"(Pr. Iden. 38, second italics mine). Within and beyond the loom-ing presence of modern technology there dawns the possibilityof a fuller relationship between man and Being---and hencebetween man and all that is---than there has ever been.

In looking upon the present, our thinking can hope to see,over and beyond the immediate, evident situation of man, therelation of Being and man \"from out of that which gives themto belong to one another, from out of the disclosing bringing-to-pass that brings them into their own\" (Pr. Iden. 40). Suchthinking is completely different from the sort of instantaneouscalculating on which we more and more rely. It is a thinkingwithin the sphere of tradition, a learning through what has beenthought. As such, it is freed by tradition from being a merethinking back, to become a thinking forward that is totally re-moved from planning, ordering, and setting up for use.

It has sometimes been said that Heidegger exhibits in his philo-sophical work extreme arrogance. True, he does not, like Des-cartes, put forth his thinking as possessed of the compellingcertainty of self-evident truth; nor does he, like Hegel, believehimself capable of surveying and expressing the truth about allhuman history and all reality. But does he not consider himself

xxxviii Introduction

to have insight into reality such as none before him has ever had?It is a fact that his thinking is confined to Western history andWestern thought. But within that scope does he not, as in histreatment of Nietzsche, believe himself able on the basis of thatinsight to think that which is \"unthought\" in the thought ofothers, to discover the true meaning that those before him couldnot themselves see? He does. Yet is this arrogance, or is thereinsight here?

Surely Heidegger himself would say that whatever insight hehas is not of his own discovering but comes to him from out ofreality itself. Clearly he continually feels himself summoned torespond to the revealing that comes to him and to call others tothe same path. Deeply conscious as he is of his place within atradition, Heidegger doubtless regards what seems to some likethe proud reinterpreting of others\' work as being, rather, thediscovery in that work of far more meaning than those beforehim who accomplished it were given to see. Certainly, althoughHeidegger speaks with assurance of his insight, and though itranges far, he also holds it to be but a glimpse, a beginning, anentering of modern man upon a thinking that, in its own time,may be granted to see far more clearly and to see anew (cf. WN55-56). In his philosophical work he has moved forward and everforward, not bound by any given formulation of his thought. ToHeidegger true thinking always remains a revealing, and he mustfollow where that revealing leads. The openness of his thinkingshows itself fittingly enough in the fact that each of the essaysin this volume ends, not with a declarative statement of what isincontrovertibly true, but with actual questions or with a pointingto some way or reality needed beyond what is now known. Eachessay, whole though it be in itself, remains a part of an un-finished way. Where Descartes built glass palaces inviolable andHegel a mansion finished for all time, Heidegger builds, as itwere, sandcastles, ready to be reshaped or swept away in thenext responsive on-working of thought.

Heidegger has written:

At the close of a lecture called \'The Question Concerning Tech-nology/\' given some time ago, I said: \"Questioning is the piety ofthinking/\' \"Piety\" is meant here in the ancient sense: obedient, or

Introduction xxxix

submissive, and in this case submitting to what thinking has tothink about. One of the exciting experiences of thinking is that attimes it does not fully comprehend the new insights it has justgained, and does not properly see them through. Such, too, is thecase with the sentence just cited that questioning is the piety ofthinking. The lecture ending with that sentence was already in theambience of the realization that the true stance of thinking cannotbe to put questions, but must be to listen to that which our ques-tioning vouchsafes---and all questioning begins to be a questioningonly in virtue of pursuing its quest for essential Being.3

This is Heidegger\'s own way and his quest. This is the intrigu-ing adventure to which he summons us in the essays that follow.Has he glimpsed truth that might lighten our stricken age? Tojudge of that we must pursue with him the paths of his ownthinking.

In what follows we shall be questioning concerning technology.Questioning builds a way. We would be advised, therefore, aboveall to pay heed to the way, and not to fix our attention on iso-lated sentences and topics. The way is a way of thinking. Allways of thinking, more or less perceptibly, lead through languagein a manner that is extraordinary. We shall be questioning con-cerning technology, and in so doing we should like to preparea free relationship to it. The relationship will be free if it opensour human existence to the essence of technology.1 When we

1\. \"Essence\" is the traditional translation of the German noun Wesen.One of Heidegger\'s principal aims in this essay is to seek the true meaningof essence through or by way of the \"correct\" meaning. He will later showthat Wesen does not simply mean what something is, but that it means,further, the way in which something pursues its course, the way in whichit remains through time as what it is. Heidegger writes elsewhere that thenoun Wesen does not mean quidditas originally, but rather \"enduring aspresence\" (das Wahren als Gegenwart). (See An Introduction to Meta-physics, trans. Ralph Manheim \[New York: Doubleday, 1961\], p. 59.) Wesenas a noun derives from the verb wesen, which is seldom used as such inmodern German. The verb survives primarily in inflected forms of the verbsein (to be) and in such words as the adjective anwesend (present). Theold verbal forms from which wesen stems meant to tarry or dwell. Heideg-ger repeatedly identifies wesen as \"the same as wahren \[to last or endure\].\"(See p. 30 below and SR 161.) As a verb, wesen wi\\\\ usually be translated

can respond to this essence, we shall be able to experience thetechnological within its own bounds.

Technology is not equivalent to the essence of technology.When we are seeking the essence of \"tree,\" we have to becomeaware that That which pervades every tree, as tree, is not itselfa tree that can be encountered among all the other trees.

Likewise, the essence of technology is by no means any-thing technological. Thus we shall never experience our relation-ship to the essence of technology so long as we merely conceiveand push forward the technological, put up with it, or evade it.Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology,whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we are deliveredover to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as some-thing neutral; for this conception of it,2 to which today we par-ticularly like to do homage, makes us utterly blind to the essenceof technology.

According to ancient doctrine, the essence of a thing is con-sidered to be what the thing is. We ask the question concerningtechnology when we ask what it is. Everyone knows the twostatements that answer our question. One says: Technology is ameans to an end. The other says: Technology is a human activity.The two definitions of technology belong together. For to positends and procure and utilize the means to them is a humanactivity. The manufacture and utilization of equipment, tools,and machines, the manufactured and used things themselves,and the needs and ends that they serve, all belong to what tech-

here with \"to come to presence,\" a rendering wherein the meaning \"endure\"should be strongly heard. Occasionally it will be translated \"to essence,\"and its gerund will be rendered with \"essencing.\" The noun Wesen willregularly be translated \"essence\" until Heidegger\'s explanatory discussionis reached. Thereafter, in this and the succeeding essays, it will often betranslated with \"coming to presence.\" In relation to all these renderings, thereader should bear in mind a point that is of fundamental importance toHeidegger, namely, that the root of wesen, with its meaning \"to dwell,\"provides one integral component in the meaning of the verb sein (to be).(Cf. An Introduction to Metaphysics, p. 59.)

2\. \"Conception\" here translates the noun Vorstellung. Elsewhere in thisvolume, Vorstellung will usually be translated by \"representation,\" and itsrelated verb vorstellen by \"to represent.\" Both \"conception\" and \"repre-sentation\" should suggest a placing or setting-up-before. Cf. the discussionof Vorstellung in AWP 131-132.

nology is. The whole complex of these contrivances is tech-nology. Technology itself is a contrivance, or, in Latin, aninstrumentum.9

The current conception of technology, according to which it isa means and a human activity, can therefore be called the in-strumental and anthropological definition of technology.

Who would ever deny that it is correct? It is in obvious con-formity with what we are envisioning when we talk about tech-nology. The instrumental definition of technology is indeed souncannily correct that it even holds for modern technology, ofwhich, in other respects, we maintain with some justificationthat it is, in contrast to the older handwork technology, some-thing completely different and therefore new. Even the powerplant with its turbines and generators is a man-made means toan end established by man. Even the jet aircraft and the high-frequency apparatus are means to ends. A radar station is ofcourse less simple than a weather vane. To be sure, the construc-tion of a high-frequency apparatus requires the interlocking ofvarious processes of technical-industrial production. And cer-tainly a sawmill in a secluded valley of the Black Forest is aprimitive means compared with the hydroelectric plant in theRhine River.

But this much remains correct: modern technology too is ameans to an end. That is why the instrumental conception oftechnology conditions every attempt to bring man into the rightrelation to technology. Everything depends on our manipulatingtechnology in the proper manner as a means. We will, as we say,\"get\" technology \"spiritually in hand.\" We will master it. Thewill to mastery becomes all the more urgent the more technologythreatens to slip from human control.

But suppose now that technology were no mere means, howwould it stand with the will to master it? Yet we said, did we

3\. Instrumentum signifies that which functions to heap or build up or toarrange. Heidegger here equates it with the noun Einrichtung, translated\"contrivance,\" which can also mean arrangement, adjustment, furnishing, orequipment. In accordance with his dictum that the true must be sought byway of the correct, Heidegger here anticipates with his identification oftechnology as an instrumentum and an Einrichtung his later \"true\" charac-terization of technology in terms of setting-in-place, ordering, Enframing,and standing-reserve.

not, that the instrumental definition of technology is correct?To be sure. The correct always fixes upon something pertinentin whatever is under consideration. However, in order to be cor-rect, this fixing by no means needs to uncover the thing inquestion in its essence. Only at the point where such an uncov-ering happens does the true come to pass.4 For that reason themerely correct is not yet the true. Only the true brings us intoa free relationship with that which concerns us from out of itsessence. Accordingly, the correct instrumental definition of tech-nology still does not show us technology\'s essence. In order thatwe may arrive at this, or at least come close to it, we must seekthe true by way of the correct. We must ask: What is the instru-mental itself? Within what do such things as means and endbelong? A means is that whereby something is effected and thusattained. Whatever has an effect as its consequence is called acause. But not only that by means of which something else iseffected is a cause. The end in keeping with which the kind ofmeans to be used is determined is also considered a cause.Wherever ends are pursued and means are employed, whereverinstrumentality reigns, there reigns causality.

For centuries philosophy has taught that there are four causes:(1) the causa materialis, the material, the matter out of which,for example, a silver chalice is made; (2) the causa formalis, theform, the shape into which the material enters; (3) the causafinalis, the end, for example, the sacrificial rite in relation towhich the chalice required is determined as to its form and mat-ter; (4) the causa efficiens, which brings about the effect that isthe finished, actual chalice, in this instance, the silversmith. Whattechnology is, when represented as a means, discloses itself whenwe trace instrumentality back to fourfold causality.

But suppose that causality, for its part, is veiled in darknesswith respect to what it is? Certainly for centuries we have actedas though the doctrine of the four causes had fallen from heavenas a truth as clear as daylight. But it might be that the time hascome to ask, Why are there just four causes? In relation to theaforementioned four, what does \"cause\" really mean? From

4\. \"Come to pass\" translates sich ereignet. For a discussion of the fullermeaning of the verb ereignen, see T 38 n. 4, 45.

whence does it come that the causal character of the four causesis so unifiedly determined that they belong together?

So long as we do not allow ourselves to go into these ques-tions, causality, and with it instrumentality, and with the latterthe accepted definition of technology, remain obscure andgroundless.

For a long time we have been accustomed to representing causeas that which brings something about. In this connection, tobring about means to obtain results, effects. The causa efficiens,but one among the four causes, sets the standard for all causality.This goes so far that we no longer even count the causa finalis,telic finality, as causality. Causa, casus, belongs to the verbcadere, \"to fall/\' and means that which brings it about that some-thing falls out as a result in such and such a way. The doctrineof the four causes goes back to Aristotle. But everything thatlater ages seek in Greek thought under the conception and rubric\"causality/7 in the realm of Greek thought and for Greek thoughtper se has simply nothing at all to do with bringing about andeffecting. What we call cause \[Ursache\] and the Romans callcausa is called aition by the Greeks, that to which somethingelse is indebted \[das, was ein anderes verschuldet\].5 The fourcauses are the ways, all belonging at once to each other, of beingresponsible for something else. An example can clarify this.

Silver is that out of which the silver chalice is made. As thismatter (hyle), it is co-responsible for the chalice. The chalice isindebted to, i.e., owes thanks to, the silver for that out of whichit consists. But the sacrificial vessel is indebted not only to thesilver. As a chalice, that which is indebted to the silver appearsin the aspect of a chalice and not in that of a brooch or a ring.Thus the sacrificial vessel is at the same time indebted to theaspect (eidos) of chaliceness. Both the silver into which theaspect is admitted as chalice and the aspect in which the silverappears are in their respective ways co-responsible for thesacrificial vessel.

5\. Das, was ein anderes verschuldet is a quite idomatic expression thathere would mean to many German readers \"that which is the cause ofsomething else.\" The verb verschulden actually has a wide range of mean-ings---to be indebted, to owe, to be guilty, to be responsible for or to, tocause. Heidegger intends to awaken all these meanings and to have conno-tations of mutual interdependence sound throughout this passage.

But there remains yet a third that is above all responsible forthe sacrificial vessel. It is that which in advance confines thechalice within the realm of consecration and bestowal.6 Throughthis the chalice is circumscribed as sacrificial vessel. Circum-scribing gives bounds to the thing. With the bounds the thingdoes not stop; rather from out of them it begins to be what,after production, it will be. That which gives bounds, that whichcompletes, in this sense is called in Greek telos, which is all toooften translated as \"aim\" or \"purpose,\" and so misinterpreted.The telos is responsible for what as matter and for what as aspectare together co-responsible for the sacrificial vessel.

Finally there is a fourth participant in the responsibility forthe finished sacrificial vessel\'s lying before us ready for use, i.e.,the silversmith---but not at all because he, in working, bringsabout the finished sacrificial chalice as if it were the effect of amaking; the silversmith is not a causa efficiens.

The Aristotelian doctrine neither knows the cause that isnamed by this term nor uses a Greek word that would corre-spond to it.

The silversmith considers carefully and gathers together thethree aforementioned ways of being responsible and indebted.To consider carefully \[iiberlegen\] is in Greek legein, logos.Legein is rooted in apophainesthai, to bring forward into ap-pearance. The silversmith is co-responsible as that from whencethe sacrificial vessel\'s bringing forth and resting-in-self take andretain their first departure. The three previously mentioned waysof being responsible owe thanks to the pondering of the silver-smith for the \"that\" and the \"how\" of their coming into appear-ance and into play for the production of the sacrificial vessel.

Thus four ways of being responsible hold sway in the sacrificialvessel that lies ready before us. They differ from one another,yet they belong together. What unites them from the beginning?In what does this playing in unison of the four ways of being

6\. Literally, \"confines into\"---the German preposition in with the accusa-tive. Heidegger often uses this construction in ways that are unusual inGerman, as they would be in English. It will ordinarily be translated hereby \"within\" so as to distinguish it from \"in\" used to translate in with thedative.

responsible play? What is the source of the unity of the fourcauses? What, after all, does this owing and being responsiblemean, thought as the Greeks thought it?

Today we are too easily inclined either to understand beingresponsible and being indebted moralistically as a lapse, or elseto construe them in terms of effecting. In either case we bar toourselves the way to the primal meaning of that which is latercalled causality. So long as this way is not opened up to us weshall also fail to see what instrumentality, which is based oncausality, actually is.

In order to guard against such misinterpretations of beingresponsible and being indebted, let us clarify the four ways ofbeing responsible in terms of that for which they are respon-sible. According to our example, they are responsible for thesilver chalice\'s lying ready before us as a sacrificial vessel. Lyingbefore and lying ready (hypokeisthai) characterize the presencingof something that presences. The four ways of being responsiblebring something into appearance. They let it come forth intopresencing \[An-wesen\].7 They set it free to that place and sostart it on its way, namely, into its complete arrival. The prin-cipal characteristic of being responsible is this starting somethingon its way into arrival. It is in the sense of such a starting some-thing on its way into arrival that being responsible is an occa-sioning or an inducing to go forward \[Ver-an-las&n\].8 On the

7\. By writing An-wesen, Heidegger stresses the composition of the verbanwesen, translated as \"to presence.\" The verb consists of wesen (literally,to continue or endure) with the prepositional prefix an- (at, to, toward).It is man who must receive presencing, man to whom it comes as enduring.Cf. On Time and Being, trans. Joan Stambaugh (New York: Harper & Row,1972), p. 12.

8\. Ver-an-lassen is Heidegger\'s writing of the verb veranlassen in nounform, now hyphenated to bring out its meaning. Veranlassen ordinarilymeans to occasion, to cause, to bring about, to call forth. Its use here re-lates back to the use of anlassen (to leave \[something\] on, to let loose, toset going), here translated \"to start something on its way.\" Anlassen hasjust been similarly written as an-lassen so as to emphasize its compositionfrom lassen (to let or leave) and an (to or toward). One of the functions ofthe German prefix ver- is to intensify the force of a verb. Andre Preauquotes Heidegger as saying: \"Ver-an-lassen is more active than an-lassen.The ver-, as it were, pushes the latter toward a doing \[vers un faire\].\" Cf.Martin Heidegger, Essais et Conferences (Paris: Gallimard, 1958), p. 16 n.

basis of a look at what the Greeks experienced in being re-sponsible, in aitia, we now give this verb \"to occasion\" a moreinclusive meaning, so that it now is the name for the essence ofcausality thought as the Greeks thought it. The common andnarrower meaning of \"occasion\" in contrast is nothing morethan striking against and releasing, and means a kind of second-ary cause within the whole of causality.

But in what, then, does the playing in unison of the four waysof occasioning play? They let what is not yet present arrive intopresencing. Accordingly, they are unifiedly ruled over by abringing that brings what presences into appearance. Plato tellsus what this bringing is in a sentence from the Symposium(205b): he gar toi ek tou me onton eis to on ionti hotoioun aitiapasa esti poiesis. \"Every occasion for whatever passes over andgoes forward into presencing from that which is not presencingis poiesis, is bringing-forth \[Her-vor-bringen\].\"9

It is of utmost importance that we think bringing-forth in itsfull scope and at the same time in the sense in which the Greeksthought it. Not only handcraft manufacture, not only artisticand poetical bringing into appearance and concrete imagery, isa bringing-forth, poiesis. Physis also, the arising of somethingfrom out of itself, is a bringing-forth, poiesis. Physis is indeedpoiesis in the highest sense. For what presences by means ofphysis has the bursting open belonging to bringing-forth, e.g.,the bursting of a blossom into bloom, in itself (en heautoi). Incontrast, what is brought forth by the artisan or the artist, e.g.,

9\. The full gamut of meaning for the verb hervorbringen, here function-ing as a noun, includes to bring forth or produce, to generate or beget, toutter, to elicit. Heidegger intends that all of these nuances be heard. Hehyphenates the word in order to emphasize its adverbial prefixes, her-(here or hither) and vor- (forward or forth). Heidegger elsewhere makesspecific the meaning resident in Her-vor-bringen for him by utilizing thoseprefixes independently. Thus he says (translating literally), \"Bringing-forth-hither brings hither out of concealment, forth into unconcealment\" (cf. be-low, p. 11); and---after identifying working (wirken) and her-vor-bringen---he says that working must be understood as \"bringing hither---into uncon-cealment, forth---into presencing\" (SR 161). Because of the awkwardnessof the English phrase \"to bring forth hither,\" it has not been possible toinclude in the translation of her-vor-bringen the nuance of meaning thather- provides.

the silver chalice, has the bursting open belonging to bringing-forth not in itself, but in another (en alldi), in the craftsman orartist.

The modes of occasioning, the four causes, are at play, then,within bringing-forth. Through bringing-forth, the growingthings of nature as well as whatever is completed through thecrafts and the arts come at any given time to their appearance.

But how does bringing-forth happen, be it in nature or inhandwork and art? What is the bringing-forth in which thefourfold way of occasioning plays? Occasioning has to do withthe presencing \[Anwesen\] of that which at any given time comesto appearance in bringing-forth. Bringing-forth brings hither outof concealment forth into unconcealment. Bringing-forth comesto pass only insofar as something concealed comes into uncon-cealment. This coming rests and moves freely within what wecall revealing \[das Entbergen\].10 The Greeks have the word

10\. The verb entbergen (to reveal) and the allied noun Entbergung (re-vealing) are unique to Heidegger. Because of the exigencies of translation;entbergen must usually be translated with \"revealing,\" and the presence ofEntbergung, which is rather infrequently used, has therefore regrettablybeen obscured for want of an appropriate English noun as alternative thatwould be sufficiently active in meaning. Entbergen and Entbergung areformed from the verb bergen and the verbal prefix ent-. Bergen means torescue, to recover, to secure, to harbor, to conceal. Ent- is used in Germanverbs to connote in one way or another a change from an existing situa-tion. It can mean \"forth\" or \"out\" or can connote a change that is thenegating of a former condition. Entbergen connotes an opening out fromprotective concealing, a harboring forth. For a presentation of Heidegger\'scentral tenet that it is only as protected and preserved---and that means asenclosed and secure---that anything is set free to endure, to continue asthat which it is, i.e., to be, see \"Building Dwelling Thinking\" in Poetry,Language, Thought, trans. Albert Hofstadter (New York: Harper & Row,1971), p. 149, and cf. p. 25 below.

Entbergen and Entbergung join a family of words all formed from bergen---verbergen (to conceal), Verborgenheit (concealment), das Verborgene (theconcealed), Unverborgenheit (unconcealment), das Unverborgene (the un-concealed)---of which Heidegger makes frequent use. The lack of viableEnglish words sufficiently numerous to permit a similar use of but onefundamental stem has made it necessary to obscure, through the use of\"reveal,\" the close relationship among ail the words just mentioned. Noneof the English words used---\"reveal,\" \"conceal,\" \"unconceal\"---evinces withany adequacy the meaning resident in bergen itself; yet the reader shouldbe constantly aware that the full range of connotation present in bergensounds for Heidegger within all these, its derivatives.

aletheia for revealing. The Romans translate this with Veritas.We say \"truth\" and usually understand it as the correctness ofan idea.

But where have we strayed to? We are questioning concerningtechnology, and we have arrived now at aletheia, at revealing.What has the essence of technology to do with revealing? Theanswer: everything. For every bringing-forth is grounded inrevealing. Bringing-forth, indeed, gathers within itself the fourmodes of occasioning---causality---and rules them throughout.Within its domain belong end and means, belongs instru-mentality.11 Instrumentality is considered to be the fundamentalcharacteristic of technology. If we inquire, step by step, intowhat technology, represented as means, actually is, then we shallarrive at revealing. The possibility of all productive manufactur-ing lies in revealing.

Technology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a wayof revealing. If we give heed to this, then another whole realmfor the essence of technology will open itself up to us. It is therealm of revealing, i.e., of truth.12

This prospect strikes us as strange. Indeed, it should do so,should do so as persistently as possible and with so much urgencythat we will finally take seriously the simple question of what thename \"technology\" means. The word stems from the Greek.Technikon means that which belongs to techne. We must observe

11\. Here and elsewhere \"belongs within\" translates the German gehort inwith the accusative (literally, belongs into), an unusual usage that Heideggeroften employs. The regular German construction is gehort zu (belongs to).With the use of \"belongs into/\' Heidegger intends to suggest a relationshipinvolving origin.

12\. Heidegger here hyphenates the word Wahrheit (truth) so as to exposeits stem, wahr. He points out elsewhere that words with this stem have acommon derivation and underlying meaning (SR 165). Such words oftenshow the connotations of attentive watchfulness and guarding that he therefinds in their Greek cognates, horao, ora, e.g., wahren (to watch over andkeep safe) and bewahren (to preserve). Hyphenating Wahrheit draws itovertly into this circle of meaning. It points to the fact that in truth, whichis unconcealment (Unverborgenheit), a safekeeping carries itself out.Wahrheit thus offers here a very close parallel to its companion nounEntbergung (revealing; literally, harboring forth), built on bergen (torescue, to harbor, to conceal). See n. 10, above. For a further discussion ofwords built around wahr, see T 42, n. 9.

two things with respect to the meaning of this word. One is thattechne is the name not only for the activities and skills of thecraftsman, but also for the arts of the mind and the fine arts.Techne belongs to bringing-forth, to poiesis; it is somethingpoietic.

The other point that we should observe with regard to techneis even more important. From earliest times until Plato the wordtechne is linked with the word episteme. Both words are namesfor knowing in the widest sense. They mean to be entirely athome in something, to understand and be expert in it. Suchknowing provides an opening up. As an opening up it is a re-vealing. Aristotle, in a discussion of special importance (Nico-machean Ethics, Bk. VI, chaps. 3 and 4), distinguishes betweenepisteme and techne and indeed with respect to what and howthey reveal. Techne is a mode of aletheuein. It reveals whateverdoes not bring itself forth and does not yet lie here before us,whatever can look and turn out now one way and now another.Whoever builds a house or a ship or forges a sacrificial chalicereveals what is to be brought forth, according to the perspectivesof the four modes of occasioning. This revealing gathers togetherin advance the aspect and the matter of ship or house, with aview to the finished thing envisioned as completed, and fromthis gathering determines the manner of its construction. Thuswhat is decisive in techne does not lie at all in making andmanipulating nor in the using of means, but rather in the afore-mentioned revealing. It is as revealing, and not as manufactur-ing, that techne is a bringing-forth.

Thus the clue to what the word techne means and to how theGreeks defined it leads us into the same context that openeditself to us when we pursued the question of what instrumental-ity as such in truth might be.

Technology is a mode of revealing. Technology comes topresence \[Wesf\] in the realm where revealing and unconcealmenttake place, where aletheia, truth, happens.

In opposition to this definition of the essential domain oftechnology, one can object that it indeed holds for Greekthought and that at best it might apply to the techniques ofthe handcraftsman, but that it simply does not fit modernmachine-powered technology. And it is precisely the latter and

it alone that is the disturbing thing, that moves us to ask thequestion concerning technology per se. It is said that moderntechnology is something incomparably different from all earliertechnologies because it is based on modern physics as an exactscience. Meanwhile we have come to understand more clearlythat the reverse holds true as well: Modern physics, as experi-mental, is dependent upon technical apparatus and upon prog-ress in the building of apparatus. The establishing of thismutual relationship between technology and physics is correct.But it remains a merely historiographical establishing of factsand says nothing about that in which this mutual relationshipis grounded. The decisive question still remains: Of what es-sence is modern technology that it happens to think of puttingexact science to use?

What is modern technology? It too is a revealing. Only whenwe allow our attention to rest on this fundamental characteristicdoes that which is new in modern technology show itself to us.

And yet the revealing that holds sway throughout moderntechnology does not unfold into a bringing-forth in the sense ofpoiesis. The revealing that rules in modern technology is a chal-lenging \[Herausfordern\],13 which puts to nature the unreasonabledemand that it supply energy that can be extracted and storedas such. But does this not hold true for the old windmill as well?No. Its sails do indeed turn in the wind; they are left entirely tothe wind\'s blowing. But the windmill does not unlock energyfrom the air currents in order to store it.

In contrast, a tract of land is challenged into the putting out ofcoal and ore. The earth now reveals itself as a coal mining dis-trict, the soil as a mineral deposit. The field that the peasantformerly cultivated and set in order \[bestelite\] appears differentlythan it did when to set in order still meant to take care of and

13\. Herausfordern means to challenge, to call forth or summon to action,to demand positively, to provoke. It is composed of the verb fordern (todemand, to summon, to challenge) and the adverbial prefixes her- (hither)and aus- (out). The verb might be rendered very literally as \"to demandout hither.\" The structural similarity between herausfordern and her-vor-bringen (to bring forth hither) is readily apparent. It serves of itself topoint up the relation subsisting between the two modes of revealing ofv\\hich the verbs speak---modes that, in the very distinctive ways peculiar tothem, occasion a coming forth into unconcealment and presencing. Seebelow, 29-30.

to maintain. The work of the peasant does not challenge thesoil of the field. In the sowing of the grain it places the seed inthe keeping of the forces of growth and watches over its increase.But meanwhile even the cultivation of the field has come underthe grip of another kind of setting-in-order, which sets upon\[stellt\] nature.14 It sets upon it in the sense of challenging it.Agriculture is now the mechanized food industry. Air is now setupon to yield nitrogen, the earth to yield ore, ore to yielduranium, for example; uranium is set upon to yield atomicenergy, which can be released either for destruction or for peace-ful use.

This setting-upon that challenges forth the energies of natureis an expediting \[Fordern\], and in two ways. It expedites in thatit unlocks and exposes. Yet that expediting is always itselfdirected from the beginning toward furthering something else,i.e., toward driving on to the maximum yield at the minimumexpense. The coal that has been hauled out in some miningdistrict has not been supplied in order that it may simply bepresent somewhere or other. It is stockpiled; that is, it is on call,ready to deliver the sun\'s warmth that is stored in it. The sun\'swarmth is challenged forth for heat, which in turn is ordered todeliver steam whose pressure turns the wheels that keep afactory running.

14\. The verb stellen (to place or set) has a wide variety of uses. It canmean to put in place, to order, to arrange, to furnish or supply, and, in amilitary context, to challenge or engage. Here Heidegger sees the connota-tions of herausfordern (to challenge, to call forth, to demand out hither) asfundamentally determinative of the meaning of stellen, and this remainstrue throughout his ensuing discussion. The translation of stellen with \"toset upon\" is intended to carry this meaning. The connotations of setting inplace and of supplying that lie within the word stellen remain stronglvpresent in Heidegger\'s repeated use of the verb hereafter, however, sincethe \"setting-upon\" of which it speaks is inherently a setting in place so asto supply. Where these latter meanings come decisively to the fore, stellenhas been translated with \"to set\" or \"to set up,\" or, rarely, with \"to supply.\"

Stellen embraces the meanings of a whole family of verbs: bestellen (toorder, command; to set in order), vorstellen (to represent), sicherstellen (tosecure), nachstellen (to entrap), verstellen (to block or disguise), herstellen(to produce, to set here), darstellen (to present or exhibit), and so on. Inthese verbs the various nuances within stellen are reinforced and madespecific. All these meanings are gathered together in Heidegger\'s uniqueuse of the word that is pivotal for him, Ge-stell (Enframing). Cf. pp. 19 ff.See also the opening paragraph of \"The Turning,\" pp. 36-37.

The hydroelectric plant is set into the current of the Rhine. Itsets the Rhine to supplying its hydraulic pressure, which thensets the turbines turning. This turning sets those machines inmotion whose thrust sets going the electric current for whichthe long-distance power station and its network of cables areset up to dispatch electricity.15 In the context of the interlockingprocesses pertaining to the orderly disposition of electricalenergy, even the Rhine itself appears as something at our com-mand. The hydroelectric plant is not built into the Rhine Riveras was the old wooden bridge that joined bank with bank forhundreds of years. Rather the river is dammed up into the powerplant. What the river is now, namely, a water power supplier,derives from out of the essence of the power station. In orderthat we may even remotely consider the monstrousness thatreigns here, let us ponder for a moment the contrast that speaksout of the two titles, \'The Rhine\" as dammed up into thepower works, and \"The Rhine\" as uttered out of the art work,in Holderlin\'s hymn by that name. But, it will be replied, theRhine is still a river in the landscape, is it not? Perhaps. But how?In no other way than as an object on call for inspection by a tourgroup ordered there by the vacation industry.

The revealing that rules throughout modern technology hasthe character of a setting-upon, in the sense of a challenging-forth. That challenging happens in that the energy concealed innature is unlocked, what is unlocked is transformed, what istransformed is stored up, what is stored up is, in turn, distributed,and what is distributed is switched about ever anew. Unlocking,transforming, storing, distributing, and switching about are waysof revealing. But the revealing never simply comes to an end.Neither does it run off into the indeterminate. The revealingreveals to itself its own manifoldly interlocking paths, throughregulating their course. This regulating itself is, for its part,everywhere secured. Regulating and securing even become thechief characteristics of the challenging revealing.

15\. In these two sentences, in order to show something of the manner inwhich Heidegger gathers together a family of meanings, a series of stellenverbs---stellen (three times), herstellen, bestellen---have been translated withverbal expressions formed around \"set.\" For the usual meanings of theseverbs, see n. 14.

What kind of unconcealment is it, then, that is peculiar to thatwhich comes to stand forth through this setting-upon that chal-lenges? Everywhere everything is ordered to stand by, to beimmediately at hand, indeed to stand there just so that it maybe on call for a further ordering. Whatever is ordered about inthis way has its own standing. We call it the standing-reserve\[Bestand\].16 The word expresses here something more, and some-thing more essential, than mere \'\'stock/\' The name \"standing-reserve\" assumes the rank of an inclusive rubric. It designatesnothing less than the way in which everything presences that iswrought upon by the challenging revealing. Whatever stands byin the sense of standing-reserve no longer stands over againstus as object.

Yet an airliner that stands on the runway is surely an object.Certainly. We can represent the machine so. But then it concealsitself as to what and how it is. Revealed, it stands on the taxistrip only as standing-reserve, inasmuch as it is ordered to en-sure the possibility of transportation. For this it must be in itswhole structure and in every one of its constituent parts, on callfor duty, i.e., ready for takeoff. (Here it would be appropriateto discuss Hegel\'s definition of the machine as an autonomoustool. When applied to the tools of the craftsman, his characteri-zation is correct. Characterized in this way, however, the machineis not thought at all from out of the essence of technology withinwhich it belongs. Seen in terms of the standing-reserve, themachine is completely unautonomous, for it has its standingonly from the ordering of the orderable.)

The fact that now, wherever we try to point to modern tech-nology as the challenging revealing, the words \"setting-upon,\"\"ordering,\" \"standing-reserve,\" obtrude and accumulate in a dry,monotonous, and therefore oppressive way, has its basis in whatis now coming to utterance.

16\. Bestand ordinarily denotes a store or supply as \"standing by.\" Itcarries the connotation of the verb bestehen with its dual meaning of to lastand to undergo. Heidegger uses the word to characterize the manner inwhich everything commanded into place and ordered according to thechallenging demand ruling in modern technology presences as revealed. Hewishes to stress here not the permanency, but the orderability and substi-tutability of objects. Bestand contrasts with Gegenstand (object; that whichstands over against). Objects indeed lose their character as objects whenthey are caught up in the \"standing-reserve.\" Cf. Introduction, p. xxix.

Who accomplishes the challenging setting-upon through whichwhat we call the real is revealed as standing-reserve? Obviously,man. To what extent is man capable of such a revealing? Mancan indeed conceive, fashion, and carry through this or that inone way or another. But man does not have control over un-concealment itself, in which at any given time the real showsitself or withdraws. The fact that the real has been showingitself in the light of Ideas ever since the time of Plato, Plato didnot bring about. The thinker only responded to what addresseditself to him.

Only to the extent that man for his part is already challengedto exploit the energies of nature can this ordering revealinghappen. If man is challenged, ordered, to do this, then doesnot man himself belong even more originally than nature withinthe standing-reserve? The current talk about human resources,about the supply of patients for a clinic, gives evidence of this.The forester who, in the wood, measures the felled timber andto all appearances walks the same forest path in the same wayas did his grandfather is today commanded by profit-making inthe lumber industry, whether he knows it or not. He is madesubordinate to the orderability of cellulose, which for its partis challenged forth by the need for paper, which is then deliveredto newspapers and illustrated magazines. The latter, in theirturn, set public opinion to swallowing what is printed, so that aset configuration of opinion becomes available on demand. Yetprecisely because man is challenged more originally than are theenergies of nature, i.e., into the process of ordering, he never istransformed into mere standing-reserve. Since man drives tech-nology forward, he takes part in ordering as a way of revealing.But the unconcealment itself, within which ordering unfolds, isnever a human handiwork, any more than is the realm throughwhich man is already passing every time he as a subject relatesto an object.

Where and how does this revealing happen if it is no merehandiwork of man? We need not look far. We need only appre-hend in an unbiased way That which has already claimed manand has done so, so decisively that he can only be man at anygiven time as the one so claimed. Wherever man opens his eyesand ears, unlocks his heart, and gives himself over to meditating

and striving, shaping and working, entreating and thanking, hefinds himself everywhere already brought into the unconcealed.The unconcealment of the unconcealed has already come to passwhenever it calls man forth into the modes of revealing allottedto him. When man, in his way, from within unconcealmentreveals that which presences, he merely responds to the call ofunconcealment even when he contradicts it. Thus when man,investigating, observing, ensnares nature as an area of his ownconceiving, he has already been claimed by a way of revealingthat challenges him to approach nature as an object of research,until even the object disappears into the objectlessness ofstanding-reserve.

Modern technology as an ordering revealing is, then, no merelyhuman doing. Therefore we must take that challenging that setsupon man to order the real as standing-reserve in accordancewith the way in which it shows itself. That challenging gathersman into ordering. This gathering concentrates man upon or-dering the real as standing-reserve.

That which primordially unfolds the mountains into mountainranges and courses through them in their folded togetherness isthe gathering that we call \"Gebirg\" \[mountain chain\].

That original gathering from which unfold the ways in whichwe have feelings of one kind or another we name \"Gemiit\" \[dis-position\].

We now name that challenging claim which gathers manthither to order the self-revealing as standing-reserve: \"Ge-stell\"\[Enframing\].17

We dare to use this word in a sense that has been thoroughlyunfamiliar up to now.

17\. The translation \"Enframing\" for Ge-stell is intended to suggest,through the use of the prefix \"en-,\" something of the active meaning thatHeidegger here gives to the German word. While following the discussionthat now ensues, in which Enframing assumes a central role, the readershould be careful not to interpret the word as though it simply meant aframework of some sort. Instead he should constantly remember that En-framing is fundamentally a calling-forth. It is a \"challenging claim,\" ademanding summons, that \"gathers\" so as to reveal. This claim enframesin that it assembles and orders. It puts into a framework or configurationeverything that it summons forth, through an ordering for use that it isforever restructuring anew. Cf. Introduction, pp. xxix ff.

According to ordinary usage, the word Gestell \[frame\] meanssome kind of apparatus, e.g., a bookrack. Gestell is also the namefor a skeleton. And the employment of the word Gestell \[En-framing\] that is now required of us seems equally eerie, not tospeak of the arbitrariness with which words of a mature languageare thus misused. Can anything be more strange? Surely not.Yet this strangeness is an old usage of thinking. And indeedthinkers accord with this usage precisely at the point where it is amatter of thinking that which is highest. We, late born, are nolonger in a position to appreciate the significance of Plato\'s dar-ing to use the word eidos for that which in everything and ineach particular thing endures as present. For eidos, in the com-mon speech, meant the outward aspect \[Ansicht\] that a visiblething offers to the physical eye. Plato exacts of this word, how-ever, something utterly extraordinary: that it name what preciselyis not and never will be perceivable with physical eyes. But eventhis is by no means the full extent of what is extraordinary here.For idea names not only the nonsensuous aspect of what isphysically visible.18 Aspect (idea) names and is, also, that whichconstitutes the essence in the audible, the tasteable, the tactile,in everything that is in any way accessible. Compared with thedemands that Plato makes on language and thought in this andother instances, the use of the word Gestell as the name for theessence of modern technology, which we now venture here, isalmost harmless. Even so, the usage now required remains some-thing exacting and is open to misinterpretation.

Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-uponwhich sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal thereal, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframingmeans that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence ofmodern technology and which is itself nothing technological.On the other hand, all those things that are so familiar to us andare standard parts of an assembly, such as rods, pistons, andchassis, belong to the technological. The assembly itself, how-ever, together with the aforementioned stockparts, falls within

18\. Where idea is italicized it is not the English word but a transliterationof the Greek.

the sphere of technological activity; and this activity alwaysmerely responds to the challenge of Enframing, but it nevercomprises Enframing itself or brings it about.

The word stellen \[to set upon\] in the name Ge-stell \[Enfram-ing\] not only means challenging. At the same time it shouldpreserve the suggestion of another Stellen from which it stems,namely, that producing and presenting \[Her- und Dar-stellen\]which, in the sense of poiesis, lets what presences come forthinto unconcealment. This producing that brings forth---e.g., theerecting of a statue in the temple precinct---and the challengingordering now under consideration are indeed fundamentally dif-ferent, and yet they remain related in their essence. Both areways of revealing, of aletheia. In Enframing, that unconcealmentcomes to pass in conformity with which the work of moderntechnology reveals the real as standing-reserve. This work istherefore neither only a human activity nor a mere means withinsuch activity. The merely instrumental, merely anthropologicaldefinition of technology is therefore in principle untenable. Andit cannot be rounded out by being referred back to some meta-physical or religious explanation that undergirds it.

It remains true, nonetheless, that man in the technological ageis, in a particularly striking way, challenged forth into revealing.That revealing concerns nature, above all, as the chief storehouseof the standing energy reserve. Accordingly, man\'s orderingattitude and behavior display themselves first in the rise ofmodern physics as an exact science. Modern science\'s way ofrepresenting pursues and entraps nature as a calculable coher-ence of forces. Modern physics is not experimental physics be-cause it applies apparatus to the questioning of nature. Ratherthe reverse is true. Because physics, indeed already as puretheory, sets nature up to exhibit itself as a coherence of forcescalculable in advance, it therefore orders its experiments preciselyfor the purpose of asking whether and how nature reports itselfwhen set up in this way.

But after all, mathematical physics arose almost two centuriesbefore technology. How, then, could it have already been setupon by modern technology and placed in its service? The factstestify to the contrary. Surely technology got under way only

when it could be supported by exact physical science. Reckonedchronologically, this is correct. Thought historically, it does nothit upon the truth.

The modern physical theory of nature prepares the way firstnot simply for technology but for the essence of modern tech-nology. For already in physics the challenging gathering-togetherinto ordering revealing holds sway. But in it that gathering doesnot yet come expressly to appearance. Modern physics is theherald of Enframing, a herald whose origin is still unknown. Theessence of modern technology has for a long time been conceal-ing itself, even where power machinery has been invented, whereelectrical technology is in full swing, and where atomic tech-nology is well under way.

All coming to presence, not only modern technology, keepsitself everywhere concealed to the last.19 Nevertheless, it re-mains, with respect to its holding sway, that which precedes all:the earliest. The Greek thinkers already knew of this when theysaid: That which is earlier with regard to the arising that holdssway becomes manifest to us men only later. That which isprimally early shows itself only ultimately to men.20 Therefore,in the realm of thinking, a painstaking effort to think throughstill more primally what was primally thought is not the absurdwish to revive what is past, but rather the sober readiness to beastounded before the coming of what is early.

Chronologically speaking, modern physical science begins inthe seventeenth century. In contrast, machine-power technologydevelops only in the second half of the eighteenth century. Butmodern technology, which for chronological reckoning is thelater, is, from the point of view of the essence holding swaywithin it, the historically earlier.

19\. \"Coming to presence\" here translates the gerund Wesende, a verbalform that appears, in this volume, only in this essay. With the introductioninto the discussion of \"coming to presence\" as an alternate translation ofthe noun Wesen (essence), subsequent to Heidegger\'s consideration of themeaning of essence below (pp. 30 ff.), occasionally the presence of dasWesende is regrettably but unavoidably obscured.

20\. \"That which is primally early\" translates die anfdngliche Fruhe. Fora discussion of that which \"is to all present and absent beings . . . theearliest and most ancient at once\"---i.e., Ereignen, das Ereignis---see \"TheWay to Language\" in On the Way to Language, trans. Peter D. Hertz (NewYork: Harper & Row, 1971), p. 127.

If modern physics must resign itself ever increasingly to thefact that its realm of representation remains inscrutable andincapable of being visualized, this resignation is not dictated byany committee of researchers. It is challenged forth by the ruleof Enframing, which demands that nature be orderable asstanding-reserve. Hence physics, in all its retreating from therepresentation turned only toward objects that has alone beenstandard till recently, will never be able to renounce this onething: that nature reports itself in some way or other that isidentifiable through calculation and that it remains orderableas a system of information. This system is determined, then, outof a causality that has changed once again. Causality now dis-plays neither the character of the occasioning that brings forthnor the nature of the causa efficiens, let alone that of the causaformalis. It seems as though causality is shrinking into a re-porting---a reporting challenged forth---of standing-reserves thatmust be guaranteed either simultaneously or in sequence. To thisshrinking would correspond the process of growing resignationthat Heisenberg\'s lecture depicts in so impressive a manner.\*

Because the essence of modern technology lies in Enframing,modern technology must employ exact physical science. Throughits so doing, the deceptive illusion arises that modern technologyis applied physical science. This illusion can maintain itself onlyso long as neither the essential origin of modern science norindeed the essence of modern technology is adequately foundout through questioning.

We are questioning concerning technology in order to bring tolight our relationship to its essence. The essence of modern tech-nology shows itself in what we call Enframing. But simply topoint to this is still in no way to answer the question concerningtechnology, if to answer means to respond, in the sense ofcorrespond, to the essence of what is being asked about.

Where do we find ourselves brought to, if now we think onestep further regarding what Enframing itself actually is? It isnothing technological, nothing on the order of a machine. It isthe way in which the real reveals itself as standing-reserve.

\* W. Heisenberg, \"Das Naturbild in der heutigen Physik,\" in Die Kunsteim technischen Zeitalter (Munich, 1954), pp. 43 ff.

Again we ask: Does this revealing happen somewhere beyondall human doing? No. But neither does it happen exclusively inman, or decisively through man.

Enframing is the gathering together that belongs to thatsetting-upon which sets upon man and puts him in position toreveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Asthe one who is challenged forth in this way, man stands withinthe essential realm of Enframing. He can never take up a rela-tionship to it only subsequently. Thus the question as to howwe are to arrive at a relationship to the essence of technology,asked in this way, always comes too late. But never too latecomes the question as to whether we actually experience our-selves as the ones whose activities everywhere, public and pri-vate, are challenged forth by Enframing. Above all, never toolate comes the question as to whether and how we actuallyadmit ourselves into that wherein Enframing itself comes topresence.

The essence of modern technology starts man upon the wayof that revealing through which the real everywhere, more orless distinctly, becomes standing-reserve. \'To start upon a way\"means \"to send\" in our ordinary language. We shall call thatsending-that-gathers \[versammelde Schicken\] which first startsman upon a way of revealing, destining \[Geschick\].21 It is fromout of this destining that the essence of all history \[Geschichte\]is determined. History is neither simply the object of writtenchronicle nor simply the fulfillment of human activity. Thatactivity first becomes history as something destined.\* And it isonly the destining into objectifying representation that makes thehistorical accessible as an object for historiography, i.e., for ascience, and on this basis makes possible the current equatingof the historical with that which is chronicled.

Enframing, as a challenging-forth into ordering, sends into away of revealing. Enframing is an ordaining of destining, as is

21\. For a further presentation of the meaning resident in Geschick andthe related verb schicken, cf. T 38 ff., and Introduction, pp. xxviii ff.

\* See Vom Wesen der Wahrheit, 1930; 1st ed., 1943, pp. 16 ff. \[Englishtranslation, \"On the Essence of Truth,\" in Existence and Being, ed. WernerBrock (Chicago: Regnery, 1949), pp. 308 ff.\]

every way of revealing. Bringing-forth, poiesis, is also a destiningin this sense.

Always the unconcealment of that which is22 goes upon a wayof revealing. Always the destining of revealing holds completesway over man. But that destining is never a fate that compels.For man becomes truly free only insofar as he belongs to therealm of destining and so becomes one who listens and hears\[Horender\], and not one who is simply constrained to obey\[Horiger\].

The essence of freedom is originally not connected with thewill or even with the causality of human willing.

Freedom governs the open in the sense of the cleared andlighted up, i.e., of the revealed.23 It is to the happening of reveal-ing, i.e., of truth, that freedom stands in the closest and mostintimate kinship. All revealing belongs within a harboring and aconcealing. But that which frees---the mystery---is concealed andalways concealing itself. All revealing comes out of the open,goes into the open, and brings into the open. The freedom ofthe open consists neither in unfettered arbitrariness nor in theconstraint of mere laws. Freedom is that which conceals in a waythat opens to light, in whose clearing there shimmers that veilthat covers what comes to presence of all truth and lets the veilappear as what veils. Freedom is the realm of the destining thatat any given time starts a revealing upon its way.

The essence of modern technology lies in Enframing. Enfram-ing belongs within the destining of revealing. These sentencesexpress something different from the talk that we hear morefrequently, to the effect that technology is the fate of our age,where \"fate\" means the inevitableness of an unalterable course.

But when we consider the essence of technology, then we ex-perience Enframing as a destining of revealing. In this way weare already sojourning within the open space of destining, adestining that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion topush on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same

thing, to rebel helplessly against it and curse it as the work ofthe devil. Quite to the contrary, when we once open ourselvesexpressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves un-expectedly taken into a freeing claim.

The essence of technology lies in Enframing. Its holding swaybelongs within destining. Since destining at any given time startsman on a way of revealing, man, thus under way, is continuallyapproaching the brink of the possibility of pursuing and pushingforward nothing but what is revealed in ordering, and of deriv-ing all his standards on this basis. Through this the other possi-bility is blocked, that man might be admitted more and soonerand ever more primally to the essence of that which is uncon-cealed and to its unconcealment, in order that he might experi-ence as his essence his needed belonging to revealing.

Placed between these possibilities, man is endangered from outof destining. The destining of revealing is as such, in every oneof its modes, and therefore necessarily, danger.

In whatever way the destining of revealing may hold sway,the unconcealment in which everything that is shows itself atany given time harbors the danger that man may quail at the un-concealed and may misinterpret it. Thus where everything thatpresences exhibits itself in the light of a cause-effect coherence,even God can, for representational thinking, lose all that isexalted and holy, the mysteriousness of his distance. In thelight of causality, God can sink to the level of a cause, of causaefficiens. He then becomes, even in theology, the god of thephilosophers, namely, of those who define the unconcealed andthe concealed in terms of the causality of making, without everconsidering the essential origin of this causality.

In a similar way the unconcealment in accordance with whichnature presents itself as a calculable complex of the effects offorces can indeed permit correct determinations; but preciselythrough these successes the danger can remain that in the midstof all that is correct the true will withdraw.

The destining of revealing is in itself not just any danger, butdanger as such.

Yet when destining reigns in the mode of Enframing, it is thesupreme danger. This danger attests itself to us in two ways. Assoon as what is unconcealed no longer concerns man even as

object, but does so, rather, exclusively as standing-reserve, andman in the midst of objectlessness is nothing but the orderer ofthe standing-reserve, then he comes to the very brink of aprecipitous fall; that is, he comes to the point where he himselfwill have to be taken as standing-reserve. Meanwhile man, pre-cisely as the one so threatened, exalts himself to the posture oflord of the earth. In this way the impression comes to prevail thateverything man encounters exists only insofar as it is his con-struct. This illusion gives rise in turn to one final delusion: Itseems as though man everywhere and always encounters onlyhimself. Heisenberg has with complete correctness pointed outthat the real must present itself to contemporary man in thisway.\* In truth, however, precisely nowhere does man today anylonger encounter himself, i.e., his essence. Man stands so de-cisively in attendance on the challenging-forth of Enframing thathe does not apprehend Enframing as a claim, that he fails to seehimself as the one spoken to, and hence also fails in every wayto hear in what respect he ek-sists, from out of his essence, in therealm of an exhortation or address, and thus can never encounteronly himself.

But Enframing does not simply endanger man in his relation-ship to himself and to everything that is. As a destining, itbanishes man into that kind of revealing which is an ordering.Where this ordering holds sway, it drives out every other possi-bility of revealing. Above all, Enframing conceals that revealingwhich, in the sense of poiesis, lets what presences come forthinto appearance. As compared with that other revealing, thesetting-upon that challenges forth thrusts man into a relation tothat which is, that is at once antithetical and rigorously ordered.Where Enframing holds sway, regulating and securing of thestanding-reserve mark all revealing. They no longer even lettheir own fundamental characteristic appear, namely, this re-vealing as such.

Thus the challenging Enframing not only conceals a formerway of revealing, bringing-forth, but it conceals revealing itselfand with it That wherein unconcealment, i.e., truth, comes topass.

\* \"Das Naturbild,\" pp. 60 ff.

Enframing blocks the shining-forth and holding-sway of truth.The destining that sends into ordering is consequently the ex-treme danger. What is dangerous is not technology. There is nodemonry of technology, but rather there is the mystery of itsessence. The essence of technology, as a destining of revealing, isthe danger. The transformed meaning of the word \"Enframing\"will perhaps become somewhat more familiar to us now if wethink Enframing in the sense of destining and danger.

The threat to man does not come in the first instance fromthe potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology. Theactual threat has already affected man in his essence. The ruleof Enframing threatens man with the possibility that it couldbe denied to him to enter into a more original revealing andhence to experience the call of a more primal truth.

Thus, where Enframing reigns, there is danger in the highestsense.

But where danger is, growsThe saving power also.

Let us think carefully about these words of Holderlin. Whatdoes it mean \"to save\"? Usually we think that it means only toseize hold of a thing threatened by ruin, in order to secure it inits former continuance. But the verb \"to save\" says more. \"Tosave\" is to fetch something home into its essence, in order tobring the essence for the first time into its genuine appearing.If the essence of technology, Enframing, is the extreme danger,and if there is truth in Holderlin\'s words, then the rule ofEnframing cannot exhaust itself solely in blocking all lighting-upof every revealing, all appearing of truth. Rather, precisely theessence of technology must harbor in itself the growth of thesaving power. But in that case, might not an adequate look intowhat Enframing is as a destining of revealing bring into appear-ance the saving power in its arising?

In what respect does the saving power grow there also wherethe danger is? Where something grows, there it takes root, fromthence it thrives. Both happen concealedly and quietly and intheir own time. But according to the words of the poet we haveno right whatsoever to expect that there where the danger is we

should be able to lay hold of the saving power immediately andwithout preparation. Therefore we must consider now, in ad-vance, in what respect the saving power does most profoundlytake root and thence thrive even in that wherein the extremedanger lies, in the holding sway of Enframing. In order to con-sider this, it is necessary, as a last step upon our way, to lookwith yet clearer eyes into the danger. Accordingly, we must oncemore question concerning technology. For we have said that intechnology\'s essence roots and thrives the saving power.

But how shall we behold the saving power in the essence oftechnology so long as we do not consider in what sense of\"essence\" it is that Enframing is actually the essence of tech-nology?

Thus far we have understood \"essence\" in its current meaning.In the academic language of philosophy, \"essence\" means whatsomething is; in Latin, quid. Quidditas, whatness, provides theanswer to the question concerning essence. For example, whatpertains to all kinds of trees---oaks, beeches, birches, firs---is thesame \"treeness.\" Under this inclusive genus---the \"universal\"---fall all real and possible trees. Is then the essence of technology,Enframing, the common genus for everything technological? Ifthat were the case then the steam turbine, the radio transmitter,and the cyclotron would each be an Enframing. But the word\"Enframing\" does not mean here a tool or any kind of apparatus.Still less does it mean the general concept of such resources. Themachines and apparatus are no more cases and kinds of Enfram-ing than are the man at the switchboard and the engineer inthe drafting room. Each of these in its own way indeed belongsas stockpart, available resource, or executer, within Enframing;but Enframing is never the essence of technology in the sense ofa genus. Enframing is a way of revealing having the character ofdestining, namely, the way that challenges forth. The revealingthat brings forth (poiesis) is also a way that has the character ofdestining. But these ways are not kinds that, arrayed beside oneanother, fall under the concept of revealing. Revealing is thatdestining which, ever suddenly and inexplicably to all thinking,apportions itself into the revealing that brings forth and that alsochallenges, and which allots itself to man. The challenging reveal-

ing has its origin as a destining in bringing-forth. But at thesame time Enframing, in a way characteristic of a destining,blocks poiesis.

Thus Enframing, as a destining of revealing, is indeed theessence of technology, but never in the sense of genus andessentia. If we pay heed to this, something astounding strikes us:It is technology itself that makes the demand on us to think inanother way what is usually understood by \"essence.\" But inwhat way?

If we speak of the \"essence of a house\" and the \"essence of astate,\" we do not mean a generic type; rather we mean the waysin which house and state hold sway, administer themselves,develop and decay---the way in which they \"essence\" \[Wesen\],Johann Peter Hebel in a poem, \"Ghost on Kanderer Street,\" forwhich Goethe had a special fondness, uses the old word dieWeserei. It means the city hall inasmuch as there the life of thecommunity gathers and village existence is constantly in play, i.e.,comes to presence. It is from the verb wesen that the nounis derived. Wesen understood as a verb is the same as wahren\[to last or endure\], not only in terms of meaning, but also interms of the phonetic formation of the word. Socrates and Platoalready think the essence of something as what essences, whatcomes to presence, in the sense of what endures. But they thinkwhat endures as what remains permanently \[das Fortwahrende\](aei on). And they find what endures permanently in what, asthat which remains, tenaciously persists throughout all that hap-pens. That which remains they discover, in turn, in the aspect\[Aussehen\] (eidos, idea), for example, the Idea \"house.\"

The Idea \"house\" displays what anything is that is fashionedas a house. Particular, real, and possible houses, in contrast, arechanging and transitory derivatives of the Idea and thus belongto what does not endure.

But it can never in any way be established that enduring isbased solely on what Plato thinks as idea and Aristotle thinksas to ti en einai (that which any particular thing has always been),or what metaphysics in its most varied interpretations thinks asessentia.

All essencing endures. But is enduring only permanent en-during? Does the essence of technology endure in the sense of

the permanent enduring of an Idea that hovers over everythingtechnological, thus making it seem that by technology we meansome mythological abstraction? The way in which technologyessences lets itself be seen only from out of that permanentenduring in which Enframing comes to pass as a destining ofrevealing. Goethe once uses the mysterious word fortgewahren\[to grant permanently\] in place of fortwahren \[to endure perma-nently\].\* He hears wahren \[to endure\] and gewahren \[to grant\]here in one unarticulated accord.24 And if we now ponder morecarefully than we did before what it is that actually endures andperhaps alone endures, we may venture to say: Only what isgranted endures. That which endures primally out of the earliestbeginning is what grants.25

As the essencing of technology, Enframing is that which en-dures. Does Enframing hold sway at all in the sense of granting?No doubt the question seems a horrendous blunder. For accordingto everything that has been said, Enframing is, rather, a destiningthat gathers together into the revealing that challenges forth.Challenging is anything but a granting. So it seems, so long aswe do not notice that the challenging-forth into the orderingof the real as standing-reserve still remains a destining that startsman upon a way of revealing. As this destining, the coming topresence of technology gives man entry into That which, ofhimself, he can neither invent nor in any way make. For thereis no such thing as a man who, solely of himself, is only man.

But if this destining, Enframing, is the extreme danger, notonly for man\'s coming to presence, but for all revealing as such,should this destining still be called a granting? Yes, most emphat-

24\. The verb gewahren is closely allied to the verbs wahren (to endure)and wahren (to watch over, to keep safe, to preserve). Gewahren ordinarilymeans to be surety for, to warrant, to vouchsafe, to grant. In the discussionthc.t follows, the verb will be translated simply with \"to grant.\" But thereader should keep in mind also the connotations of safeguarding andguaranteeing that are present in it as well.

ically, if in this destining the saving power is said to grow.Every destining of revealing comes to pass from out of a grantingand as such a granting. For it is granting that first conveys to manthat share in revealing which the coming-to-pass of revealingneeds.2\'\' As the one so needed and used, man is given to belongto the coming-to-pass of truth. The granting that sends in oneway or another into revealing is as such the saving power. For thesaving power lets man see and enter into the highest dignity ofhis essence. This dignity lies in keeping watch over the uncon-cealment---and with it, from the first, the concealment---of allcoming to presence on this earth. It is precisely in Enframing,which threatens to sweep man away into ordering as the sup-posed single way of revealing, and so thrusts man into thedanger of the surrender of his free essence---it is precisely inthis extreme danger that the innermost indestructible belong-ingness of man within granting may come to light, provided thatwe, for our part, begin to pay heed to the coming to presence oftechnology.

Thus the coming to presence of technology harbors in itselfwhat we least suspect, the possible arising of the saving power.

Everything, then, depends upon this: that we ponder thisarising and that, recollecting, we watch over it. How can thishappen? Above all through our catching sight of what comesto presence in technology, instead of merely staring at the tech-nological. So long as we represent technology as an instrument,we remain held fast in the will to master it. We press on pastthe essence of technology.

When, however, we ask how the instrumental comes to pres-ence as a kind of causality, then we experience this coming topresence as the destining of a revealing.

When we consider, finally, that the coming to presence of theessence of technology comes to pass in the granting that needsand uses man so that he may share in revealing, then the follow-ing becomes clear:

Here and subsequently in this essay, \"coming-to-pass\" translates thenoun Ereignis. Elsewhere, in \'The Turning,\" this word, in accordance withthe deeper meaning that Heidegger there finds for it, will be translated with\"disclosing that brings into its own.\" See T 45; see also Introduction, pp.

wwi-xxxvii.

The essence of technology is in a lofty sense ambiguous. Suchambiguity points to the mystery of all revealing, i.e., of truth.

On the one hand, Enframing challenges forth into the frenzied-ness of ordering that blocks every view into the coming-to-passof revealing and so radically endangers the relation to the essenceof truth.

On the other hand, Enframing comes to pass for its part in thegranting that lets man endure---as yet unexperienced, but per-haps more experienced in the future---that he may be the onewho is needed and used for the safekeeping of the coming topresence of truth.2\' Thus does the arising of the saving powerappear.

The irresistibility of ordering and the restraint of the savingpower draw past each other like the paths of two stars in thecourse of the heavens. But precisely this, their passing by, is thehidden side of their nearness.

When we look into the ambiguous essence of technology, webehold the constellation, the stellar course of the mystery.

The question concerning technology is the question concern-ing the constellation in which revealing and concealing, in whichthe coming to presence of truth, comes to pass.

But what help is it to us to look into the constellation of truth?We look into the danger and see the growth of the saving power.

Through this we are not yet saved. But we are thereupon sum-moned to hope in the growing light of the saving power. Howcan this happen? Here and now and in little things, that we mayfoster the saving power in its increase. This includes holdingalways before our eyes the extreme danger.

The coming to presence of technology threatens revealing,threatens it with the possibility that all revealing will be con-sumed in ordering and that everything will present itself onlyin the unconcealedness of standing-reserve. Human activity cannever directly counter this danger. Human achievement alonecan never banish it. But human reflection can ponder the fact that

27\. \"Safekeeping\" translates the noun Wahrnis, which is unique to Hei-degger. Wahrnis is closely related to the verb wahren (to watch over, tokeep safe, to preserve), integrally related to Wahrheit (truth), and closelyakin to wahren (to endure) and gewahren (to be surety for, to grant). Onthe meaning of Wahrnis, see T 42, n. 9 and n. 12 above.

all saving power must be of a higher essence than what is en-dangered, though at the same time kindred to it.

But might there not perhaps be a more primally granted re-vealing that could bring the saving power into its first shiningforth in the midst of the danger, a revealing that in the techno-logical age rather conceals than shows itself?

There was a time when it was not technology alone that borethe name techne. Once that revealing that brings forth truth intothe splendor of radiant appearing also was called techne.

Once there was a time when the bringing-forth of the true intothe beautiful was called techne. And the poiesis of the fine artsalso was called techne.

In Greece, at the outset of the destining of the West, the artssoared to the supreme height of the revealing granted them.They brought the presence \[Gegenwart\] of the gods, brought thedialogue of divine and human destinings, to radiance. And artwas simply called techne. It was a single, manifold revealing. Itwas pious, promos, i.e., yielding to the holding-sway and thesafekeeping of truth.

The arts were not derived from the artistic. Art works werenot enjoyed aesthetically. Art was not a sector of cultural ac-tivity.

What, then, was art---perhaps only for that brief but mag-nificent time? Why did art bear the modest name techne? Be-cause it was a revealing that brought forth and hither, andtherefore belonged within poiesis. It was finally that revealingwhich holds complete sway in all the fine arts, in poetry, and ineverything poetical that obtained poiesis as its proper name.

The same poet from whom we heard the words

But where danger is, growsThe saving power also.

says to us:

poetically dwells man upon this earth.

The poetical brings the true into the splendor of what Platoin the Phaedrus calls to ekphanestaton, that which shines forthmost purely. The poetical thoroughly pervades every art, everyrevealing of coming to presence into the beautiful.

The Question Concerning Technology 35

Could it be that the fine arts are called to poetic revealing?Could it be that revealing lays claim to the arts most primally,so that they for their part may expressly foster the growth ofthe saving power, may awaken and found anew our look into thatwhich grants and our trust in it?

Whether art may be granted this highest possibility of itsessence in the midst of the extreme danger, no one can tell. Yetwe can be astounded. Before what? Before this other possibility:that the frenziedness of technology may entrench itself every-where to such an extent that someday, throughout everythingtechnological, the essence of technology may come to presencein the coming-to-pass of truth.

Because the essence of technology is nothing technological,essential reflection upon technology and decisive confrontationwith it must happen in a realm that is, on the one hand, akin tothe essence of technology and, on the other, fundamentallydifferent from it.

Such a realm is art. But certainly only if reflection on art,for its part, does not shut its eyes to the constellation of truthafter which we are questioning.

Thus questioning, we bear witness to the crisis that in our sheerpreoccupation with technology we do not yet experience thecoming to presence of technology, that in our sheer aesthetic-mindedness we no longer guard and preserve the coming topresence of art. Yet the more questioningly we ponder the es-sence of technology, the more mysterious the essence of artbecomes.

The closer we come to the danger, the more brightly do theways into the saving power begin to shine and the more question-ing we become. For questioning is the piety of thought.

The essence1 of Enframing is that setting-upon gathered intoitself which entraps the truth of its own coming to presence withoblivion.2 This entrapping disguises itself, in that it develops

1\. Throughout this essay the noun Wesen will sometimes be given itstraditional translation \"essence,\" but more often it will be translated with\"coming to presence.\" For Heidegger the essence of anything is its \"endur-ing as presence.\" As such, it is the manner in which anything in its en-during comports itself effectually as what it is, i.e., the manner in which it\"holds sway\" through time (see QT 30; 3, n. 1). Thus in this essay the Wesenof that enframing summons---\"Enframing,\" das Ge-stell---which governs themodern age is the \"challenging setting-upon\" (Stellen) that sets everythingin place as supply, ruling in modern technology (cf. QT 15, n. 14; 19, n. 17);the Wesen of modern technology is Enframing itself; the Wesen of Being isthe manner in which Being endures, at any given time, as the Being ofwhatever is (cf. p. 38); the Wesen of man is that dwelling in openness, ac-complished through language and thinking, wherein Being can be and ispreserved and set free into presence (cf. p\"p. 39-42 and \"Time and Being\" inOn Time and Being, trans. Joan Stambaugh \[New York: Harper & Row,1972\], p. 12).

2\. Vergessenheit (oblivion) is not to be confused with the propensity toforget things or with a lapse of memory. In this essay, as for Heideggergenerally, Vergessenheit is to be understood in the positive sense of theGreek lethe. It is that concealedness which is the source and foundation ofall unconcealedness or truth (aletheia). There can be no unveiling unlessthere is concealment from whence it comes. The words of Heraclitus, physiskryptesthai philei---ordinarily translated \"nature loves to hide\"---would berendered by Heidegger approximately as \"concealedness is the very heart ofcoming into appearance\" (from the transcript of the \"Seminaire tenu auThor en septembre 1969 par le Professeur Martin Heidegger,\" p. 21).

The Turning 37

into the setting in order of everything that presences as standing-reserve, establishes itself in the standing-reserve, and rules asthe standing-reserve.

Enframing comes to presence as the danger. But does the dan-ger therewith announce itself as the danger? No. To be sure,men are at all times and in all places exceedingly oppressed bydangers and exigencies. But the danger, namely, Being itselfendangering itself in the truth of its coming to presence, remainsveiled and disguised. This disguising is what is most dangerousin the danger. In keeping with this disguising of the dangerthrough the ordering belonging to Enframing, it seems time andtime again as though technology were a means in the hands ofman. But, in truth, it is the coming to presence of man that isnow being ordered forth to lend a hand to the coming to pres-ence of technology.

Does this mean that man, for better or worse, is helplesslydelivered over to technology? No, it means the direct opposite;and not only that, but essentially it means something more thanthe opposite, because it means something different.

If Enframing is a destining of the coming to presence of Beingitself, then we may venture to suppose that Enframing, as oneamong Being\'s modes of coming to presence, changes. For whatgives destining its character as destining is that it takes place soas suitably to adapt itself to the ordaining that is ever one.3 Totake place so as to adapt means to set out in order to adjustfittingly to the directing already made apparent---for which an-other destining, yet veiled, is waiting. That which has the char-acter of destining moves, in itself, at any given time, toward aspecial moment that sends it into another destining, in which,however, it is not simply submerged and lost. We are still too

3\. \"Destining\" translates Geschick, which ordinarily means skill, aptitude,fitness, as well as fate or destiny, and is here regularly rendered by \"destin-ing.\" The expressions \"ordaining\" and \"takes place so as suitably to adaptitself\" render words closely allied to Geschick. \"Ordaining\" translatesSchickung, meaning providential decree, dispensation. \"To take place so assuitably to adapt\" translates the verb sich schicken, which means to cometo pass or happen, to suit or be fit, to accommodate oneself, to agree with,to match or blend. In this essay, where Heidegger\'s central concern is withturning about, a changing of direction, the connotations of aptness, fitness,and self-adapting brought forward for Geschick in this passage shouldalways be kept in mind for the word \"destining.\" Cf. QT 24.

38 The Question Concerning Technology

inexperienced and thoughtless to think the essence of the his-torical from out of destining and ordaining and taking place soas to adapt. We are still too easily inclined, out of habit, toconceive that which has the character of destining in terms ofhappening, and to represent the latter as an expiration, a passingaway, of events that have been established historiographically.We locate history in the realm of happening, instead of thinkinghistory in accordance with its essential origin from out of des-tining. But destining is essentially destining of Being, indeedin such a way that Being itself takes place so as to adapt itself,and ever comes to presence as a destining and, accordingly,changes in the manner of a destining. If a change in Being---i.e., now, in the coming to presence of Enframing---comes topass, then this in no way means that technology, whose essencelies in Enframing, will be done away with.4 Technology will notbe struck down; and it most certainly will not be destroyed.

If the essence, the coming to presence, of technology, Enfram-ing as the danger within Being, is Being itself, then technologywill never allow itself to be mastered, either positively or nega-tively, by a human doing founded merely on itself. Technology,whose essence is Being itself, will never allow itself to be over-come by men. That would mean, after all, that man was themaster of Being.

Nevertheless, because Being, as the essence of technology, hasadapted itself into Enframing, and because man\'s coming topresence belongs to the coming to presence of Being---inasmuchas Being\'s coming to presence needs the coming to presence ofman, in order to remain kept safe as Being in keeping with itsown coming to presence in the midst of whatever is, and thus

4\. The phrase \"comes to pass\" renders the German verb sich ereignet(from sich ereignen, to happen or take place). The noun Ereignis usuallymeans, correspondingly, event. Later in this essay (p. 45), Heidegger pointsto the fact that Ereignis, and with it necessarily sich ereignen, embodies themeanings of the two verbs eignen (to be one\'s own, to suit, to belong to),and the archaic eraugnen (to bring before the eyes, to bring to sight). Hesays: Ereignis ist eignende Erdugnis (\"Disclosing coming-to-pass is bring-ing-to-sight that brings into its own\") (p. 45). Although the introduction ofthis fullness of meaning for sich ereignen and Ereignis has been reservedin the translation for the point at which Heidegger\'s definitive statement ismade, that meaning clearly informs the argument of the essay throughoutand should therefore be borne in mind.

The Turning 39

as Being to endure as present---for \'this reason the coming topresence of technology cannot be led into the change of itsdestining without the cooperation of the coming to presence ofman. Through this cooperation, however, technology will notbe overcome \[uberwunden\] by men. On the contrary, the comingto presence of technology will be surmounted \[verwunden\] in away that restores it into its yet concealed truth. This restoringsurmounting is similar to what happens when, in the humanrealm, one gets over grief or pain. But the surmounting of adestining of Being---here and now, the surmounting of Enfram-ing---each time comes to pass out of the arrival of anotherdestining, a destining that does not allow itself either to be logi-cally and historiographically predicted or to be metaphysicallyconstrued\'as a sequence belonging to a process of history. Fornever does the historical---let alone happening itself as rep-resented historiographically---determine destining; but ratherhappening, together with the representation of the constancyassigned to it, is already in each instance that which, belongingto a destining of Being, has the character of destining.

Man is indeed needed and used for the restorative surmount-ing of the essence of technology. But man is used here in hisessence that corresponds to that surmounting. In keeping withthis, man\'s essence must first open itself to the essence of tech-nology. This opening is, in terms of that coming-to-pass whichdiscloses, something quite different from the event of man\'saffirming technology and its means and promoting them. How-ever, in order that man in his essence may become attentive tothe essence of technology, and in order that there may befounded an essential relationship between technology and manin respect to their essence, modern man must first and above allfind his way back into the full breadth of the space proper tohis essence. That essential space of man\'s essential being re-ceives the dimension that unites it to something beyond itselfsolely from out of the conjoining relation \[Ver-hciltnis\] that isthe way in which the safekeeping of Being itself is given tobelong to the essence of man as the one who is needed and usedby Being. Unless man first establishes himself beforehand inthe space proper to his essence and there takes up his dwelling,he will not be capable of anything essential within the destining

now holding sway. In pondering this let us pay heed to a wordof Meister Eckhart, as we think it in keeping with what is mostfundamental to it. It reads: \"Those who are not of a greatessence, whatever work they perform, nothing comes of it\"5(Reden der Unterscheidung, No. 4).

It is toward the great essence of man that we are thinking,inasmuch as man\'s essence belongs to the essence of Being andis needed by Being to keep safe the coming to presence of Beinginto its truth.

Therefore, what is necessary above all is this: that beforehandwe ponder the essence of Being as that which is worthy ofthinking; that beforehand, in thinking this, we experience towhat extent we are called upon first to trace a path for suchexperiencing and to prepare that path as a way into that whichtill now has been impassable.

All this we can do only if, before considering the question thatis seemingly always the most immediate one and the only urgentone, What shall we do? we ponder this: How must we think?For thinking is genuine activity, genuine taking a hand, if totake a hand means to lend a hand to the essence, the coming topresence, of Being. This means: to prepare (build) for the com-ing to presence of Being that abode in the midst of whatever isr\'which Being brings itself and its essence to utterance inlanguage. Language first gives to every purposeful deliberationits ways and its byways. Without language, there would belacking to every doing every dimension in which it could bestir

Thenecessity in English of translating Sein, when it appears as a noun, with\"Being\" precludes the possibility of the use of the most obvious translation,\"being,\" for Seiendes. A phrase such as the \"Being of being\" or \"Being inthe midst of being\" would clearly present unacceptable difficulties. Heideg-ger does not intend das Seiende to refer primarily to any mere aggregate ofentities or beings, let alone to a particular being. The word connotes forhim, first of all, the intricately interrelated entirety of all that is, in whose\"is\" Being is made manifest. The verbal force of the participle is alwayssignificantly present. In these essays, the translation of das Seiende willvary according to the demands of particular contexts. The translations\"what is,\" \"whatever is,\" \"that which is,\" \"what is in being,\" \"whatever isin being,\" and \"that which is in being\" will ordinarily be used.

itself and be effective. In view of this, language is never pri-marily the expression of thinking, feeling, and willing. Languageis the primal dimension within which man\'s essence is first ableto correspond at all to Being and its claim, and, in correspond-ing, to belong to Being. This primal corresponding, expresslycarried out, is thinking. Through thinking, we first learn to dwellin the realm in which there comes to pass the restorative sur-mounting of the destining of Being, the surmounting of En-framing.

The coming to presence of Enframing is the danger. As thedanger, Being turns about into the oblivion of its coming topresence, turns away from this coming to presence, and in thatway simultaneously turns counter to the truth of its coming topresence. In the danger there holds sway this turning about notyet thought on. In the coming to presence of the danger thereconceals itself, therefore, the possibility of a turning in whichthe oblivion belonging to the coming to presence of Being willso turn itself that, with this turning, the truth of the coming topresence of Being will expressly turn in---turn homeward---intowhatever is.\'

Yet probably this turning---the turning of the oblivion ofBeing into the safekeeping belonging to the coming to presenceof Being---will finally come to pass only when the danger, whichis in its concealed essence ever susceptible of turning, first comesexpressly to light as the danger that it is. Perhaps we standalready in the shadow cast ahead by the advent of this turning.When and how it will come to pass after the manner of a des-tining no one knows. Nor is it necessary that we know. A knowl-

The verbeinkehren means to turn in, to enter, to put up at an inn, to alight, to stay.The related noun Einkehr, translated in this essay as \"in-turning,\" meansputting up at an inn; an inn or lodging. Einkehren and Einkehr speak of athorough being at home that yet partakes of the transiency belonging tothe ongoing. Both words suggest the Heimkehr (homecoming) importantin Heidegger\'s earlier Holderlin essays. The allusion to a transient abidingmade here in these words leads toward Heidegger\'s culminating portrayalof the turning within Being as a self-clearing, i.e., a self-opening-up, aswhich and into which Being\'s own self-lighting that is a self-manifestingentering brings itself to pass. Cf. pp. 44-45, where we find, in immediateconjunction with Einkehr, the introduction of the nouns Einblick (entering,flashing glance, insight) and Einblitz (in-flashing).

42 The Question Concerning Technology

edge of this kind would even be most ruinous for man, becausehis essence is to be the one who waits, the one who attends uponthe coming to presence of Being in that in thinking he guards it.Only when man, as the shepherd of Being, attends upon thetruth of Being can he expect an arrival of a destining of Beingand not sink to the level of a mere wanting to know.

But what happens there where the danger comes to pass asthe danger and is thus for the first time unconcealedly danger?

That we may hear the answer to this question, let us give heedto the beckoning sign that is preserved in some words of Holder-lin. At the beginning of the later version of his Hymn \"Patmos,\"the poet says:

But where danger is, growsThe saving power also.\*

If now we think these words still more essentially than thepoet sang them, if we follow them in thought as far as they go,they say: Where the danger is as the danger, there the savingpower is already thriving also. The latter does not appear inci-dentally. The saving power is not secondary to the danger. Theselfsame danger is, when it is as the danger, the saving power.The danger is the saving power, inasmuch as it brings the savingpower out of its---the danger\'s---concealed essence that is eversusceptible of turning. What does \"to save\" mean? It means toloose, to emancipate, to free, to spare and husband, to harborprotectingly, to take under one\'s care, to keep safe. Lessing stilluses the word \"saving\" emphatically, in the sense of vindica-tion, i.e., to put something back into what is proper and right,into the essential/ and to keep it safe therein. That which genu-inely saves is that which keeps safe, safekeeping.9

His equating here of these two words withdas Rettende (the saving-power) draws into them all the connotations offreeing and safeguarding that he has just established for the latter. Wahren,ordinarily understood as to watch over, to keep safe, to preserve---and withit Wahrnis---clearly carries, simultaneously, connotations of freeing, i.e., ofallowing to be manifest. The same connotations are resident in all the

But where is the danger? What is the place for it? Inasmuchas the danger is Being itself, it is both nowhere and everywhere.It has no place as something other than itself. It is itself theplaceless dwelling place of all presencing. The danger is theepoch of Being coming to presence as Enframing.10

When the danger is as the danger, then its coming to presenceexpressly comes to pass. But the danger is the entrapping thatis the way in which Being itself, in the mode of Enframing, pur-sues with oblivion the safekeeping belonging to Being. In theentrapping, what comes to presence is this, that Being dismissesand puts away its truth into oblivion in such a way that Beingdenies its own coming to presence. When, accordingly, the dan-ger is as the danger, then the entrapping that is the way Beingitself entraps its truth with oblivion comes expressly to pass.When this cntrapping-with-oblivion does come expressly to pass,then oblivion as such turns in and abides. Thus rescued throughthis abiding from falling away out of remembrance, it is no longeroblivion. With such in-turning, the oblivion relating to Being\'ssafekeeping is no longer the oblivion of Being; but rather, turningin thus, it turns about into the safekeeping of Being. When thedanger is as the danger, with the turning about of oblivion, thesafekeeping of Being comes to pass; world comes to pass.\* Thatworld comes to pass as world, that the thing things, this is thedistant advent of the coming to presence of Being itself.

The self-denying of the truth of Being, which entraps itselfwith oblivion, harbors the favor as yet ungranted, that this self-entrapping will turn about; that, in such turning, oblivion willturn and become the safekeeping belonging to the coming to

presence of Being, instead of allowing that coming to presenceto fall into disguise. In the coming to presence of the danger therecomes to presence and dwells a favor, namely, the favor of theturning about of the oblivion of Being into the truth of Being.In the coming to presence of the danger, where it is as the dan-ger, is the turning about into the safekeeping, is this safekeepingitself, is the saving power of Being.

When the turning comes to pass in the danger, this can hap-pen only without mediation. For Being has no equal whatever.It is not brought about by anything else nor does it itself bringanything about. Being never at any time runs its course withina cause-effect coherence. Nothing that effects, as Being, precedesthe mode in which it---Being itself---takes place so as to adaptitself; and no effect, as Being, follows after. Sheerly, out of itsown essence of concealedness, Being brings itself to pass intoits epoch. Therefore we must pay heed:

The turning of the danger comes to pass suddenly. In thisturning, the clearing belonging to the essence of Being suddenlyclears itself and lights up. This sudden self-lighting is thelightning-flash. It brings itself into its own brightness, whichit itself both brings along and brings in. When, in the turningof the danger, the truth of Being flashes, the essence of Beingclears and lights itself up. Then the truth of the essence, thecoming to presence, of Being turns and enters in.

Toward where does in-turning bring itself to pass? Towaidnowhere except into Being itself, which is as yet coming topresence out of the oblivion of its truth. But this same Beingcomes to presence as the coming to presence of technology. Thecoming to presence of technology is Enframing. In-turning, asthe bringing to pass of the turning about of oblivion, turns ininto that which now is the epoch of Being. That which genuinelyis,11 is in no way this or that particular being. What genuinelyis, i.e., what expressly dwells and endures as present in the \'\'is,\"is uniquely Being. Only Being \"is/\' only in Being and as Beingdoes that which the \"is\" names bring itself to pass; that whichis, is Being from out of its essence.12

\'To flash \[blitzen\], in terms both of its derivation and of whatit designates, is \"to glance\" \[blicken\]. In the flashing glance andas that glance, the essence, the coming to presence, of Beingenters into its own emitting of light. Moving through the elementof its own shining, the flashing glance retrieves that which itcatches sight of and brings it back into the brightness of itsown looking. And yet that glancing, in its giving of light, si-multaneously keeps safe the concealed darkness of its origin asthe unlighted. The in-turning \[Einkehr\] that is the lightning-flash of the truth of Being is the entering, flashing glance---insight \[Einblick\]. We have thought the truth of Being in theworlding of world as the mirror play of the fourfold of sky andearth, mortals and divinities.\* When oblivion turns about, whenworld as the safekeeping of the coming to presence of Beingturns in, then there comes to pass the in-flashing \[Einblitz\] ofworld into the injurious neglect of the thing.13 That neglectcomes to pass in the mode of the rule of Enframing.

any German reader to think afresh; by specifically distinguishing das wasist from any use of the present participle Seiendes for \"this or that particu-lar being,\" he can set forth a distinction apparent in the words themselves.For the English-speaking reader of this volume, however, a different andmore difficult problem remains. Since das Seiende is very often translatedin these essays with \"what is,\" \"whatever is,\" and \"that which is,\" con-fusion could easily result in the present context. Only in the discussionnow underway, in two related passages in QT (pp. 25, 27), and in one otherinstance (WN 97) will \"that which is\" translate forms of das was ist; dasSeiende will be translated variously as \"what is,\" \"what is in being,\" and\"that which is in being.\"

In this and in the following sentence in the text,the reader should be reminded of the character of Enframing as that \"set-ting-upon that challenges forth\" which sets everything in place as supply,which orders everything as standing-reserve and hence keeps nothing safe,i.e., leaves nothing free to be as it genuinely is.

Insight into that which is, is itself the dis-closing that brings into its own, as which the truth of Beingrelates itself and stands in relation to truthless Being. Insightinto that which is---this names the constellation in the essenceof Being. This constellation is the dimension in which Beingcomes to presence as the danger.

From the first and almost to the last it has seemed as though\"insight into that which is\" means only a glance such as wemen throw out from ourselves into what is. We ordinarily take\"that which is\" to be whatever is in being. For the \"is\" is as-serted of what is in being. But now everything has turned about.Insight does not name any discerning examination \[Einsicht\]into what is in being that we conduct for ourselves; insight\[Einblick\] as in-flashing \[Einblitz\] is the disclosing coming-to-pass of the constellation of the turning within the coming topresence of Being itself, and that within the epoch of Enfram-ing. That which is, is in no way that which is in being. For the\"it is\" and the \"is\" are accorded to what is in being only inas-much as what is in being is appealed to in respect to its Being.In the \"is,\" \"Being\" is uttered: that which \"is,\" in the sense thatit constitutes the Being of what is in being, is Being.14

The ordering belonging to Enframing sets itself above thething, leaves it, as thing, unsafeguarded, truthless.15 In this wayEnframing disguises the nearness of world that nears in the thing.Enframing disguises even this, its disguising, just as the for-getting of something forgets itself and is drawn away in thewake of forgetful oblivion. The coming-to-pass of oblivion notonly lets fall from remembrance into concealment; but thatfalling itself falls simultaneously from remembrance into con-cealment, which itself also falls away in that falling.

The Turning 47

And yet---in all the disguising belonging to Enframing, thebright open-space of world lights up, the truth of Being flashes.At the instant, that is, when Enframing lights up, in its comingto presence, as the danger, i.e., as the saving-power. In Enfram-ing, moreover, as a destining of the coming to presence of Being,there comes to presence a light from the flashing of Being. En-framing is, though veiled, still glance, and no blind destiny inthe sense of a completely ordained fate.

Insight into that which is---thus do we name the sudden flashof the truth of Being into truthless Being.

When insight comes disclosingly to pass, then men are theones who are struck in their essence by the flashing of Being.In insight, men are the ones who are caught sight of.

Only when man, in the disclosing coming-to-pass of the in-sight by which he himself is beheld, renounces human self-willand projects himself toward that insight, away from himself,does he correspond in his essence to the claim of that insight.In thus corresponding man is gathered into his own \[ge-eignet\] ,1Gthat he, within the safeguarded element of world, may, as themortal, look out toward the divine.

Otherwise not; for the god also is---when he is---a being andstands as a being within Being and its coming to presence, whichbrings itself disclosingly to pass out of the worlding of world.17

16\. The translation \"gathered into his own\" for ge-eignet takes cogni-zance of the prefix ge-, which Heidegger has separated from the verb eignen(to be one\'s own). Heidegger repeatedly stresses the force of ge- as meaning\"gathering.\" Cf. e.g., QT 19. Here the suggestion of gathering points toman\'s belonging within the wholly mutual interrelating of the fourfold ofsky and earth, divinities and mortals. The ensuing allusions to \"the divine\"and \"the god\" bespeak the same context of thought (cf. \"The Thing,\"Poetry, Language, Thought, pp. 178 ff.). Ge-eignet speaks specifically ofthat bringing into its own which is the disclosing coming-to-pass (Ereignis)of the \"insight into that which is\" that is the in-flashing of Being into itsown enduring as presence---the in-flashing that brings to pass, in Being\'smanifesting of itself to itself, the worlding of world and the thinging of thething.

17\. \"The god\" of whom Heidegger speaks is not the god of the meta-physical-theological tradition of Christendom. Heidegger characteristicallythinks of a dimension of the divine that the divinities make manifest---asamong the Greeks, or for the Hebrew prophets, or in the preaching ofJesus---and toward which they beckon man. He can speak of the modernage as \"the time of the gods that have fled and of the god that is coming\"(\"Remembrance of the Poet,\" Tr. Douglas Scott, in Existence and Being,

48 The Question Concerning Technology

Only when insight brings itself disclosingly to pass, only whenthe coming to presence of technology lights up as Enframing, dowe discern how, in the ordering of the standing-reserve, the truthof Being remains denied as world. Only then do we notice thatall mere willing and doing in the mode of ordering steadfastlypersists in injurious neglect. In this same way all mere organiz-ing of the world conceived and represented historiographicallyin terms of universality remains truthless and without founda-tion. All mere chasing after the future so as to work out a pic-ture of it through calculation in order to extend what is presentand half-thought into what, now veiled, is yet to come, itselfstill moves within the prevailing attitude belonging to techno-logical, calculating representation. All attempts to reckon existingreality morphologically, psychologically, in terms of decline andloss, in terms of fate, catastrophe, and destruction, are merelytechnological behavior. That behavior operates through the de-vice of the enumerating of symptoms whose standing-reservecan be increased to infinity and always varied anew. Suchanalyses of the \"situation\" do not notice that they are workingonly according to the meaning and manner of technologicaldissecting, and that they thus furnish to the technological con-sciousness the historiographical-technological presentation ofhappening commensurate with that consciousness. But no his-toriographical representation of history as happening ever bringsus into the proper relation to destining, let alone into the essentialorigin of destining in the disclosing coming-to-pass of the truthof Being that brings everything into its own.

All that is merely technological never arrives at the essenceof technology. It cannot even once recognize its outer precincts.

Therefore, as we seek to give utterance to insight into thatwhich is, we do not describe the situation of our time. It is theconstellation of Being that is uttering itself to us.

But we do not yet hear, we whose hearing and seeing are per-ishing through radio and film under the rule of technology. The

introd. and analysis by Werner Brock \[Chicago: Regnery, 1949\], p. 288),and can anticipate a time when, through the fulfillment of the essence ofthat age, Being will make itself accessible to genuine questioning, and\"ample space\" will therewith be opened \"for the decision as to whetherBeing will once again become capable of a god\" (AWP 153).

The Turning 49

constellation of Being is the denial of world, in the form of in-jurious neglect of the thing. Denial is not nothing; it is thehighest mystery of Being within the rule of Enframing.

Whether the god lives or remains dead is not decided by thereligiosity of men and even less by the theological aspirationsof philosophy and natural science. Whether or not God is Godcomes disclosingly to pass from out of and within the con-stellation of Being.

So long as we do not, through thinking, experience what is,we can never belong to what will be.

Will insight into that which is bring itself disclosingly to pass?

Will we, as the ones caught sight of, be so brought home intothe essential glance of Being that we will no longer elude it?Will we arrive thereby within the essence of the nearness that,in thinging the thing, brings world near? Will we dwell as thoseat home in nearness, so that we will belong primally within thefourfold of sky and earth, mortals and divinities?

Will insight into that which is bring itself disclosingly to pass?Will we correspond to that insight, through a looking that looksinto the essence of technology and becomes aware of Being itselfwithin it?

Will we see the lightning-flash of Being in the essence of tech-nology? The flash that comes out of stillness, as stillness itself?Stillness stills. What does it still? It stills Being into the comingto presence of world.

May world in its worlding be the nearest of all nearing thatnears, as it brings the truth of Being near to man\'s essence, andso gives man to belong to the disclosing bringing-to-pass thatis a bringing into its own.

The Word of Nietzsche:\"QodhDead\"

The following exposition attempts to point the way toward theplace from which it may be possible someday to ask the questionconcerning the essence of nihilism.1 The exposition stems froma thinking that is for once just beginning to gain some clarityconcerning Nietzsche\'s fundamental position within the historyof Western metaphysics. This pointing of the way will clarifya stage in Western metaphysics that is probably its final stage;for inasmuch as through Nietzsche metaphysics has in a certainsense divested itself of its own essential possibility, other pos-sibilities of metaphysics can no longer appear. Through the over-turning of metaphysics accomplished by Nietzsche,1\' there re-mains for metaphysics nothing but a turning aside into its owninessentiality and disarray. The suprasensory is transformed

1\. \"Essence\" will be the translation of the noun Wesen throughout thisessay. The reader should continually keep in mind that the \"essence\" ofmetaphysics or of nihilism, of the will to power or of value or of truth,always means fundamentally for Heidegger the manner in which each, inits ongoing presence, \"holds sway\" and prevails as whatever it is. See QT3,n. 1, 30.

2\. Throughout this essay the word \"overturning\" (Umkehrung) is used inthe sense of an upsetting or a turning upside down, never in the sense ofan overcoming or conquest (Uberioindung).

into an unstable product of the sensory. And with such a debase-ment of its antithesis, the sensory denies its own essence. Thedeposing of the suprasensory does away with the merely sensoryand thus with the difference between the two. The deposing ofthe suprasensory culminates in a \"neither-nor\" in relation tothe distinction between the sensory (aestheton) and the non-sensory (noeton). It culminates in meaninglessness. It remains,nevertheless, the unthought and invincible presupposition of itsown blind attempts to extricate itself from meaninglessnessthrough a mere assigning of sense and meaning.

In what follows, metaphysics is thought as the truth of whatis as such in its entirety, and not as the doctrine of any particularthinker. Each thinker has at any given time his fundamentalphilosophical position within metaphysics. Therefore a par-ticular metaphysics can be called by his name. However, accord-ing to what is here thought as the essence of metaphysics, thatdoes not mean in any way that metaphysics at any given time isthe accomplishment and possession of the thinker as a person-ality within the public framework of creative cultural activity. Inevery phase of metaphysics there has been visible at any par-ticular time a portion of a way that the destining of Beingprepares as a path for itself over and beyond whatever is, insudden epochs of truth.3 Nietzsche himself interprets the courseof Western history metaphysically, and indeed as the rise anddevelopment of nihilism. The thinking through of Nietzsche\'smetaphysics becomes a reflection on the situation and place ofcontemporary man, whose destiny is still but little experiencedwith respect to its truth. Every reflection of such a kind, how-ever, if it is not simply an empty, repetitious reporting, remainsout beyond what usually passes for reflection.4 Its going beyondis not merely a surmounting and is not at all a surpassing; more-over, it is not an immediate overcoming. The fact that we arereflecting on Nietzsche\'s metaphysics does not mean that, inaddition to considering his ethics and his epistemology and hisaesthetics, we are also and above all taking note of his meta-physics; rather it means simply that we are trying to take

The Word of Nietzsche 55

Nietzsche seriously as a thinker. But also, to think means thisfor Nietzsche: to represent what is as what is. Any metaphysicalthinking is onto-logy or it is nothing at all.5

For the reflection we are attempting here, it is a question ofpreparing for a simple and inconspicuous step in thought. Whatmatters to preparatory thinking is to light up that space withinwhich Being itself might again be able to take man, with respectto his essence, into a primal relationship. To be preparatory isthe essence of such thinking.

That thinking, which is essential and which is therefore every-where and in every respect preparatory, proceeds in an unpre-tentious way. Here all sharing in thinking, clumsy and gropingthough it may be, is an essential help. Sharing in thinking provesto be an unobtrusive sowing---a sowing that cannot be authen-ticated through the prestige or utility attaching to it---by sowerswho may perhaps never see blade and fruit and may never knowa harvest. They serve the sowing, and even before that theyserve its preparation.

Before the sowing comes the plowing. It is a matter of makingthe field capable of cultivation, the field that through the un-avoidable predominance of the land of metaphysics has had toremain in the unknown. It is a matter first of having a presenti-ment of, then of finding, and then of cultivating, that field. Itis a matter of taking a first walk to that field. Many are the ways,still unknown, that lead there. Yet always to each thinker thereis assigned but one way, his own, upon whose traces he mustagain and again go back and forth that finally he may holdto it as the one that is his own---although it never belongs tohim---and may tell what can be experienced on that one way.

Perhaps the title Being and Time is a road marker belonging

5\. The word \"onto-logy\" is built from the Greek present participle ontos(being). Ontos is paralleled by Heidegger\'s use of the German presentparticiple das Seiende employed as a noun, literally, being, i.e., what is,what has or is in being. The meaning of \"what is\" can extend from \"abeing\" to the most inclusive encompassing of whatever is as such, in itsentirety. For Heidegger connotations of inclusiveness regularly predominate.Das Seiende stands always in reciprocal and mutually determinative rela-tion to das Sein, the German infinitive translated \"Being.\" On this relation,see \"The Onto-theo-logical Constitution of Metaphysics,\" in Identity andDifference, trans. Joan Stambaugh (New York: Harper & Row, 1969), pp.64, 132.

56 The Question Concerning Technology

to such a way. In accordance with the essential interwovennessof metaphysics with the sciences, which are counted amongmetaphysics\' own offspring---an interwovenness demanded bymetaphysics itself and forever sought anew---preparatory think-ing must move from time to time in the sphere of the sciences;for the sciences, in manifold ways, always claim to give thefundamental form of knowing and of the knowable, in advance,whether deliberately or through the kind of currency and effec-tiveness that they themselves possess. The more unequivocallythe sciences press on toward their predetermined technologicalessence and its distinctive character, the more decisively doesthe question concerning the possibility of knowledge laid claimto in technology clarify itself---the question concerning the kindand limits of that possibility and concerning its title to Tightness.

An education in thinking in the midst of the sciences is partof preparatory thinking and its fulfillment. To find the suitableform for this, so that such education in thinking does not fallvictim to a confusion with research and erudition, is the hardthing. This objective is in danger, then, above all when thinkingis simultaneously and continually under the obligation of firstfinding its own abode. To think in the midst of the sciencesmeans to pass near them without disdaining them.

We do not know what possibilities the destining of Westernhistory holds in store for our people and the West. Moreover,the external shaping and ordering of those possibilities is notprimarily what is needed. It is important only that learners inthinking should share in learning and, at the same time, sharingin teaching after their manner, should remain on the way andbe there at the right moment.

The following exposition confines itself in its aim and scope tothe sphere of the one experience from out of which Being andTime is thought. That thinking is concerned unceasingly withone single happening: In the history of Western thinking, indeedcontinually from the beginning, what is, is thought in referenceto Being; yet the truth of Being remains unthought, and not onlyis that truth denied to thinking as a possible experience, butWestern thinking itself, and indeed in the form of metaphysics,expressly, but nevertheless unknowingly, veils the happening ofthat denial.

The Word of Nietzsche 57

Preparatory thinking therefore maintains itself necessarilywithin the realm of historical reflection. For this thinking, historyis not the succession of eras, but a unique nearness of the Same6that, in incalculable modes of destining and out of changingimmediacy, approaches and concerns thinking.

What is important to us now is the reflection pertaining toNietzsche\'s metaphysics. Nietzsche\'s thinking sees itself as be-longing under the heading \"nihilism.\" That is the name for ahistorical movement, recognized by Nietzsche, already rulingthroughout preceding centuries, and now determining this cen-tury. Nietzsche sums up his interpretation of it in the briefstatement: \"God is dead/\'

One could suppose that the pronouncement \"God is dead\"expresses an opinion of Nietzsche the atheist and is accordinglyonly a personal attitude, and therefore one-sided, and for thatreason also easily refutable through the observation that todayeverywhere many men seek out the houses of God and endurehardships out of a trust in God as defined by Christianity. Butthe question remains whether the aforesaid word of Nietzscheis merely an extravagant view of a thinker about whom thecorrect assertion is readily at hand: he finally went mad. Andit remains to ask whether Nietzsche does not rather pronouncehere the word that always, within the metaphysically determinedhistory of the West, is already being spoken by implication.Before taking any position too hastily, we must first try to thinkthis pronouncement, \"God is dead,\" in the way in which it is

6\. For Heidegger the \"Same\" is a unity that---far from being abstract andsimple---is rather a together that involves a reciprocal relation of belonging.That unity of belonging together springs out of the disclosing bringing-into-its-own (Ereignis) that is the unique bringing-to-pass that takes placewithin Being itself (cf. T 45 ff.). It holds sway in the primal relatings ofBeing and what is, and of Being and man. Thus the Same is that very dif-ference, that separating-between (Unter-Schied), out of which Being andwhat is endure as present in their differentiating, which is an indissolublerelating. And again, \"thinking and Being belong together into the Sameand from out of the Same.\" (See \"The Principle of Identity,\" in Identity andDifference, pp. 27 ff., 90 ff.) Thus the Same of which Heidegger here speaksis the Same in the sense of the belonging together that rules in the modesof the destining of the Being of what is, and that concerns a thinking thatapprehends that Being as determined out of that unity which gives distinc-tiveness while uniting. (See \"The Onto-theo-logical Constitution of Meta-physics,\" in Identity and Difference, pp. 64 ff., 133 ff.)

58 The Question Concerning Technology

intended. To that end, therefore, we would do well to put asideall premature opinions that immediately obtrude for us at thisdreadful word.

The following reflections attempt to elucidate Nietzsche\'s pro-nouncement in a few essential respects. Once again let it beemphasized: The word of Nietzsche speaks of the destining oftwo millennia of Western history. We ourselves, unprepared aswe are, all of us together, must not suppose that through a lec-ture on the word of Nietzsche we can alter this destining or evensimply learn to know it adequately. Even so, this one thing isnow necessary: that out of reflection we receive instruction, andthat on the way of instruction we learn to reflect.

Every exposition must of course not only draw upon the sub-stance of the text; it must also, without presuming, imperceptiblygive to the text something out of its own substance. This partthat is added is what the layman, judging on the basis of whathe holds to be the content of the text, constantly perceives asa meaning read in, and with the right that he claims for himselfcriticizes as an arbitrary imposition. Still, while a right eluci-dation never understands the text better than the author under-stood it, it does surely understand it differently. Yet this dif-ference must be of such a kind as to touch upon the Same towardwhich the elucidated text is thinking.

Nietzsche spoke the word \"God is dead\" for the first time inthe third book of his work The Gay Science, which appearedin the year 1882. With that work begins Nietzsche\'s way towardthe development of his fundamental metaphysical position. Be-tween it and his vain efforts at shaping his proposed masterpiecelies the publication of Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The proposedmasterpiece was never completed. Tentatively it was to bear thetitle \"The Will to Power\" and to receive the subtitle \"Attemptat a Revaluation of All Values.\"

The strange notion of the death of a god and the dying of thegods was already familiar to the younger Nietzsche. In a notefrom the time of the completion of his first work, The Birth ofTragedy, Nietzsche writes (1870): \"I believe in the ancient Ger-man saying: \'All gods must die.\' \" The young Hegel, at the endof his treatise Faith and Knowledge (1802), names the \"feelingon which rests the religion of the modern period---the feeling

The Word of Nietzsche 59

God himself is dead. . . . \" Hegel\'s pronouncement carries athought different from that contained in the word of Nietzsche.Still, there exists between the two an essential connection thatconceals itself in the essence of all metaphysics. The word ofPascal, taken from Plutarch, \"Le grand Pan est mort\" \[\"GreatPan is dead\"\] (Pensees, 694), belongs within the same realm,even if for contrary reasons.

Let us listen, to begin with, to the full text of section no. 125,from the work The Cay Science. The piece is entitled \'The Mad-man\" and runs:

The Madman. Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lanternin the bright morning hours, ran to the market place, and cried in-cessantly, \"I seek God! I seek God!\" As many of those who donot believe in God were standing around just then, he provokedmuch laughter. Why, did he get lost? said one. Did he lose his waylike a child? said another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Hashe gone on a voyage? or emigrated? Thus they yelled and laughed.The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with hisglances.

\"Whither is God\" he cried. \"I shall tell you. We have killed him---you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how have we done this?How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge towipe away the entire horizon? What did we do when we unchainedthis earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are wemoving now? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually?Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there any up ordown left? Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing? Dowe not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder?Is not night and more night coming on all the while? Must notlanterns be lit in the morning? Do we not hear anything yet of thenoise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we not smellanything yet of God\'s decomposition? Gods too decompose. God isdead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we,the murderers of all murderers, comfort ourselves? What was holiestand most powerful of all that the world has yet owned has bled todeath under our knives. Who will wipe this blood off us? Whatwater is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atone-ment, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the great-ness of this deed too great for us? Must not we ourselves becomegods simply to seem worthy of it? There has never been a greater

60 The Question Concerning Technology

deed; and whoever will be born after us---for the sake of this deedhe will be part of a higher history than all history hitherto.\"

Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners;and they too were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At lasthe threw hi., lantern on the ground, and it broke and went out.\"I come too early/\' he said then; \"my time has not come yet. Thistremendous event is still on its way, still wandering---it has not yetreached the ears of man. Lightning and thunder require time, thelight of the stars requires time, deeds require time even after theyare done, before they can be seen and heard. This deed is still moredistant from them than the most distant stars---and yet they havedone it themselves.\"

It has been related further that on that same day the madmanentered divers churches and there sang his requiem aeternam deo.Led out and called to account, he is said to have replied each time,\"What are these churches now if they are not the tombs andsepulchers of God?\"7

Four years later (1886) Nietzsche added to the four books ofThe Gay Science a fifth, which is entitled \"We Fearless Ones.\"Over the first section in that book (Aphorism 343) is inscribed\"The Meaning of Our Cheerfulness.\" The piece begins, \"Thegreatest recent event---that \'God is dead/ that the belief in theChristian god has become unbelievable---is already beginning tocast its first shadows over Europe.\"

From this sentence it is clear that Nietzsche\'s pronouncement

concerning the death of God means the Christian god. But it isno less certain, and it is to be considered in advance, that theterms \"God\" and \"Christian god\" in Nietzsche\'s thinking areused to designate the suprasensory world in general. God isthe name for the realm of Ideas and ideals. This realm of thesuprasensory has been considered since Plato, or more strictlyspeaking, since the late Greek and Christian interpretation ofPlatonic philosophy, to be the true and genuinely real world.In contrast to it the sensory world is only the world down here,the changeable, and therefore the merely apparent, unreal world.The world down here is the vale of tears in contrast to the moun-tain of everlasting bliss in the beyond. If, as still happens inKant, we name the sensory world the physical in the broadersense, then the suprasensory world is the metaphysical world.

The pronouncement \"God is dead\" means: The suprasensoryworld is without effective power. It bestows no life. Metaphysics,i.e., for Nietzsche Western philosophy understood as Platonism,is at an end. Nietzsche understands his own philosophy as thecountermovement to metaphysics, and that means for him amovement in opposition to Platonism.

Nevertheless, as a mere countermovement it necessarily re-mains, as does everything \"anti,\" held fast in the essence of thatover against which it moves. Nietzsche\'s countermovementagainst metaphysics is, as the mere turning upside down ofmetaphysics, an inextricable entanglement in metaphysics, insuch a way, indeed, that metaphysics is cut off from its essenceand, as metaphysics, is never able to think its own essence.Therefore, what actually happens in metaphysics and as meta-physics itself remains hidden by metaphysics and for meta-physics.

If God as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality isdead, if the suprasensory world of the Ideas has suffered theloss of its obligatory and above all its vitalizing and upbuildingpower, then nothing more remains to which man can cling andby which he can orient himself. That is why in the passage justcited there stands this question: \"Are we not straying as throughan infinite nothing?\" The pronouncement \"God is dead\" con-tains the confirmation that this Nothing is spreading out.\"Nothing\" means here: absence of a suprasensory, obligatory

62 The Question Concerning Technology

world. Nihilism, \"the most uncanny of all guests,\" is standingat the door.

The attempt to elucidate Nietzsche\'s word \"God is dead\" hasthe same significance as does the task of setting forth whatNietzsche understands by \"nihilism\" and of thus showing howNietzsche himself stands in relation to nihilism. Yet, becausethis name is often used only as a catchword and slogan andfrequently also as an invective intended to prejudice, it is neces-sary to know what it means. Not everyone who appeals to hisChristian faith or to some metaphysical conviction or other standson that account definitely outside nihilism. Conversely also,however, not everyone who troubles himself with thoughts aboutNothing and its essence is a nihilist.

This name is readily used in such a tone as would indicatethat the mere designation \"nihilist,\" without one\'s even thinkingto oneself anything specific in the word, already suffices to pro-vide proof that a reflection on Nothing inevitably leads to aplunge into Nothing and means the establishment of the dicta-torship of Nothing.

Actually, we should be asking whether the name \"nihilism,\"thought strictly in the sense of Nietzsche\'s philosophy, has onlya nihilistic, i.e., a negative, meaning, one that floats off into thevoid of nothingness. Given the vague and arbitrary use of theword \"nihilism,\" it is surely necessary, before a thorough dis-cussion of what Nietzsche himself says about nihilism, to gainthe right perspective from which we may first begin to questionconcerning nihilism.

Nihilism is a historical movement, and not just any view ordoctrine advocated by someone or other. Nihilism moves historyafter the manner of a fundamental ongoing event that is scarcelyrecognized in the destining of the Western peoples. Hence nihil-ism is also not simply one historical phenomenon among others---not simply one intellectual current that, along with others, withChristendom, with humanism, and with the Enlightenment---also comes to the fore within Western history.

Nihilism, thought in its essence, is, rather, the fundamentalmovement of the history of the West. It shows such great pro-fundity that its unfolding can have nothing but world catastro-phes as its consequence. Nihilism is the world-historical move-

The Word of Nietzsche 63

ment of the peoples of the earth who have been drawn into thepower realm of the modern age. Hence it is not only a phe-nomenon of the present age, nor is it primarily the product ofthe nineteenth century, in which to be sure a perspicacious eyefor nihilism awoke and the name also became current. No moreis nihilism the exclusive product of particular nations whosethinkers and writers speak expressly of it. Those who fancythemselves free of nihilism perhaps push forward its develop-ment most fundamentally. It belongs to the uncanniness of thisuncanny guest that i\^ cannot name its own origin.

Nihilism also does not rule primarily where the Christian godis disavowed or where Christianity is combated; nor does it ruleexclusively where common atheism is preached in a secular set-ting. So long as we confine ourselves to looking only at thisunbelief turned aside from Christianity, and at the forms inwhich it appears, our gaze remains fixed merely on the externaland paltry facades of nihilism. The speech of the madman saysspecifically that the word \"God is dead\" has nothing in commonwith the opinions of those who are merely standing about andtalking confusedly, who \"do not believe in God.\" For those whoare merely believers in that way, nihilism has not yet asserteditself at all as the destining of their own history.

So long as we understand the word \"God is dead\" only as aformula of unbelief, we are thinking it theologically in the man-ner of apologetics, and we are renouncing all claims to whatmatters to Nietzsche, i.e., to the reflection that ponders what hasalready happened regarding the truth of the suprasensory worldand regarding its relation to man\'s essence.

Hence, also, nihilism in Nietzsche\'s sense in no way coincideswith the situation conceived merely negatively, that the Chris-tian god of biblical revelation can no longer be believed in, justas Nietzsche does not consider the Christian life that existedonce for a short time before the writing down of the Gospelsand before the missionary propaganda of Paul to belong toChristendom. Christendom for Nietzsche is the historical, world-political phenomenon of the Church and its claim to powerwithin the shaping of Western humanity and its modern culture.Christendom in this sense and the Christianity of New Testa-ment faith are not the same. Even a non-Christian life can affirm

64 The Question Concerning Technology

Christendom and use it as a means of power, just as, conversely,a Christian life does not necessarily require Christendom. There-fore, a confrontation with Christendom is absolutely not in anyway an attack against what is Christian, any more than a critiqueof theology is necessarily a critique of faith, whose interpreta-tion theology is said to be. We move in the flatlands of theconflicts between world views so long as we disregard theseessential distinctions.

In the word \"God is dead\" the name \"God,\" thought essen-tially, stands for the suprasensory world of those ideals whichcontain the goal that exists beyond earthly life for that lifeand that, accordingly, determines life from above, and also ina certain way, from without. But now when unalloyed faith inGod, as determined through the Church, dwindles away, whenin particular the doctrine of faith, theology, in its role of servingas the normative explanation of that which is as a whole, iscurtailed and thrust aside, then the fundamental structuring,in keeping with which the fixing of goals, extending into thesuprasensory, rules sensory, earthly life, is in no way therebyshattered as well.

Into the position of the vanished authority of God and of theteaching office of the Church steps the authority of conscience,obtrudes the authority of reason. Against these the social instinctrises up. The flight from the world into the suprasensory isreplaced by historical progress. The otherworldly goal of ever-lasting bliss is transformed into the earthly happiness of thegreatest number. The careful maintenance of the cult of religionis relaxed through enthusiasm for the creating of a culture orthe spreading of civilization. Creativity, previously the uniqueproperty of the biblical god, becomes the distinctive mark ofhuman activity. Human creativity finally passes over into busi-ness enterprise.

Accordingly, that which must take the place of the suprasen-sory world will be variations on the Christian-ecclesiastical andtheological interpretation of the world, which took over itsschema of the ordo of the hierarchy of beings from the Jewish-Hellenistic world, and whose fundamental structure was estab-lished and given its ground through Plato at the beginning ofWestern metaphysics.

The Word of Nietzsche 65

The realm for the essence and the coming-to-pass of nihilismis metaphysics itself---provided always that we do not mean bythis name a doctrine, let alone only one particular discipline ofphilosophy, but that we think rather on the fundamental struc-turing of that which is, as a whole, insofar as that whole isdifferentiated into a sensory and a suprasensory world and theformer is supported and determined by the latter. Metaphysicsis history\'s open space wherein it becomes a destining that thesuprasensory world, the Ideas, God, the moral law, the authorityof reason, progress, the happiness of the greatest number, cul-ture, civilization, suffer the loss of their constructive force andbecome void. We name this decay in the essence of the supra-sensory its disessentializing \[Verwesung\].8 Unbelief in the senseof a falling away from the Christian doctrine of faith is, there-fore, never the essence and the ground, but always only a con-sequence, of nihilism; for it could be that Christendom itselfrepresents one consequence and bodying-forth of nihilism.

From here we are able also to recognize the last aberration towhich we remain exposed in comprehending and supposedlycombating nihilism. Because we do not experience nihilism as ahistorical movement that has already long endured, the groundof whose essence lies in metaphysics, we succumb to the ruinouspassion for holding phenomena that are already and simplyconsequences of nihilism for the latter itself, or we set forth theconsequences and effects as the causes of nihilism. In ourthoughtless accommodation to this way of representing matters,we have for decades now accustomed ourselves to cite thedominance of technology or the revolt of the masses as thecause of the historical condition of the age, and we tirelesslydissect the intellectual situation of the time in keeping with suchviews. But every analysis of man and his position in the midstof what is, however enlightened and ingenious it may be, remains

8\. The noun Verwesung in ordinary usage means decomposition, and thecorresponding verb verwesen means to perish or decay. Heidegger here usesVerwesung in a quite literal sense, to refer to that ongoing event of thedeposing of the suprasensory world in which the suprasensory loses itsessence. As this event takes place, culminating in Nietzsche\'s decisive workof the overturning of metaphysics, metaphysics, as the truth of what is assuch, becomes the very reverse of itself and enters into its own non-enduring.

66 The Question Concerning Technology

thoughtless, and engenders only the semblance of reflection solong as it fails to think on the place of habitation proper to man\'sessence and to experience that place in the truth of Being.

So long as we merely take the appearances of nihilism for ni-hilism itself, our taking of a position in relation to nihilismremains superficial. It is not one whit less futile when, out ofdissatisfaction with the world situation, or out of half-avoweddespair or moral indignation, or a believer\'s self-righteous su-periority, it assumes a certain defensive vehemence.

In contrast to this, it is important above all that we reflect.Therefore, let us now ask Nietzsche himself what he understandsby nihilism, and let us leave it open at first whether with thisunderstanding Nietzsche after all touches on or can touch nihil-ism\'s essence.

In a note from the year 1887 Nietzsche poses the question,\"What does nihilism mean?\" (Will to Power, Aph. 2). He an-swers: \"That the highest values are devaluing themselves.\"

This answer is underlined and is furnished with the explana-tory amplification: \"The aim is lacking; \'Why?\' finds no answer.\"

According to this note Nietzsche understands nihilism as anongoing historical event. He interprets that event as the devalu-ing of the highest values up to now. God, the suprasensory worldas the world that truly is and determines all, ideals and Ideas,the purposes and grounds that determine and support everythingthat is and human life in particular---all this is here representedas meaning the highest values. In conformity with the opinionthat is even now still current, we understand by this the true,the good, and the beautiful; the true, i.e., that which really is;the good, i.e., that upon which everything everywhere depends;the beautiful, i.e., the order and unity of that which is in itsentirety. And yet the highest values are already devaluing them-selves through the emerging of the insight that the ideal worldis not and is never to be realized within the real world. Theobligatory character of the highest values begins to totter. Thequestion arises: Of what avail are these highest values if theydo not simultaneously render secure the warrant and the waysand means for a realization of the goals posited in them?

If, however, we were to insist on understanding Nietzsche\'sdefinition of the essence of nihilism in so many words as the

The Word of Nietzsche 67

becoming valueless of the highest values, then we would havethat conception of the essence of nihilism that has meanwhile be-come current and whose currency is undoubtedly strengthenedthrough its being labeled \"nihilism\": to wit, that the devaluingof the highest values obviously means decay and ruin. Yet forNietzsche nihilism is not in any way simply a phenomenon ofdecay; rather nihilism is, as the fundamental event of Westernhistory, simultaneously and above all the intrinsic law of thathistory. For that reason, in his observations about nihilismNietzsche gives scant attention to depicting historiographicallythe ongoing movement of the event of the devaluing of the high-est values and to discovering definitively from this, throughcalculation, the downfall of the West; rather Nietzsche thinksnihilism as the \"inner logic\" of Western history.

With this, Nietzsche recognizes that despite the devaluing forthe world of the highest values hitherto, the world itself remains;and he recognizes that, above all, the world, become value-less,presses inevitably on toward a new positing of values. After theformer values have become untenable, the new positing of valueschanges, in respect to those former values, into a \"revaluing ofall values.\" The no to the values hitherto comes out of a yes tothe new positing of values. Because in this yes, according toNietzsche\'s view, there is no accommodation to or compromisewith the former values, the absolute no belongs within this yesto the new value-positing. In order to secure the unconditionalityof the new yes against falling back toward the previous values,i.e., in order to provide a foundation for the new positing ofvalues as a countermovement, Nietzsche even designates thenew positing of values as \"nihilism/\' namely, as that nihilismthrough which the devaluing to a new positing of values that isalone definitive completes and consummates itself. This defini-tive phase of nihilism Nietzsche calls \"completed,\" i.e., classical,nihilism. Nietzsche understands by nihilism the devaluing ofthe highest values up to now. But at the same time he takes anaffirmative stand toward nihilism in the sense of a \"revaluingof all previous values.\" Hence the name \"nihilism\" remainsambiguous, and seen in terms of its two extremes, always hasfirst of all a double meaning, inasmuch as, on the one hand, itdesignates the mere devaluing of the highest values up to now,

68 The Question Concerning Technology

but on the other hand it also means at the same time the un-conditional countermovement to devaluing. Pessimism, whichNietzsche sees as the prefiguration of nihilism, is already two-fold also, in the same sense. According to Schopenhauer, pessi-mism is the belief that in this worst of worlds life is not worthbeing lived and affirmed. According to this doctrine, life, andthat means at the same time all existence as such, is to be denied.This pessimism is, according to Nietzsche, the \"pessimism ofweakness/\' It sees everywhere only gloom, finds in everythinga ground for failure, and claims to know how everything willturn out, in the sense of a thoroughgoing disaster. Over againstthis, the pessimism of strength as strength is under no illusion,perceives what is dangerous, wants no covering up and glossingover. It sees to the heart of the ominousness of mere impatientwaiting for the return of what has been heretofore. It penetratesanalytically into phenomena and demands consciousness of theconditions and forces that, despite everything, guarantee masteryover the historical situation.

A more essential reflection could show how in what Nietzschecalls the pessimism of strength there is accomplished the risingup of modern humanity into the unconditional dominion of sub-jectivity within the subjectness of what is.9 Through pessimism

9\. \"Subjectness\" translates Subjektitat, a word formed by Heidegger torefer to a mode of Being\'s coming to presence in its reciprocal interrelationwith what is, namely, that mode wherein Being manifests itself in respectto what is, appearing as subject, as subiectum, as hypokeimenon (that whichlies before). As such, subjectness has ruled from ancient times, while yetit has changed with the change in the destining of Being that took place atthe beginning of the modern age and has reached consummation, throughNietzsche\'s metaphysics, in the subjectness of the will to power. In likemanner, throughout Western history what is has been appearing as subject,though with a transformation corresponding to that change in the destiningof Being. What is appeared as the hypokeimenon for the Greeks. Subse-quently, the character of the hypokeimenon was transformed into the self-conscious, self-assertive subject, which, in its subjectivity, holds sway in ourage. Heidegger writes elsewhere that the name \"subjectness\" \"should em-phasize the fact that Being is determined in terms of the subiectum, butnot necessarily by an ego.\" Subjectness \"names the unified history of Being,beginning with the essential character of Being as idea up to the completionof the modern essence of Being as the will to power.\" {The End of Philoso-phy, trans. Joan Stambaugh \[New York: Harper & Row, 1973\], pp. 46, 48.Professor Stambaugh translates Subjektitat as \"subiectity.\") Later in thisessay (pp. 79 ff.), Heidegger will take up the discussion adumbrated in thissentence arid this word.

The Word of Nietzsche \' 69

in its twofold form, extremes become manifest. Those extremesas such maintain the ascendancy. There thus arises a situationin which everything is brought to a head in the absoluteness ofan \"either-or.\" An \"in-between situation\" comes to prevail inwhich it becomes evident that, on the one hand, the realizationof the highest values hitherto is not being accomplished. Theworld appears value-less. On the other hand, through this mak-ing conscious, the inquiring gaze is directed toward the sourceof the new positing of values, but without the world\'s regainingits value at all in the process.

To be sure, something else can still be attempted in face ofthe tottering of the dominion of prior values. That is, if God inthe sense of the Christian god has disappeared from his au-thoritative position in the suprasensory world, then this authori-tative place itself is still always preserved, even though as thatwhich has become empty. The now-empty authoritative realmof the suprasensory and the ideal world can still be adhered to.What is more, the empty place demands to be occupied anewand to have the god now vanished from it replaced by some-thing else. New ideals are set up. That happens, according toNietzsche\'s conception (Will to Power, Aph. 1021,1887), throughdoctrines regarding world happiness, through socialism, andequally through Wagnerian music, i.e., everywhere where \"dog-matic Christendom\" has \"become bankrupt.\" Thus does \"incom-plete nihilism\" come to prevail. Nietzsche says about the latter:\"Incomplete nihilism: its forms: we live in the midst of it.Attempts to escape nihilism without revaluing our values so far:they produce the opposite, make the problem more acute\" (Willto Power, Aph. 28,1887).

We can grasp Nietzsche\'s thoughts on incomplete nihilismmore explicitly and exactly by saying: Incomplete nihilism doesindeed replace the former values with others, but it still positsthe latter always in the old position of authority that is, as itwere, gratuitously maintained as the ideal realm of the supra-sensory. Completed nihilism, however, must in addition do awayeven with the place of value itself, with the suprasensory as arealm, and accordingly must posit and revalue values differently.

From this it becomes clear that the \"revaluing of all previousvalues\" does indeed belong to complete, consummated, and

70 The Question Concerning Technology

therefore classical nihilism, but the revaluing does not merelyreplace the old values with new. Revaluing becomes the over-turning of the nature and manner of valuing. The positing ofvalues requires a new principle, i.e., a new principle from whichit may proceed and within which it may maintain itself. Thepositing of values requires another realm. The principle can nolonger be the world of the suprasensory become lifeless. There-fore nihilism, aiming at a revaluing understood in this way, willseek out what is most alive. Nihilism itself is thus transformedinto \"the ideal of superabundant life\" (Will to Power, Aph. 14,1887). In this new highest value there is concealed another ap-praisal of life, i.e., of that wherein lies the determining essenceof everything living. Therefore it remains to ask what Nietzscheunderstands by life.

The allusion to the various levels and forms of nihilism showsthat nihilism according to Nietzsche\'s interpretation is, through-out, a history in which it is a question of values---the establishingof values, the devaluing of values, the revaluing of values; it is aquestion of the positing of values anew and, ultimately andintrinsically, a question of the positing of the principle of allvalue-positing---a positing that values differently. The highestpurposes, the grounds and principles of whatever is, ideals andthe suprasensory, God and the gods---all this is conceived inadvance as value. Hence we grasp Nietzsche\'s concept of nihilismadequately only when we know what Nietzsche understands byvalue. It is from here that we understand the pronouncement\"God is dead\" for the first time in the way in which it is thought.A sufficiently clear exposition of what Nietzsche thinks in theword \"value\" is the key to an understanding of his metaphysics.

It was in the nineteenth century that talk of values becamecurrent and thinking in terms of values became customary. Butonly after the dissemination of the writings of Nietzsche didtalk of values become popular. We speak of the values of life,of cultural values, of eternal values, of the hierarchy of values,of spiritual values, which we believe we find in the ancients,for example. Through scholarly preoccupation with philosophyend through the reconstructions of Neo-Kantianism, we arriveat value-philosophy. We build systems of values and pursue inethics classifications of values. Even in Christian theology we

The Word of Nietzsche 71

define God, the sum mum ens qua summum bonum, as the high-est value. We hold science to be value-free and relegate themaking of value judgments to the sphere of world views. Valueand the valuable become the positivistic substitute for the meta-physical. The frequency of talk about values is matched by acorresponding vagueness of the concept. This vagueness, for itspart, corresponds to the obscurity of the essential origin of valuefrom out of Being. For allowing that value, so often invoked insuch a way, is not nothing, it must surely have its essence inBeing.

What does Nietzsche understand by value? Wherein is theessence of value grounded? Why is Nietzsche\'s metaphysics themetaphysics of values?

Nietzsche says in a note (18S7-SS) what he understands byvalue: \'The point-of-view of \'value\' is the point-of-view con-stituting the preservation-enhancement conditions with respectto complex forms of relative duration of life within becoming\"(Will to Power, Aph. 715).10

The essence of value lies in its being a point-of-view. Valuemeans that upon which the eye is fixed. Value means that whichis in view for a seeing that aims at something or that, as we say,reckons upon something and therewith must reckon with some-thing else. Value stands in intimate relation to a so-much, toquantity and number. Hence values are related to a \"numericaland mensural scale\" (Will to Power, Aph. 710, 1888). The ques-tion still remains: Upon what is the scale of increase and de-crease, in its turn, grounded?

Through the characterization of value as a point-of-view thereresults the one consideration that is for Nietzsche\'s concept ofvalue essential: as a point-of-view, value is posited at any giventime by a seeing and for a seeing. This seeing is of such a kindthat it sees inasmuch as it has seen, and that it has seen inasmuchas it has set before itself and thus posited what is sighted, as a

10\. Italics Heidegger\'s. \"Point-of-view\" (Gesichtspunkt) is hyphenated inorder to differentiate it from its usual meaning, point of view as a subjec-tive opinion or standpoint. The latter meaning is present in Gesichtspunktas it is used here; but Heidegger stresses immediately that what is mainlyinvolved in valuing for Nietzsche is, rather, a focusing on the point that isin view.

72 The Question Concerning Technology

particular something. It is only through this positing which is arepresenting that the point that is necessary for directing thegaze toward something, and that in this way guides the path ofsight, becomes the aim in view---i.e., becomes that which mattersin all seeing and in all action guided by sight. Values, therefore,are not antecedently something in themselves so that they can onoccasion be taken as points-of-view.

Value is value inasmuch as it counts.11 It counts inasmuch asit is posited as that which matters. It is so posited through anaiming at and a looking toward that which has to be reckonedupon. A.im, view, field of vision, mean here both the sight beheldand seeing, in a sense that is determined from out of Greekthought, but that has undergone the change of idea from eidosto perceptio. Seeing is that representing which since Leibniz hasbeen grasped more explicitly in terms of its fundamental char-acteristic of striving (appetitus). All being whatever is a puttingforward or setting forth, inasmuch as there belongs to the Beingof whatever is in being the nisus---the impetus to come forward---that enjoins anything to arise (to appear) and thus determinesits coming forth. The essence of everything that is---an essencethus possessed of nisus---lays hold of itself in this way andposits for itself an aim in view. That aim provides the perspectivethat is to be conformed to. The aim in view is value.

According to Nietzsche, with values as points-of-view, \"pres-ervation-enhancement conditions\" are posited. Precisely throughthis way of writing, in which the \"and\" is omitted between\"preservation\" and \"enhancement\" and replaced with a hyphen,Nietzsche wants to make clear that values as points-of-view areessentially and therefore constantly and simultaneously condi-tions of preservation and enhancement. Where values are pos-ited, both ways of serving as conditions must be constantly keptin view in such a way that they remain unitively related to oneanother. Why? Obviously, simply because any being which, assuch, represents and strives, itself so is in its essence that itrequires these twofold aims in view. For what do values aspoints-of-view serve as conditions, if they must function simul-

The Word of Nietzsche 73

taneously as conditions of preservation as well as of enhance-ment?

Preservation and enhancement mark the fundamental tenden-cies of life, tendencies that belong intrinsically together. To theessence of life belongs the will to grow, enhancement. Everyinstance of life-preservation stands at the service of life-enhancement. Every life that restricts itself to mere preservationis already in decline. The guaranteeing of space in which to live,for example, is never the goal for whatever is alive, but is onlya means to life-enhancement. Conversely, life that is enhancedheightens in turn its prior need to expand its space. But nowhereis enhancement possible where a stable reserve is not alreadybeing preserved as secure, and in this way as capable of enhance-ment. Anything that is alive is therefore something that isbound together by the two fundamental tendencies of enhance-ment and preservation, i.e., a \"complex form of life/\' Values,as points-of-view, guide seeing \"with respect to complex forms.\"This seeing is at any given time a seeing on behalf of a view-to-life that rules completely in everything that lives. In that itposits the aims that are in view for whatever is alive, life, in itsessence, proves to be value-positing (cf. Will to Power, Aph.556, 1885-86).

\"Complex forms of life\" are oriented with reference to con-ditions of preserving and stabilizing, and indeed in such a waythat what is stable stands fast only in order to become, in en-hancement, what is unstable. The duration of these complexforms of life depends on the reciprocal relationship of enhance-ment and preservation. Hence duration is something compara-tive. It is always the \"relative duration\" of what is alive, i.e.,of life.

Value is, according to Nietzsche\'s words, the \"point-of-viewconstituting the preservation-enhancement conditions with re-spect to complex forms of relative duration of life within be-coming.\" Here and in the conceptual language of Nietzsche\'smetaphysics generally, the stark and indefinite word \"becom-ing\" does not mean some flowing together of all things or amere change of circumstances; nor does it mean just any devel-opment or unspecified unfolding. \"Becoming\" means the passingover from something to something, that moving and being moved

74 The Question Concerning Technology

which Leibniz calls in the Monadology (chap. 11) the change-merits naturels, which rule completely the ens qua ens, i.e., theens percipiens et appetens \[perceptive and appetitive being\].Nietzsche considers that which thus rules to be the fundamentalcharacteristic of everything real, i.e., of everything that is, inthe widest sense. He conceives as the \"will to power\" that whichthus determines in its essentia whatever is.

When Nietzsche concludes his characterization of the essenceof value with the word \"becoming,\" then this closing word givesthe clue to the fundamental realm within which alone valuesand value-positing properly belong. \"Becoming\" is, for Nietzsche,the \"will to power.\" The \"will to power\" is thus the fundamentalcharacteristic of \"life,\" which word Nietzsche often uses also inthe broad sense according to which, within metaphysics (cf.Hegel), it has been equated with \"becoming.\" \"Will to power,\"\"becoming,\" \"life,\" and \"Being\" in the broadest sense---thesemean, in Nietzsche\'s language, the Same (Will to Power, Aph.582, 1885-86, and Aph. 689, 1888). Within becoming, life---i.e.,aliveness---shapes itself into centers of the will to power par-ticularized in time. These centers are, accordingly, ruling con-figurations. Such Nietzsche understands art, the state, religion,science, society, to be. Therefore Nietzsche can also say: \"Valueis essentially the point-of-view for the increasing or decreasingof these dominating centers\" (that is, with regard to their rulingcharacter) (Will to Power, Aph. 715, 1887-88).

Inasmuch as Nietzsche, in the above-mentioned defining ofthe essence of value, understands value as the condition---havingthe character of point-of-view---of the preservation and enhance-ment of life, and also sees life grounded in becoming as the willto power, the will to power is revealed as that which positsthat point-of-view. The will to power is that which, out of its\"internal principle\" (Leibniz) as the nisus esse of the ens, judgesand esteems in terms of values. The will to power is the groundof the necessity of value-positing and of the origin of the possi-bility of value judgment. Thus Nietzsche says: \'\'Values andtheir changes are related to the increase in power of that whichposits them\" (Will to Power, Aph. 14, 1887).12

12\. Italics Heidegger\'s.

The Word of Nietzsche 75

Here it is clear: values are the conditions of itself posited bythe will to power. Only where the will to power, as the funda-mental characteristic of everything real, comes to appearance,i.e., becomes true, and accordingly is grasped as the reality ofeverything real, does it become evident from whence valuesoriginate and through what all assessing of value is supportedand directed. The principle of value-positing has now been rec-ognized. Henceforth value-positing becomes achievable \"in prin-ciple/7 i.e., from out of Being as the ground of whatever is.

Hence the will to power is, as this recognized, i.e., willed,principle, simultaneously the principle of a value-positing thatis new. It is new because for the first time it takes place con-sciously out of the knowledge of its principle. This value-positingis new because it itself makes secure to itself its principle andsimultaneously adheres to this securing as a value posited outof its own principle. As the principle of the new value-positing,however, the will to power is, in relation to previous values, atthe same time the principle of the revaluing of all such values.Yet, because the highest values hitherto ruled over the sensoryfrom the height of the suprasensory, and because the structur-ing of this dominance was metaphysics, with the positing of thenew principle of the revaluing of all values there takes place theoverturning of all metaphysics. Nietzsche holds this overturningof metaphysics to be the overcoming of metaphysics. But everyoverturning of this kind remains only a self-deluding entangle-ment in the Same that has become unknowable.

Inasmuch as Nietzsche understands nihilism as the intrinsiclaw of the history of the devaluing of the highest values hitherto,but explains that devaluing as a revaluing of all values, nihilismlies, according to Nietzsche\'s interpretation, in the dominanceand in the decay of values, and hence in the possibility of value-positing generally. Value-positing itself is grounded in the willto power. Therefore Nietzsche\'s concept of nihilism and thepronouncement \"God is dead\" can be thought adequately onlyfrom out of the essence of the will to power. Thus we will com-plete the last step in the clarifying of that pronouncement whenwe explain what Nietzsche thinks in the name coined by him,\"the will to power.\"

The name \"will to power\" is considered to be so obvious

76 The Question Concerning Technology

in meaning that it is beyond comprehension why anyone wouldbe at pains specifically to comment on this combination of words.For anyone can experience for himself at any time what \'\'will\"means. To will is to strive after something. Everyone todayknows, from everyday experience, what power means as theexercise of rule and authority. Will \"to\" power is, then, clearlythe striving to come into power.

According to this opinion the appellation \"will to power\" pre-supposes two disparate factors and puts them together into asubsequent relation, with \"willing\" on one side and \"power\" onthe other. If we ask, finally, concerning the ground of the willto power, not in order merely to express it in other words butalso simultaneously to explain it, then what we are shown is thatit obviously originates out of a feeling of lack, as a strivingafter that which is not yet a possession. Striving, the exerciseof authority, feeling of lack, are ways of conceiving and arestates (psychic capacities) that we comprehend through psycho-logical knowledge. Therefore the elucidation of the essence ofthe will to power belongs within psychology.

The view that has just been presented concerning the willto power and its comprehensibility is indeed enlightening, butit is a thinking that in every respect misses both what Nietzschethinks in the word \"will to power\" and the manner in which hethinks it. The name \"will to power\" is a fundamental term inthe fully developed philosophy of Nietzsche. Hence this philos-ophy can be called the metaphysics of the will to power. We willnever understand what \"will to power\" in Nietzsche\'s sensemeans with the aid of just any popular conception regardingwilling and power; rather we will understand only on the waythat is a reflection beyond metaphysical thinking, and that meansat the same time beyond the whole of the history of Westernmetaphysics.

The following elucidation of the essence of the will to powerthinks out of these contexts. But it must at the same time, evenwhile adhering to Nietzsche\'s own statements, also grasp thesemore clearly than Nietzsche himself could immediately utterthem. However, it is always only what already has become moremeaningful for us that becomes clearer to us. What is mean-ingful is that which draws closer to us in its essence. Everywhere

The Word of Nietzsche 77

here, in what has preceded and in what follows, everything isthought from out of the essence of metaphysics and not merelyfrom out of one of its phases.

In the second part of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which appearedthe year after the work The Gay Science (1883), Nietzsche forthe first time names the \"will to power\" in the context out ofwhich it must be understood: \"Where I found the living, thereI found will to power; and even in the will of those who serve Ifound the will to be master.\"

To will is to will-to-be-master. Will so understood is also evenin the will of him who serves. Not, to be sure, in the sense thatthe servant could aspire to leave his role of subordinate to be-come himself a master. Rather the subordinate us subordinate,the servant as servant, always wills to have something else underhim, which he commands in the midst of his own serving and ofwhich he makes use. Thus is he as subordinate yet a master.Even to be a slave is to will-to-be-master.

The will is not a desiring, and not a mere striving after some-thing, but rather, willing is in itself a commanding (cf. ThusSpoke Zarathustra, parts I and II; see also Will to Power, Aph.668\>, 1888). Commanding has its essence in the fact that themaster who commands has conscious disposal over the possi-bilities for effective action. What is commanded in the commandis the accomplishing of that disposal. In the command, the onewho commands (not only the one who executes) is obedient tothat disposing and to that being able to dispose, and in thatway obeys himself. Accordingly, the one who commands provessuperior to himself in that he ventures even his own self. Com-manding, which is to be sharply distinguished from the mereordering about of others, is self-conquest and is more difficultthan obeying. Will is gathering oneself together for the giventask. Only he who cannot obey himself must still be expresslycommanded. What the will wills it does not merely strive afteras something it does not yet have. What the will wills it hasalready. For the will wills its will. Its will is what it has willed.The will wills itself. It mounts beyond itself. Accordingly, thewill as will wills out beyond itself and must at the same timein that way bring itself behind itself and beneath itself. There-fore Nietzsche can say: \"To will at all is the same thing as to

will to become stronger, to will to grow . . . \" (Will to Power,Aph. 675, 1887-88).13 \"Stronger\" means here \"more power,\"and that means: only power. For the essence of power lies inbeing master over the level of power attained at any time. Poweris power only when and only so long as it remains power-enhancement and commands for itself \"more power.\" Even amere pause in power-enhancement, even a mere remaining at astandstill at a level of power, is already the beginning of thedecline of power. To the essence of power belongs the over-powering of itself. Such overpowering belongs to and springsfrom power itself, in that power is command and as commandempowers itself for the overpowering of its particular level ofpower at any given time. Thus power is indeed constantly onthe way to itself, but not as a will, ready at hand somewhere foritself, which, in the sense of a striving, seeks to come to power.Moreover, power does not merely empower itself for the over-powering of its level of power at any given time, for the sake ofreaching the next level; but rather it empowers itself for thisreason alone: to attain power over itself in the unconditionalitybelonging to its essence. Willing is, according to this defining ofits essence, so little a striving that, rather, all striving is onlya vestigial or an embryonic form of willing.

In the name \"will to power\" the word \"power\" connotesnothing less than the essence of the way in which the will willsitself inasmuch as it is a commanding. As a commanding thewill unites itself to itself, i.e., it unites itself to what it wills. Thisgathering itself together is itself power\'s assertion of power. Willfor itself does not exist any more than does power for itself.Hence, also, will and power are, in the will to power, not merelylinked together; but rather the will, as the will to will,14 is itselfthe will to power in the sense of the empowering to power. Butpower has its essence in the fact that it stands to the will as thewill standing within that will. The will to power is the essence

of power. It manifests the unconditional essence of the will,which as pure will wills itself.

Hence the will to power also cannot be cast aside in exchangefor the will to something else, e.g., for the \"will to Nothing\";for this latter will also is still the will to will, so that Nietzschecan say, \"It (the will) will rather will Nothing, than not will\"(Genealogy of Morals, 3, Section I, 1887).15

\"Willing Nothing\" does not in the least mean willing the mereabsence of everything real; rather it means precisely willing thereal, yet willing the latter always and everywhere as a nullityand, through this, willing only annihilation. In such willing,power always further secures to itself the possibility of commandand the ability-to-be-master.

The essence of the will to power is, as the essence of will, thefundamental trait of everything real. Nietzsche says: The willto power is \"the innermost essence of Being\" (Will to Power,Aph. 693, 1888). \"Being\" means here, in keeping with the lan-guage of metaphysics, that which is as a whole. The essence ofthe will to power and the will to power itself, as the fundamentalcharacter of whatever is, therefore cannot be identified throughpsychological observations; but on the contrary psychology itselffirst receives its essence, i.e., the positability and knowabilityof its object, through the will to power. Hence Nietzsche doesnot understand the will to power psychologically, but rather,conversely, he defines psychology anew as the \"morphology andthe doctrine of the development of the will to power\" (BeyondGood and Evil, Aph. 23).ir\> Morphology is the ontology of onwhose morphe, transformed through the change of eidos toperceptio, appears, in the appetitus of perceptio, as the will topower. The fact that metaphysics---which from ancient timesthinks that which is, in respect to its Being, as the hypokeimenon,sub-iectum---is transformed into the psychology thus definedonly testifies, as a consequent phenomenon, to the essential event,which consists in a change in the beingness of what is. Theousia (beingness) of the subiectum changes into the subjectness

of self-assertive self-consciousness, which now manifests its es-sence as the will to will.17 The will is, as the will to power, thecommand to more power. In order that the will in its overpower-ing of itself may surpass its particular level at any given time,that level, once reached, must be made secure and held fast.The making secure of a particular level of power is the necessarycondition for the heightening of power. But this necessary con-dition is not sufficient for the fact that the will is able to willitself, for the fact, that is, that a willing-to-be-stronger, an en-hancement of power, is. The will must cast its gaze into a fieldof vision and first open it up so that, from out of this, possi-bilities may first of all become apparent that will point the wayto an enhancement of power. The will must in this way posit acondition for a willing-out-beyond-itself. The will to powermust, above all, posit conditions for power-preservation andpower-enhancement. To the will belongs the positing of theseconditions that belong intrinsically together.

\"To will at all is the same thing as to will to become stronger,to will to grow---and, in addition, to will the means thereto\"(Will to Power, Aph. 675,1887-88).18

The essential means are the conditions of itself posited by thewill to power itself. These conditions Nietzsche calls values. Hesays, \"In all will there is valuing . . . \" (XIII, Aph. 395, 1884).10To value means to constitute and establish worth. The will topower values inasmuch as it constitutes the conditions of en-hancement and fixes the conditions of preservation. The will to

power is, in its essence, the value-positing will. Values are thepreservation-enhancement conditions within the Being of what-ever is. The will to power is, ,is soon as it comes expressly toappearance in its pure essence, itself the foundation and therealm of value-positing. The will to power does not have itsground in a feeling of lack; rather it itself is the ground ofsuperabundant life. Here life means the will to will. \"Living:that already means \'to ascribe worth7 \" (loc. cit.).

Inasmuch as the will wills the overpowering of itself, it is notsatisfied with any abundance of life. It asserts power in over-reaching---i.e., in the overreaching of its own will. In this wayit continually comes as the selfsame back upon itself as thesame.20 The way in which that which is, in its entirety---whoseessentia is the will to power---exists, i.e., its existentia, is \"theeternal returning of the same.\"21 The two fundamental terms of

20\. In this sentence both \"selfsame\" and \"same\" translate gleich (equal,equivalent, even, like). Subsequently in this discussion gleich will be trans-lated simply with \"same.\" \"Same\" and \"selfsame\" must here be taken tocarry the meaning of \"equivalence.\" They should not be understood toconnote sameness in the sense of simple identity, for they allude to anequivalence resident in the self-relating movement of what is intrinsicallyone. This latter meaning should be clearly distinguished from that of the\"Same,\" namely, the identity of belonging together, which is fundamentalfor Heidegger\'s own thinking. See p. 57 n. 6 above. Because of possibleconfusion, \"selfsame\" and \"same\" have been used here only with re-luctance, but none of the usual translations of gleich prove suitable for thephrasing of the translation.

21\. Nietzsche\'s phrase die ewige Wiederkunft des Gleichen, here trans-lated as \"the eternal returning of the same,\" is usually translated as \"theeternal recurrence (or return) of the same.\" The translation \"returning\" hasbeen chosen in accordance with the burden of Heidegger\'s present discus-sion of the will to power as turning back upon itself. The phrase might wellbe rendered here the \"perpetual returning of the selfsame.\"

The turning back of the will to power upon itself, that it may move for-ward as the will to power, has its correlate for Heidegger in the reflexivemovement characteristic of what is as such. \"The eternal returning of thesame,\" as the existentia of the essentia, the will to power, is taken by Hei-degger to speak of that mode of Being of all that is which he elsewhere calls\"subiectness\" (Subjektitat). Just as the will to power, as the Being of whatis, simultaneously and necessarily turns back upon itself in going beyonditself; so, correspondingly, whatever is, in its Being, simultaneously andnecessarily goes out beyond itself while yet underlying itself, therebyperpetuating and securing itself. Thus, \"Everywhere the Being of whateveris lies in setting-itself-before-itself and thus in setting-itself-up\" (p. 100).This is that self-objectifying, self-establishing character of what is which

82 The Question Concerning Technology

Nietzsche\'s metaphysics, \"will to power\" and \"eternal returningof the same,\" define whatever is, in its Being---ens qua ens inthe sense of essentia and existentia---in accordance with the viewsthat have continually guided metaphysics from ancient times.

The essential relationship that is to be thought in this way,between the \"will to power\" and the \"eternal returning of thesame,\" cannot as yet be directly presented here, because meta-physics has neither thought upon nor even merely inquired afterthe origin of the distinction between essentia and existentia.

When metaphysics thinks whatever is, in its Being, as thewill to power, then it necessarily thinks it as value-positing. Itthinks everything within the sphere of values, of the authori-tative force of value, of devaluing and revaluing. The meta-physics of the modern age begins with and has its essence inthe fact that it seeks the unconditionally indubitable, the certainand assured \[das Cewisse\], certainty.22 It is a matter, accordingto the words of Descartes, of firmum et mansurum quid stabilire,of bringing to a stand something that is firmly fixed and thatremains. This standing established as object is adequate to the

is its character as \"representing\" and which corresponds to the will topower\'s simultaneously advancing to greater power and establishing areserve on the basis of which it can so advance.

22\. Gewiss (certain) and Gewisshp.it (certainty) are allied to the verbwissen (to know). Both words carry a strong connotation of sureness, firm-ness---the sureness of that which is known. During the discussion that hereensues, the connotations of sureness should always be felt in the words\"certain\" and \"certainty.\" In particular, \"certainty\" must never be taken torefer to some sort of merely intellectual certainty. For, as the discussionitself makes clear, the sure certainty here in question partakes of a beingsecure (n. 28 below). This note of \"secureness\" will here dominate Hei-degger\'s presentation at length, culminating in the discussion of \"justice\"(pp. 89 ff.), which, as here under consideration, involves \"making secure.\"The words \"knowing\" (wissen), \"self-knowing-itself\" (Sich-selbstwissen),\"gathering-of-knowing\" (Gc-wisscn \[normally Gcwissen, consciousness,conscience!), \"conscious\" (bewusst), and \"consciousness\" (Bewusstsein),which Heidegger will subsequently introduce here, all originate from thesame root wiss that is found in gewiss and Gewissheit, and must be seento lie closely within the sphere of meaning just pointed out for those words.

The most fundamental root meaning resident in wissen and its cognatesis that of seeing, and this meaning should here also be kept in view, for itdoubtless has a part in the meaning that Heidegger intends for truth---which is for him unconcealment---when he speaks of truth as certainty(Gewissheit) and of the true as the certain (das Gewisse) that is repre-sented, i.e., set before.

The Word of Nietzsche 83

essence, ruling from of old, of what is as the constantly presenc-ing, which everywhere already lies before (hypokeimenon, sub-iectum). Descartes also asks, as does Aristotle, concerning thehypokeimcnon. Inasmuch as Descartes seeks this subiectumalong the path previously marked out by metaphysics, he, think-ing truth as certainty, finds the ego cogito to be that which pres-ences as fixed and constant. In this way, the ego sum istransformed into the subiectum, i.e., the subject becomes self-consciousness. The subjectness of the subject is determined outof the sureness, the certainty, of that consciousness.

The will to power, in that it posits the preservation, i.e., thesecuring, of its own constancy and stability as a necessary value,at the same time justifies the necessity of such securing in every-thing that is which, as something that by virtue of its veryessence represents---sets in place before---is something thatalso always holds-to-be-true. The making secure that constitutesthis holding-to-be-true is called certainty. Thus, according toNietzsche\'s judgment, certainty as the principle of modern meta-physics is grounded, as regards its truth, solely in the will topower, provided of course that truth is a necessary value andcertainty is the modern form of truth. This makes clear in whatrespect the modern metaphysics of subjectness is consummatedin Nietzsche\'s doctrine of the will to power as the \"essence\" ofeverything real.

Therefore Nietzsche can say: \"The question of value is morefundamental than the question of certainty: the latter becomesserious only by presupposing that the value question has alreadybeen answered\" (Will to Power, Aph. 588, 1887-88).

However, when once the will to power is recognized as theprinciple of value-positing, the inquiry into value must immedi-ately ponder what the highest value is that necessarily followsfrom this principle and that is in conformity with it. Inasmuchas the essence of value proves itself to be the preservation-enhancement condition posited in the will to power, the perspec-tive for a characterization of the normative structuring of valuehas been opened up.

The preservation of the level of power belonging to the willreached at any given time consists in the will\'s surroundingitself with an encircling sphere of that which it can reliably

84 The Question Concerning Technology

grasp at, each time, as something behind itself, in order on thebasis of it to contend for its own security. That encircling spherebounds off the constant reserve of what presences (ousia, in theeveryday meaning of this term for the Greeks) that is immedi-ately at the disposal of the will.23 This that is steadily constant,however, is transformed into the fixedly constant, i.e., becomesthat which stands steadily at something\'s disposal, only in beingbrought to a stand through a setting in place. That setting inplace has the character of a producing that sets before.-4 Thatwhich is steadily constant in this way is that which remains.True to the essence of Being (Being = enduring presence) hold-ing sway in the history of metaphysics, Nietzsche calls this thatis steadily constant \"that which is in being.\" Often he calls thatwhich is steadily constant---again remaining true to the mannerof speaking of metaphysical thinking---\"Being.\" Since the begin-ning of Western thinking, that which is has been considered tobe the true and truth, while yet, in connection with this, themeaning of \"being\" and \"true\" has changed in manifold ways.Despite all his overturnings and revaluings of metaphysics,Nietzsche remains in the unbroken line of the metaphysical tradi-tion when he calls that which is established and made fast in thewill to power for its own preservation purely and simply Being,or what is in being, or truth. Accordingly, truth is a conditionposited in the essence of the will to power, namely, the conditionof the preservation of power. Truth is, as this condition, a value.

23\. \"Constant reserve\" renders Bestand. Cf. QT 17. Bestand does nothere have the fuJIy developed meaning of the \"standing-reserve\" present inthat chronologically later essay, but does already approach it. \"The constantreserve of what presences,\" i.e., of what is as such, that the will to powerneeds for its own preservation and enhancement, becomes, when viewedwith regard to man as accepting and accomplishing the dominion of the willto power, that which must be made secure as available for man. Heideggerspeaks later in this essay of a making secure of \"the stably constant reserveof what is for a willing of the greatest possible uniformity and equality\"(p. 102); and the constant reserve is secured that it may be used as a secureresource for every aspect of man\'s life (p. 107). Here must lie close at handfor us the thought of the standing-reserve as the undifferentiated reserveof the available that is ready for use. In keeping with this, Heidegger\'sdiscussion of man under the dominion of the will to power has a closeparallel in his discussion of the rule of Enframing in the modern age. Cf.also p. 100 below, QT 19 ff.

24\. Dieses Stellen hat die Art des vor-stellenden Herstellens.

The Word of Nietzsche 85

But because the will can will only from out of its disposal oversomething steadily constant, truth is a necessary value preciselyfrom out of the essence of the will to power, for that will. Theword \"truth\" means now neither the unconcealment of what isin being, nor the agreement of a judgment with its object, norcertainty as the intuitive isolating and guaranteeing of what isrepresented. Truth is now, and indeed through an essentiallyhistorical origin out of the modes of its essence just mentioned,that which---making stably constant---makes secure the constantreserve, belonging to the sphere from out of which the will topower wills itself.

With respect to the making secure of the level of power thathas been reached at any given time, truth is the necessary value.But it does not suffice for the reaching of a level of power; forthat which is stably constant, taken alone, is never able to pro-vide what the will requires before everything else in order tomove out beyond itself, and that means to enter for the firsttime into the possibilities of command. These possibilities aregiven only through a penetrating forward look that belongs tothe essence of the will to power; for, as the will to more power,it is, in itself, perspectively directed toward possibilities. Theopening up and supplementing of such possibilities is that con-dition for the essence of the will to power which---as that whichin the literal sense goes before---overtops and extends beyondthe condition just mentioned. Therefore Nietzsche says: \"Buttruth does not count as the supreme standard of value, even lessas the supreme power\" (Will to Power, Aph. 853, 1887-88).

The creating of possibilities for the will on the basis of whichthe will to power first frees itself to itself is for Nietzsche theessence of art. In keeping with this metaphysical concept,Nietzsche does not think under the heading \"art\" solely or evenprimarily of the aesthetic realm of the artist. Art is the essenceof all willing that opens up perspectives and takes possession ofthem: \"The work of art, where it appears without an artist,e.g., as body, as organization (Prussian officer corps, JesuitOrder). To what extent the artist is only a preliminary stage.The world as a work of art that gives birth to itself\" (Will toPower, Aph. 796, 1885-86)rr\>

25\. Italics Heidegger\'s.

86 The Question Concerning Technology

The essence of art, understood from out of the will to power,consists in the fact that art excites the will to power first of alltoward itself \[i.e., toward the will\] and goads it on to willingout beyond itself. Because Nietzsche, in fading reminiscence ofthe zoe and physis of early Greek thinkers, often also calls thewill to power, as the reality of the real, life, he can say that artis \"the great stimulant of life\" (Will to Power, Aph. 851, 1888).

Art is the condition posited in the essence of the will to powerfor the will\'s being able, as the will that it is, to ascend to powerand to enhance that power. Because it conditions in this way,art is a value. As that condition which---in the hierarchy of theconditioning pertaining to the making secure of a constant re-serve---takes the lead and in that way precedes all conditioning,it is the value that first opens all heights of ascent. Art is thehighest value. In relation to the value truth, it is the highervalue. The one, ever in a fresh way, calls forth the other. Bothvalues determine in their value-relation the unitive essence ofthe intrinsically value-positing will to power. The will to poweris the reality of the real or, taking the word more broadly thanNietzsche usually is accustomed to using it: the Being of thatwhich is. If metaphysics must in its utterance exhibit that whichis, in respect to Being, and if therewith after its manner it namesthe ground of that which is, then the grounding principle of themetaphysics of the will to power must state this ground. Theprinciple declares what values are posited essentially and inwhat value hierarchy they are posited within the essence of thevalue-positing will to power as the //essence,/ \[Essenz\] of thatwhich is. The principle runs: \"Art is worth more than truth\'7(Will to Power, Aph. 853,1887-88).

The grounding principle of the metaphysics of the will topower is a value-principle.

It becomes clear from the highest value-principle that value-positing as such is essentially twofold. In it, whether expresslyarticulated or not, a necessary and a sufficient value are alwaysposited, although both are posited from out of the prevailingrelationship of the two to one another. This twofoldness ofvalue-positing corresponds to its principle. That from out ofwhich value-positing as such is supported and guided is thewill to power. From out of the unity of its essence it both craves

The Word of Nietzsche 87

and is sufficient for the conditions of the enhancement andpreservation of itself. The reference to the twofold essence ofvalue-positing brings thinking expressly before the question con-cerning the essential unity of the will to power. Inasmuch as thewill to power is the \"essence\" of that which is as such, whichmeans moreover that it is the true of metaphysics, we are askingconcerning the truth of this true when we ponder the essentialunity of the will to power. With that, we attain to the highestpoint of this and every metaphysics. But what does \"highestpoint\" mean here? We shall explain what we mean with refer-ence to the essence of the will to power, and shall thus remainwithin the bounds that have been drawn for this discussion.

The essential unity of the will to power can be nothing otherthan the will itself. This unity is the way in which the will topower, as will, brings itself before itself. It orders the willforth into the will\'s own testing and sets it before the latterin such a way that in such testing the will first represents \[repra-sentiert\] itself purely and therewith in its highest form. Here,representation \[Reprasentation\] is, however, in no way a pre-senting \[Darstellung\] that is supplementary; but rather the pres-ence \[Prasenz\] determined from out of that presenting is themode in which and as which the will to power is.

Yet this mode in which the will is, is at the same time themanner in which the will sets itself forth into the unconceal-ment-\<; of itself. And therein lies the will\'s truth. The questionconcerning the essential unity of the will to power is the questionconcerning the type of that truth in which the will to power isas the Being of whatever is. This truth, moreover, is at the sametime the truth of that which is as such, and it is as that truththat metaphysics is. The truth concerning which we are nowasking is accordingly not that truth which the will to power itselfposits as the necessary condition of that which is, as somethingin being; but rather it is the truth in which the condition-positingwill to power as such already comes to presence \[iwesf\]. This Onein which the will to power comes to presence, its essential unity,concerns the will to power itself.

26\. das Unverborgene. In this passage, Heidegger\'s central characteriza-tion of truth as unconcealment (Unvcrborgcnheit) must be kept in mind.

88 The Question Concerning Technology

But now of what type is this truth of the Being of whateveris? It can be defined only from out of that whose truth it is.However, inasmuch as within modern metaphysics the Beingof whatever is has determined itself as will and therewith asself-willing, and, moreover, self-willing is already inherently self-knowing-itself, therefore that which is, the hypokeimenon, thesubiectum, comes to presence in the mode of self-knowing-itself.That which is (subiectum) presents itself \[prasentiert sich\], andindeed presents itself to itself, in the mode of the ego cogito.This self-presenting, this re-presentation \[Re-prasentation\] (set-ting-before \[Vor-stellung\]), is the Being of that which is in beingqua subiectum. Self-knowing-itself is transformed into subjectpurely and simply. In self-knowing-itself, all knowing and whatis knowable for it gathers itself together. It is a gathering to-gether of knowing, as a mountain range is a gathering togetherof mountains. The subjectivity of the subject is, as such agathering together, co-agitatio (cogitatio), conscientia, a gather-ing of knowing \[Ge-wissen\], consciousness (conscience).27 Butthe co-agitatio is already, in itself, velle, willing. In the subject-ness of the subject, will comes to appearance as the essenceof subjectness. Modern metaphysics, as the metaphysics ofsubjectness, thinks the Being of that which is in the senseof will.

It belongs to subjectness, as the primary determination of itsessence, that the representing subject makes itself sure of itself---and that means makes itself sure continually also of what itrepresents---as a particular something. In accordance with sucha making sure, the truth of that which is, as certainty \[Gewiss-heit\], has its character of secureness \[Sicherheit\] (certitudo).28The self-knowing-itself, wherein is certainty as such, remains

for its part a derivative of the former essence of truth, namely,of the correctness (rectitudo) of a representing. However, nowthe correct no longer consists in an assimilation to somethingpresencing that is unthought in its presence. Correctness consistsnow in the arranging of everything that is to be represented,according to the standard that is posited in the claim to knowl-edge of the representing res cogitans sive mens \[thinking thingor mind\]. This claim moves toward the secureness that consistsin this, that everything to be represented and representing itselfare driven together into the clarity and lucidity of the mathe-matical idea and there assembled. The ens is the ens coagitatumperceptionis \[the being that is driven together and consists in per-ceiving\]. The representing is now correct when it is right in re-lation to this claim to secureness. Proved correct \[richtig\] inthis way, it is, as \"rightly dealt with\" \[recht gefertigt\] and asat our disposal, made right, justified \[gerecht-fertigt\].29 Thetruth of anything that is in being, in the sense of the self-certainty of subjectness, is, as secureness (certitudo), funda-mentally the making-right, the justifying, of representing andof what it represents before representing\'s own clarity. Justifica-tion (iustificatio) is the accomplishing of iustitia \[justice or Tight-ness\] and is thus justice \[Gerechtigkeit\] itself.30 Since the subject

29\. Note that Heidegger here brings together three words, all of whichare derived from the stem recht (right). By so doing, he is able implicitly toshow that much of the truth of his statement lies in the words themselves.The discussion that now ensues includes a variety of recht words that canbe translated accurately in English only by introducing the stem \"just.\"The full significance of this discussion can be appreciated only if we bearconstantly in mind the intimate relationship that these recht words haveto one another. Thus: richtig (correct), rechtfertigen and Rechtfertigung (tojustify; justification), Gerechtigkeit (justice, Tightness, or righteousness),Gerecht (right, just, righteous), das Rechte (the morally right).

30\. The English word \"justice\" carries strong connotations of an appor-tioning in an ethical or legal sense. Iustitia (justice), as used in medievaland Reformation theology, has a more ample meaning. It alludes to theentire Tightness of man\'s life and the Tightness of his relationship to God,i.e., his righteousness. Heidegger here points to the roots of the modernphilosophical understanding of justice in this theological tradition. TheGerman word Gerechtigkeit (justice or righteousness), because of the cen-trally formative influence exerted by Luther\'s translation of the Bible onthe modern German language, inevitably carries something of this theo-logical connotation, and the range of its meaning colors Heidegger\'s presentdiscussion.

is forever subject, it makes itself certain of its own secureness.It justifies itself before the claim to justice that it itself hasposited.

At the beginning of the modern age the question was freshlyraised as to how man, within the totality of what is, i.e., beforethat ground of everything in being which is itself most in being(God),31 can become certain and remain certain of his own surecontinuance, i.e., his salvation. This question of the certainty ofsalvation is the question of justification, i.e., of justice (iustitia).

Within modern metaphysics it is Leibniz who first thinks thesubiectum as ens percipiens et appetens \[the perceptive andappetitive being\]. He is the first to think clearly---in the vis-character \[force-character\] of the ens---the volitional essence ofthe Being of whatever is. In a modern manner he thinks thetruth of whatever is in being as sureness and certainty \[Gewiss-heit\]. In his Twenty-four Theses on Metaphysics, Leibniz says(Thesis 20): Iustitia nihil aliud est quam ordo seu perfectio circamentes?- The mentes, i.e., the res cogitantes \[thinking things\],are, according to Thesis 22, the primariae mundi unitates \[pri-mary units of the world\]. Truth as certainty is the making secureof secureness; it is order {ordo) and thoroughgoing establish-ment, i.e., full and utter completion (per-fectio). The makingsecure that characterizes that which primarily and genuinely is,in its Being, is iustitia (justice).

Kant, in his laying of the critical foundations of metaphysics,thinks the ultimate self-securing of transcendental subjectivity asthe quaestio iuris of the transcendental deduction. This is thelegal question of the making right, the justification, of the repre-senting subject, which has itself firmly fixed its essence in theself-justifiedness of its \"I think.\"33

In the essence of truth as certainty---certainty thought as the

32\. \"Justice is nothing but the order and perfection that obtains in respectto minds.\"

33\. \"Self-justifiedness\" is the translation of Selbst-Gerechtigkeit. Selbst-gerechtigkeit, without a hyphen, is always translated \"self-righteousness.\"By hyphenating it here, Heidegger lets it show what in the context of thisdiscussion might be called its more fundamental meaning of self-justified-ness.

The Word of Nietzsche 91

truth of subjectness, and subjectness thought as the Being ofwhatever is---is concealed justice, experienced in terms of thejustification having to do with secureness. Indeed, justice holdssway as the essence of the truth of subjectness, although in themetaphysics of subjectness justice is not thought as the truthof that which is. Yet, on the other hand, justice must in factconfront modern metaphysical thinking as the self-knowingBeing of everything in being as soon as the Being of whateveris appears as the will to power. The latter knows itself as thatwhich is essentially value-positing, as that which, in its positingof values as the conditions of the constant reserve belonging toits own essence, makes itself secure, and in that way perpetuallybecomes just and right to itself and in such becoming is justice.It is in justice and as justice that the unique essence of the willto power must represent \[reprasentieren\], and that means, whenthought according to modern metaphysics: be. Just as in Nietz-sche\'s metaphysics the idea of value is more fundamental thanthe grounding idea of certainty in the metaphysics of Descartes,inasmuch as certainty can count as the right only if it counts asthe highest value, so, in the age of the consummation of Westernmetaphysics in Nietzsche, the intuitive self-certainty of subject-ness proves to be the justification belonging to the will to power,in keeping with the justice holding sway in the Being of what-ever is.

Already in an earlier and more generally known work, thesecond Untimely Meditation, \"Of the Use and Disadvantage ofHistory\" (1874), Nietzsche substitutes \"justice\" for the objec-tivity of the historical sciences (fragment 6). But otherwiseNietzsche is silent on the subject of justice. Only in the decisiveyears 1884-85, when the \"will to power\" stands before his mind\'seye as the fundamental characteristic of whatever is in being,does he write down two ideas on justice without publishing them.

The first note (1884) bears the title: \"The Ways of Freedom.\"It reads: \"Justice, as building, separating, annihilating mode ofthinking, out of value-judgments; highest representative of lifeitself\' (XIII, Aph. 98).

The second note (1885) says: \"Justice, as function of a powerhaving a wide range of vision, which sees out beyond the narrow

92 The Question Concerning Technology

perspectives of good and evil, thus has a wider horizon of interest---the aim, to preserve Something that is more than this or thatparticular person\" (XIV, Aph. 158).34

A thorough exposition of these thoughts would extend beyondthe limits of the reflection being attempted here. An indicationof the essential sphere within which the justice that is thoughtby Nietzsche belongs will have to suffice. To prepare ourselvesfor an understanding of the justice that Nietzsche has in view,we must rid ourselves of those conceptions of justice that stemfrom Christian, humanistic, Enlightenment, bourgeois, and so-cialist morality. For Nietzsche does not at all understand justiceprimarily as it is defined in the ethical and juridical realms.Rather, he thinks it from out of the Being of what is as a whole,i.e., from out of the will to power. The just is that which is inconformity with the right. But what is right is determined fromout of that which, as whatever is, is in being. Thus Nietzschesays: \"Right = the will to eternalize a momentary power rela-tion. Satisfaction with that relation is its presupposition. Every-thing sacred is drawn toward it to let the right appear as eternal\"(XIII, Aph. 462, 1883).

With this belongs the note from the following year: \"Theproblem of justice. What is first and most powerful, of course, isprecisely the will to and the strength for suprapower. The rulerestablishes \'justice\' only afterward, i.e., he measures things ac-cording to his standard; if he is very powerful, he can go veryfar toward giving free rein to and recognizing the individual whotries\" (XIV, Aph. 181). Nietzsche\'s metaphysical concept ofjustice may well seem strange when compared with our familiarconception, and this is to be expected; yet for all that, it touchessquarely the essence of the justice that at the beginning of theconsummation of the modern age, amidst the struggle for masteryof the earth, is already historically true, and that therefore de-termines all human activity in this period, whether explicitlyor not, whether secretly or openly.

The justice thought by Nietzsche is the truth of what is---which now is in the mode of the will to power. And yet Nietzscheneither thought justice explicitly as the essence of the truth of

34\. Heidegger italicizes \"interest\" and \"more.\"

The Word of Nietzsche 93

what is nor brought to utterance from out of such thought themetaphysics of completed subjectness. Justice is, however, thetruth of whatever is, the truth determined by Being itself. Asthis truth it is metaphysics itself in its modern completion. Inmetaphysics as such is concealed the reason why Nietzsche canindeed experience nihilism metaphysically as the history of value-positing, yet nevertheless cannot think the essence of nihilism.

We do not know what concealed form, ordained from out ofthe essence of justice as its truth, was reserved for the meta-physics of the will to power. Scarcely has its first fundamentalprinciple been articulated; and when it has, it has not once beenexperienced in the form of a principle. To be sure, within thismetaphysics the principle-character of that principle is of apeculiar kind. Certainly the first value-principle is not the majorpremise for a deductive system of propositions. If we take careto understand the designation \"fundamental principle of meta-physics\" as naming the essential ground of whatever is as such,i.e., as naming the latter in the unity of its essence, then thisprinciple remains sufficiently broad and intricate to determine atany given time, according to the particular type of metaphysics,the way in which the latter declares that ground.

Nietzsche articulated the first value-principle of the meta-physics of the will to power in still another form: \"We possessart lest we perish of the truth\" {Will to Power, Aph. 822).

We must not, of course, understand in terms of our everydayconceptions of truth and art this principle that concerns themetaphysical relation pertaining to essence---i.e., the meta-physical value-relation---that subsists between art and truth.If that happens, everything becomes banal and, what is all themore ominous, takes from us the possibility of attempting anessential discussion with the concealed position of the meta-physics of our world age---a metaphysics now coming to com-pletion---in order that we may free our own historical essencefrom being clouded by historiography and world views.

In the formulation of the fundamental principle of the meta-physics of the will to power just cited, art and truth are thoughtas the primary forms of the holding-sway of the will to power inrelation to man. How the essential relation of the truth of whatis as such to man\'s essence is to be thought at all within meta-

94 The Question Concerning Technology

physics in keeping with the latter\'s essence remains veiled toour thinking. The question is scarcely asked, and because ofthe predominance of philosophical anthropology it is hopelesslyconfused. In any case, however, it would be erroneous were weto take the formulation of the value-principle as testimony thatNietzsche philosophizes existentially. That he never did. But hedid think metaphysically. We are not yet mature enough forthe rigor of a thought of the kind found in the following notethat Nietzsche wrote down at about the time when he was doingthe thinking for his projected masterpiece, The Will to Power:\"Around the hero everything turns into tragedy; around thedemi-god, into a satyr-play; and around God---what?---perhapsinto \'world\'?\" (Beyond Good and Evil, Aph. 150, 1886).

But the time has come for us to learn to perceive that Nietz-sche\'s thinking, although it must display another mien whenjudged historiographically and on the basis of the label assignedit, is no less possessed of matter and substance and is no lessrigorous than is the thinking of Aristotle, who in the fourth bookof his Metaphysics thinks the principle of contradiction as theprimary truth regarding the Being of whatever is. The comparisonbetween Nietzsche and Kierkegaard that has become customary,but is no less questionable for that reason, fails to recognize, andindeed out of a misunderstanding of the essence of thinking,that Nietzsche as a metaphysical thinker preserves a closeness toAristotle. Kierkegaard remains essentially remote from Aristotle,although he mentions him more often. For Kierkegaard is not athinker but a religious writer, and indeed not just one amongothers, but the only one in accord with the destining belongingto his age. Therein lies his greatness, if to speak in this way isnot already a misunderstanding.

In the fundamental principle of Nietzsche\'s metaphysics theunity of the essence of the will to power is named with thenaming of the essential relation between art and truth. Out ofthis unity of essence belonging to what is as such, the meta-physical essence of value is determined. Value is the twofoldcondition of the will to power itself, posited in the will to powerfor the will to power.

Because Nietzsche experiences the Being of everything that isas the will to power, his thinking must think out toward value.

The Word of Nietzsche 95

Thus it is valid, everywhere and before everything else, to posethe question of value. This questioning comes to experience itselfas historical.

How does it stand with the highest values up to now? Whatdoes the devaluing of those values mean in relation to the re-valuing of all values? Because thinking in terms of values isgrounded in the metaphysics of the will to power, Nietzsche\'sinterpretation of nihilism as the event of the devaluing of thehighest values and the revaluing of all values is a metaphysicalinterpretation, and that in the sense of the metaphysics of thewill to power. However, inasmuch as Nietzsche understands hisown thinking---the doctrine of the will to power as the \"principleof the new value-positing\"---in the sense of the actual consum-mation of nihilism, he no longer understands nihilism merelynegatively as the devaluing of the highest values, but at thesame time he understands it positively, that is, as the overcomingof nihilism; for the reality of the real, now explicitly experienced,i.e., the will to power, becomes the origin and norm of a newvalue-positing. Its values directly determine human representingand in like manner inspire human activity. Being human is liftedinto another dimension of happening.

In the passage quoted from The Gay Science (Aph. 125), themadman says this of the act of men whereby God was killed, i.e.,whereby the suprasensory world was devalued: \"There has neverbeen a greater deed; and whoever will be born after us---for thesake of this deed he will be part of a higher history than allhistory hitherto.\"

With the consciousness that \"God is dead,\" there begins theconsciousness of a radical revaluing of the highest values hitherto.Man himself, according to this consciousness, passes over intoanother history that is higher, because in it the principle of allvalue-positing, the will to power, is experienced and acceptedexpressly as the reality of the real, as the Being of everythingthat is. With this, the self-consciousness in which modern hu-manity has its essence completes its last step. It wills itself asthe executer of the unconditional will to power. The decline ofthe normative values is at an end. Nihilism, \"that the highestvalues are devaluing themselves,\" has been overcome. Thehumanity which wills its own being human as the will to power,

96 The Question Concerning Technology

and experiences that being human as belonging within the realitydetermined in its entirety by the will to power, is determined bya form of man\'s essence that goes beyond and surpasses manhitherto.

The name for this form of man\'s essence that surpasses therace of men up to now is \"overman.\"35 By this name Nietzschedoes not mean any isolated exemplar of man in whom theabilities and purposes of man as ordinarily known are magnifiedand enhanced to gigantic proportions. \"Overman\" is also notthat form of man that first originates upon the path of thepractical application of Nietzsche\'s philosophy to life. The name\"overman\" designates the essence of humanity, which, as modernhumanity, is begining to enter into the consummation belongingto the essence of its age. \"Overman\" is man who is man fromout of the reality determined through the will to power, and forthat reality.

Man whose essence is that essence which is willing, i.e., ready,from out of the will to power is overman. The willing that char-acterizes the essence of man that is willing in this way mustcorrespond to the will to power as to the Being of whatever is.Therefore, simultaneously with the thinking that thinks the willto power, there necessarily arises the question: In what formmust the essence of man that becomes willing from out of theBeing of what is, present itself and unfold, in order that it maybe adequate to the will to power and may thus be capable ofreceiving dominion over all that is? Unexpectedly, and above allin a way unforeseen, man finds himself, from out of the Beingof what is, set before the task of taking over dominion of the

35\. \"Overman\" is the translation of der Ubermensch, which ordinarilymeans superhuman being, demigod, superman. The term \"overman,\" intro-duced into Nietzsche translation by Walter Kaufmann, has the advantageof avoiding the misinterpretations that lie ready to hand in the usual trans-lation as \"superman.\" In keeping with Nietzsche\'s presentation of derUbermensch in the figure of Zarathustra, Kaufmann regularly uses \"theoverman.\" Here the article has been dropped in the translation of the nounin accordance with the fact that, as Heidegger\'s ensuing discussion itselfmakes clear, Ubermensch is not intended in that discussion to refer at allto an individual man. Rather, the noun has a generic meaning---it refers toman, to humanity. Ubermensch might almost be translated \"man-beyond,\"for overman stands in contrast with man hitherto and goes beyond (hin-ausgeht . . . iiber) the latter in his surpassing of him.

The Word of Nietzsche 97

earth. Has man hitherto sufficiently considered in what modethe Being of what is has meanwhile appeared? Has man hithertoassured himself as to whether his essence has the maturity andstrength to correspond to the claim of that Being? Or does manhitherto simply get along with the help of expedients and detoursthat drive him away ever anew from experiencing that which is?8,;Man hitherto would like to remain man hitherto; and yet he isat the same time already the one who, of all that is, is willing---whose Being is beginning to appear as the will to power. Manhitherto is, in his essence, not yet at all prepared for Being,which all the while has been holding complete sway over whatis. In the latter there rules the necessity that man go beyond manhitherto, not out of mere desire or mere arbitrariness, but solelyfor the sake of Being.

Nietzsche\'s thought that thinks overman arises from the think-ing that thinks whatever is ontologically as what is in being, andit thus accommodates itself to the essence of metaphysics, yetwithout being able to experience that essence from within meta-physics. For this reason the respect in which the essence of manis determined from out of the essence of Being remains concealedfor Nietzsche, just as it does in all metaphysics before him. There-fore, the ground of the essential connection between the will topower and the essence of overman necessarily veils itself inNietzsche\'s metaphysics. Yet in every veiling there already rulessimultaneously an appearing. The existentia that belongs to theessentia of whatever is, i.e., to the will to power, is the eternalreturning of the same. The Being that is thought in that return-ing contains the relation to the essence of overman. But thisrelation necessarily remains unthought in its essence as thatessence relates to Being. It thus remains obscure even to Nietzschehimself what connection the thinking that thinks overman in thefigure of Zarathustra has with the essence of metaphysics. Hencethe character of the work Thus Spoke Zarathustra as a workremains concealed. Only when some future thought is broughtinto the situation of thinking this \"Book for All and None\"

36\. Here, \"that which is\" exceptionally translates das . . . was ist, ratherthan das Seiende. This allusion will return below (p. 102) in the question,\"What is?\" where the reference in question is Being itself and not anyparticular being. Cf. T 46.

98 The Question Concerning Technology

together with Schelling\'s Investigations on the Essence of HumanFreedom (1809)---and that means at the same time also withHegel\'s work The Phenomenology of Mind (1807), and also withthe Monadology (1714) of Leibniz---and only when it is broughtinto the situation of thinking these works not only metaphysicallybut from out of the essence of metaphysics will there be estab-lished the right and duty as well as the foundation and horizonfor an explication.

It is easy but irresponsible to be indignant at the idea andfigure of overman, which has clothed itself in the very misunder-standing that attaches to it, and to make this indignation passfor a refutation. It is difficult, but for future thinking it will beinescapable, to attain to the high responsibility out of whichNietzsche pondered the essence of that humanity which, in thedestining of Being as the will to power, is being determinedtoward the assuming of dominion over the earth. The essence ofoverman is no license for the frenzy of self-will. It is the lawgrounded in Being itself of a long chain of the highest of self-conquests that are first making man mature for that which is,which, as that which is, belongs to Being---to Being that, as thewill to power, is bringing to appearance its essence as will, andthrough that appearing is making an epoch, namely, the ultimateepoch of metaphysics.

Man hitherto is called this, according to Nietzsche\'s meta-physics, because, although his essence is indeed determined bythe will to power as the fundamental characteristic of all thatis, he has still not experienced and accepted the will to poweras that principal characteristic. Man who surpasses man up tonow takes the will to power, as the principal characteristic of allthat is, up into his own willing and in that way wills himself inthe manner of the will to power. All that is, is as that which isposited within this will. That which formerly conditioned anddetermined the essence of man in the manner of purpose andnorm has lost its unconditional and immediate, above all itsubiquitously and infallibly operative power of effective action.That suprasensory world of purposes and norms no longerquickens and supports life. That world has itself become life-less, dead. There will be Christian faith here and there. Butthe love holding sway in that world is not the effectively work-

ing and operative principle of what is happening now. The supra-sensory ground consisting of the suprasensory world, thoughtas the operative, working reality of everything real, has becomeunreal.37 That is the metaphysical meaning of the word \"God isdead/\' thought metaphysically.

Will we persist in closing our eyes in face of the truth of thisword, to be thought in this way? If we do so, the word willcertainly not become untrue through this curious blindness. Godis still not a living God when we persist in trying to master thereal without taking God\'s reality seriously and calling it in ques-tion beforehand, and when we persist in this without ponderingwhether man has so matured for the essence into which, fromout of Being, he is being drawn, that he may withstand andsurmount that destining genuinely from out of his essence andnot do so with the sham help of mere expedients.

The attempt to experience the truth of that word concerningthe death of God without illusions is something different froman espousing of Nietzsche\'s philosophy. Were the latter our in-tention, thinking would not be served through such assent. Weshow respect for a thinker only when we think. This demandsthat we think everything essential that is thought in his thought.

When God and the gods are dead in the sense of the meta-physical experience just elucidated, and when the will to poweris deliberately willed as the principle of all positing of the con-ditions governing whatever is, i.e., as the principle of value-positing, then dominion over that which is as such, in the formof dominion over the earth, passes to the new willing of mandetermined by the will to power. Nietzsche closes the first partof Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which appeared one year after TheGay Science, in 1883, with the statement: \"Dead are all gods:now we will that overman live!\"

We could believe, were we thinking crassly, that this pro-nouncement says that dominion over all that is, is passing fromGod to man or, even more crassly, that Nietzsche puts man inthe place of God. Those who believe thus do not, of course, think

100 The Question Concerning Technology

in a very godly way about the divine essence. Never can manput himself in the place of God, because the essence of mannever reaches the essential realm belonging to God. On the con-trary, compared with this impossibility something far more un-canny can happen, something whose essence we have scarcelybegun to consider. Thought metaphysically, the place that ispeculiar to God is the place of the causative bringing about andpreserving of whatever is, as something created. That place ofGod can remain empty. Instead of it, another, i.e., a place corre-sponding metaphysically, can loom on the horizon---a place thatis identical neither with the essential realm belonging to God norwith that of man, but with which man comes once more into adistinctive relationship. Overman never enters at all into the placeof God; rather the place into which his willing enters is anotherrealm belonging to another grounding of what is, in its otherBeing. This other Being of what is, meanwhile---and this marksthe beginning of modern metaphysics---has become subjectness.

All that is, is now either what is real \[das Wirkliche\] as theobject or what works the real \[das Wirkende\], as the objectify-ing within which the objectivity of the object takes shape. Ob-jectifying, in representing, in setting before, delivers up theobject to the ego cogito. In that delivering up, the ego provesto be that which underlies its own activity (the delivering upthat sets before), i.e., proves to be the subiectum. The subjectis subject for itself. The essence of consciousness is self-con-sciousness. Everything that is, is therefore either the object ofthe subject or the subject of the subject. Everywhere the Beingof whatever is lies in setting-itself-before-itself and thus insetting-itself-up. Man, within the subjectness belonging to what-ever is, rises up into the subjectivity of his essence. Man entersinto insurrection. The world changes into object. In this revolu-tionary objectifying of everything that is, the earth, that whichfirst of all must be put at the disposal of representing and settingforth, moves into the midst of human positing and analyzing.The earth itself can show itself only as the object of assault, anassault that, in human willing, establishes itself as unconditionalobjectification. Nature appears everywhere---because willed fromout of the essence of Being---as the object of technology.

From the same period, 1881-82, in which the passage \'The

The Word of Nietzsche 101

Madman\" originated comes this note of Nietzsche\'s: \"The timeis coming when the struggle for dominion over the earth will becarried on. It will be carried on in the name of fundamentalphilosophical doctrines\" (XII, 441).\'As

This does not mean that the struggle for unlimited exploita-tion of the earth as the sphere of raw materials and for therealistic utilization of \"human material,\" in the service of theunconditional empowering of the will to power in its essence,would specifically have recourse to an appeal to a philosophy.On the contrary, it is to be conjectured that philosophy as thedoctrine and image of culture will disappear, and that also inits present form it can disappear; for insofar as it has beengenuine it has already brought the reality of the real to utteranceand in that way has brought that which is as such into thehistory of its Being. \"Fundamental philosophical doctrines\" doesnot mean the doctrines of scholars but the language of the truthof what is as such, which truth metaphysics itself is in the formof the metaphysics of the unconditional subjectness of the willto power.

The struggle for dominion over the earth is in its historicalessence already the result of the fact that whatever is as such isappearing in the mode of the will to power without yet beingrecognized or without being understood at all as that will. Atany rate, the doctrines of action and the conceptual ideologiesthat are commonly subscribed to never utter that which is, andwhich therefore is happening. With the beginning of the strugglefor dominion over the earth, the age of subjectness is drivingtoward its consummation. To this completion belongs the factthat whatever is---which is in the manner of the will to power---is, after its fashion and in every respect, becoming certain andtherefore also conscious of its own truth about itself. Makingconscious is a necessary instrument of the willing that wills fromout of the will to power. It happens, in respect to objectification,in the form of planning. It happens, in the sphere of the upris-ing of man into self-willing, through the ceaseless dissecting ofthe historical situation. Thought metaphysically, the \"situation\"is constantly the stage for the action of a subject. Every analysis

38\. Italics Heidegger\'s.

102 The Question Concerning Technology

of the situation is grounded, whether it knows it or not, in themetaphysics of subjectness.

\'The great noon\" is the time of the brightest brightness,namely, of the consciousness that unconditionally and in everyrespect has become conscious of itself as that knowing whichconsists in deliberately willing the will to power as the Beingof whatever is; and, as such willing, in rebelliously withstandingand subjugating to itself every necessary phase of the objectify-ing of the world, thus making secure the stably constant reserveof what is for a willing of the greatest possible uniformity andequality. In the willing of this will, however, there comes uponman the necessity that he concomitantly will the conditions, therequirements, of such a willing. That means: to posit values andto ascribe worth to everything in keeping with values. In sucha manner does value determine all that is in its Being. This bringsus to the question:

What is now, in the age when the unconditional dominion ofthe will to power is openly dawning, and this openness and itspublic character are themselves becoming a function of this will?What is? We are not asking about events and facts, for everyone of which at any time, in the realm of the will to power,testimonies may always be brought forward and laid aside ondemand.

What is? We do not ask concerning this or that particularbeing, but rather we ask concerning the Being of whatever is.More especially, we are asking what is happening to Beingitself. Furthermore, we do not ask at random, but with a view tothe truth of what is as such, which is coming to utterance inthe form of the metaphysics of the will to power. What is hap-pening to Being in the age of the dominion, now beginning, ofthe unconditional will to power?

Being has been transformed into a value.39 The making con-

39\. Within the highly elliptical connection between this and the follow-ing sentence in the text lies Heidegger\'s understanding of the complexinterrelation of Being, what is, and man. That meaning might, in the con-text of the present discussion of the will to power, be suggested as follows.

The \"Being\" to which Heidegger here refers is, first of all, the Beingpossessed by what is. The metaphysics of the will to power, which thinksBeing in thinking the truth, the unconcealedness of what is, takes theBeing of what is---a Being linked indissolubly with the security and certainty

The Word of Nietzsche 103

stant of the stability of the constant reserve40 is a necessary con-dition of its own securing of itself, which the will to poweritself posits. Can Being possibly be more highly esteemed thanthrough being expressly raised to a value? Yet, in that Being isaccorded worth as a value, it is already degraded to a conditionposited by the will to power itself. Already from of old, insofaras Being itself has been esteemed at all and thus given worth,it has been despoiled of the dignity of its essence. When theBeing of whatever is, is stamped as a value and its essence isthereby sealed off, then within this metaphysics---and that meanscontinually within the truth of what is as such during this age---every way to the experiencing of Being itself is obliterated. Here,in speaking in such a way, we presuppose what we should per-haps not presuppose at all, that such a way to Being has at some

of the objectively represented---as a value, a determining condition directingpower-actualizing willing. Hence the metaphysics of the will to power can,with Nietzsche, take Being to be a value (cf. p. 84); or it might say thatto be is to have value. And it is Being itself, ruling in the modern age inthe mode of the will to power, that gives itself to the thinking of meta-physics in this way. Yet, at the same time, metaphysics is not here thinkingBeing itself. It is not thinking Being as Being, \"presencing specifically aspresencing, from out of its truth\" (p. 109). Being, in manifesting itselfprecisely as value through the thinking belonging to the metaphysics ofthe will to power, is, at the same time, concealing itself as regards thatwhich it is as Being.

Metaphysics, for Heidegger, \"grounds an age\" (AWP 115). In interpret-ing or in laying out (auslegen), i.e., in thinking forth, the Being of what isprecisely as a value, that is, in making Being manifest---insofar as it isgiven to metaphysics to apprehend and manifest Being at all in the latter\'sholding-sway in the mode of the will to power---the metaphysics of the willto power, as the consummation of the modern metaphysics begun withDescartes, provides the thought-out basis for the activity of modern man.And Being needs that activity, undergirded by that thinking, in order toendure as present and to rule in the manner that is now proper to it.Precisely when Being has become a value, when to be is to have value, themetaphysical basis has been consummately given for that human activitythrough which whatever is---offering itself in the manner governed by thewill to power---is fixed as a stable reserve that has value and can be of usejust in virtue of its being and of its being available for future \"willing towill\" and \"empowering to power.\" And precisely through just that meta-physically grounded activity and through it alone, the holding-sway ofBeing---of Being now manifesting itself in the mode of the will to power---isaccomplishing itself through the only open center through which it canever find accomplishment, namely, through man.

104 The Question Concerning Technology

time existed and that a thinking on Being has already thoughtBeing as Being.

Unmindful of Being and its own truth, Western thinking hassince its beginning continually been thinking what is in beingas such. All the while, this thinking has been thinking Beingonly in such truth, so that it brings the name \"Being\" to utter-ance only with considerable awkwardness and in a manifoldnessof meaning that remains confused because it is not experienced.This thinking that has remained unmindful of Being itself is thesimple and all-sustaining, thus enigmatic and unexperienced,coming-to-pass \[Ereignis\] of that Western history which mean-while is on the point of broadening out into world history.Finally, in metaphysics, Being has debased itself to a value.Herein lies the testimony that Being has not been accepted andacknowledged as Being. What does this mean?

What is happening to Being? Nothing is happening to Being.41But what if, precisely in that, the essence of nihilism, which hasbeen veiled up to now, were first to proclaim itself? Wouldthinking in terms of values then itself be pure nihilism? Butsurely Nietzsche understands the metaphysics of the will topower specifically as the overcoming of nihilism. And in fact, solong as nihilism is understood only as the devaluing of the highestvalues, and the will to power, as the principle of the revaluing ofall values, is thought from out of a re-positing of the highestvalues, the metaphysics of the will to power is indeed an over-coming of nihilism. But in this overcoming of nihilism value-thinking is elevated to a principle.

If, however, value does not let Being be Being, does not let itbe what it is as Being itself, then this supposed overcoming isabove all the consummation of nihilism. For now metaphysicsnot only does not think Being itself, but this not-thinking ofBeing clothes itself in the illusion that it does think Being in themost exalted manner, in that it esteems Being as a value, so that

all questions concerning Being become and remain superfluous.But if the thinking that thinks everything in terms of values isnihilism when thought in relation to Being itself, then evenNietzsche\'s own experience of nihilism, i.e., that it is the devalu-ing of the highest values, is after all a nihilistic one. The interpre-tation of the suprasensory world, the interpretation of God asthe highest value, is not thought from out of Being itself. Theultimate blow against God and against the suprasensory worldconsists in the fact that God, the first of beings,42 is degradedto the highest value. The heaviest blow against God is not thatGod is held to be unknowable, not that God\'s existence isdemonstrated to be unprovable, but rather that the god heldto be real is elevated to the highest value. For this blow comesprecisely not from those who are standing about, who do notbelieve in God, but from the believers and their theologians whodiscourse on the being that is of all beings most in being,43without ever letting it occur to them to think on Being itself, inorder thereby to become aware that, seen from out of faith,their thinking and their talking is sheer blasphemy if it meddlesin the theology of faith.

Now, for the first time a faint light begins to penetrate thedarkness enveloping the question that earlier we wanted todirect to Nietzsche while we were hearing the passage about themadman. How can it happen at all that men are ever capable ofkilling God? But obviously it is precisely this that Nietzsche isthinking. For in the entire passage there are only two sentencesexpressly placed in italics. The one reads: \"We have killed him,\"namely, God. The other reads: \"And yet they have done it them-selves,\" which is to say men have performed the deed of killingGod, even though today they have still heard nothing about it.

The two italicized sentences give the interpretation for theword \"God is dead.\" The pronouncement does not mean---asthough it were spoken out of denial and common hatred---thereis no god. The pronouncement means something worse: God hasbeen killed. In this way the decisive thought first comes toappearance. Yet, nevertheless, the understanding of it becomesmore difficult. For the word \"God is dead\" would be much more

106 The Question Concerning Technology

readily grasped if it declared: God himself, of his own accord,has distanced himself from his living presence. But that Godshould be killed by others and indeed by men is unthinkable.Nietzsche himself is astounded at this thought. It is only forthat reason that immediately after the decisive words, \'We havekilled him---you and I. All of us are his murderers/\' he allowsthe madman to ask: \"But how have we done this?\" Nietzscheelucidates the question as he repeats it, spelling out what isasked in three images: \"How were we able to drink up the sea?Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? Whatdid we do when we unchained this earth from its sun?\"

To the last question we could answer: What men did whenthey unchained the earth from its sun is told in the last threeand a half centuries of European history. What, then, has hap-pened at the foundation of this history to that which is? WhenNietzsche names the relationship between the sun and the earthhe is not thinking merely of the Copernican revolution in themodern understanding of nature. The word \"sun\" at once recallsPlato\'s allegory. According to the latter, the sun and the realmof its light are the sphere in which that which is appears accord-ing to its visible aspect, or according to its many countenances(Ideas). The sun forms and circumscribes the field of visionwherein that which is as such shows itself.44 \"Horizon\" refers

44\. Here \"forms\" translates bildet. The German bilden means to form,to shape, to constitute. In this passage the meaning of \"constitute\" shouldbe heard within the translation \"forms\" virtually with the force of \"is.\"The word \"sun\" speaks, as does the word \"horizon\" that follows, of theself-manifesting that characterizes what is as such. It speaks of what is asbeing, in itself, unconcealed. In thinking in his own way Nietzsche\'s---andPlato\'s---image of the sun, Heidegger speaks here of what is, the real, asthat which is looked at because it lets itself be seen. It is just this characterof what is---as what gives itself to sight---that, in what here immediatelyfollows, he sees as transformed in the modern period, so that it appearsdifferently when, under the dominion of the will to power, everything realis transformed into value, i.e., into \"point-of-view,\" that both is seen andpermits seeing. When possessed of this new character, what is, is no longerfree to show itself directly in itself. It is, rather, either as subject or asobject, always at the disposal of assertive self-consciousness, and hence ofthat mode of Being, the will to power, ruling in the latter. Accordingly, inhis discussion of the meaning of value for Nietzsche as \"point-of-view,\"Heidegger has said above (p. 72): \"Aim, view, field of vision, mean hereboth the sight beheld and seeing, in a sense that is determined from out ofGreek thought. . . .\"

The Word of Nietzsche 107

to the suprasensory world as the world that truly is. This is atthe same time that whole which envelops all and in itself in-cludes all, as does the sea. The earth, as the abode of man, isunchained from its sun. The realm that constitutes the supra-sensory, which as such, is in itself40 no longer stands over manas the authoritative light. The whole field of vision has beenwiped away. The whole of that which is as such, the sea, has beendrunk up by man. For man has risen up into the I-ness of theego cogito. Through this uprising, all that is, is transformed intoobject. That which is, as the objective, is swallowed up into theimmanence of subjectivity. The horizon no longer emits light ofitself. It is now nothing but the point-of-view posited in thevalue-positing of the will to power.

By means of the three key images (sun, horizon, and sea),which are for thinking presumably something quite other thanimages, the three questions elucidate what is meant by the eventof the killing of God. The killing means the act of doing awaywith the suprasensory world that is in itself---an act accomplishedthrough man. It speaks of the event wherein that which is assuch does not simply come to nothing, but does indeed becomedifferent in its Being. But above all, in this event man also be-comes different. He becomes the one who does away with thatwhich is, in the sense of that which is in itself. The uprising ofman into subjectivity transforms that which is into object. Butthat which is objective is that which is brought to a stand throughrepresenting. The doing away with that which is in itself, i.e.,the killing of God, is accomplished in the making secure of theconstant reserve by means of which man makes secure for himselfmaterial, bodily, psychic, and spiritual resources, and this forthe sake of his own security, which wills dominion over what-ever is---as the potentially objective---in order to correspond tothe Being of whatever is, to the will to power.

Making secure, as the creating of secureness, is grounded invalue-positing. Value-positing has brought down and slain be-neath itself---and has therefore killed as that which is for itself---all that is in itself. This ultimate blow in the killing of God isperpetrated by metaphysics, which, as the metaphysics of the

45\. des an sich seienden Ubersiiinlichen.

108 The Question Concerning Technology

will to power, accomplishes thinking in the sense of value-thinking. However, Nietzsche himself no longer recognizes thisultimate blow, through which Being is struck down to a merevalue, for what the blow is when thought with respect to Beingitself. And yet, does not Nietzsche himself say: \"All of us are hismurderers!---you and I\"? Certainly. And according to this,Nietzsche also continues to understand the metaphysics of thewill to power as nihilism. To be sure. But this means for Nietz-sche only that that metaphysics, as the countermovement in thesense of the revaluing of all former values, brings to completionthe previous \"devaluing of the highest values hitherto\" mostradically, because definitively.

And yet Nietzsche can no longer think as killing and nihilismprecisely that new positing of value on the basis of the prin-ciple of all value-positing. Within the field of vision of the self-willing will to power, i.e., within the perspective of value andvalue-positing, that new positing of value is no longer a de-valuing.

But what happens to value-positing itself when value-positingis thought in respect to that which is as such, and that means atthe same time from out of a view toward Being? Then, thinkingin terms of values is radical killing. It not only strikes downthat which is as such, in its being-in-itself, but it does awayutterly with Being. The latter can, where it is still needed, passonly for a value. The value-thinking of the metaphysics of thewill to power is murderous in a most extreme sense, because itabsolutely does not let Being itself take its rise, i.e., come intothe vitality of its essence. Thinking in terms of values precludesin advance that Being itself will attain to a coming to presencein its truth.

But is this murdering that kills at the roots first and exclu-sively the way of the metaphysics of the will to power? Is itonly the interpretation of Being as value that does not let Beingitself be the Being that it is? If this were the case, then meta-physics before Nietzsche would have to have experienced andthought Being itself in its truth, or at least to have questionedconcerning it. But nowhere do we find such, experiencing ofBeing itself. Nowhere are we confronted by a thinking that thinksthe truth of Being itself and therewith thinks truth itself as Being.

The Word of Nietzsche 109

This is not thought even where pre-Platonic thinking, as thebeginning of Western thinking, prepares for the unfolding ofmetaphysics in Plato and Aristotle. The estin (eon) gar einai doesindeed name Being itself. But it does not think presencing spe-cifically as presencing, from out of its truth. The history of Beingbegins, and indeed necessarily, with the forgetting of Being. It isnot due then to metaphysics as the metaphysics of the will topower that Being itself in its truth remains unthought. Thisstrange remaining-away of Being is due only to metaphysics asmetaphysics. But what is metaphysics? Do we know its essence?Can it itself know that essence? If it conceives it, it grasps itmetaphysically. But the metaphysical concept of metaphysicsconstantly falls short of its essence. This holds also for everylogic, assuming that logic is still at all capable of thinking whatlogos is. Every metaphysics of metaphysics, and every logic ofphilosophy, that in any way whatever attempts to climb beyondmetaphysics falls back most surely beneath metaphysics, withoutknowing where, precisely in so doing, it has fallen.

Meanwhile, at least one feature of the essence of nihilism hasbecome clearer to our thinking. The essence of nihilism lies inhistory; accordingly, in the appearing of whatever is as such, inits entirety, Nothing is befalling Being itself and its truth, andindeed in such a way that the truth of what is as such passes forBeing, because the truth of Being remains wanting. In the ageof that completion and consummation of nihilism which is be-ginning, Nietzsche indeed experienced some characteristics ofnihilism, and at the same time he explained them nihilistically,thus completely eclipsing their essence. And yet Nietzsche neverrecognized the essence of nihilism, just as no metaphysics beforehim ever did.

But if the essence of nihilism lies in history, so that the truthof Being remains wanting in the appearing of whatever is assuch, in its entirety, and if, accordingly, Nothing is befallingBeing and its truth, then metaphysics as the history of the truthof what is as such, is, in its essence, nihilism. If, finally, meta-physics is the historical ground of the world history that isbeing determined by Europe and the West, then that worldhistory is, in an entirely different sense, nihilistic.

Thought from out of the destining of Being, the nihil in

110 The Question Concerning Technology

\"nihilism\" means that Nothing is befalling Being. Being is notcoming into the light of its own essence. In the appearing ofwhatever is as such, Being itself remains wanting. The truth ofBeing falls from memory. It remains forgotten.

Thus nihilism would be in its essence a history that runs itscourse along with Being itself. It would lie in Being\'s own es-sence, then, that Being remain unthought because it withdraws.Being itself withdraws into its truth. It harbors itself safelywithin its truth and conceals itself in such harboring.

In looking toward this self-concealing harboring of its ownessence, perhaps we glimpse the essence of that mystery in theguise of which the truth of Being is coming to presence.

According to this, metaphysics itself would not be merely aneglect of a question still to be pondered concerning Being.Surely it would not be an error. Metaphysics, as the history ofthe truth of what is as such, would have come to pass from out ofthe destining of Being itself. Metaphysics would be, in its essence,the mystery of Being itself, a mystery that is unthought becausewithheld. Were it otherwise, a thinking that takes pains to holdto Being in what is to be thought could not unceasingly ask,\"What is metaphysics?\"

Metaphysics is an epoch46 of the history of Being itself. Butin its essence metaphysics is nihilism. The essence of nihilismbelongs to that history as which Being itself comes to presence.However, provided that Nothing in whatever manner also pointstoward Being, the determination and defining of nihilism fromout of the history of Being might well at least indicate antece-dently the realm within which the essence of nihilism can beexperienced in order to become something thought that con-cerns our thinking. We are accustomed above all to hearing afalse note in the name \"nihilism.\" However, when we ponderthe essence of nihilism as belonging to the history of Being,there is at once something dubious in simply hearing a falsenote. The word \"nihilism\" indicates that nihil (Nothing) is, andis essentially, in that which it names. Nihilism means: Nothingis befalling everything and in every respect. \"Everything\" meanswhatever is, in its entirety. And whatever is stands there in

46\. A self-withholding.

The Word of Nietzsche 111

every respect proper to it when it is experienced as that whichis. Hence nihilism means that Nothing is befalling whatever isas such, in its entirety. But whatever is, is what it is and how itis from out of Being. Assuming that every \"is\" lies in Being,the essence of nihilism consists in the fact that Nothing is be-falling Being itself. Being itself is Being in its truth, which truthbelongs to Being.

When we hear in the name \"nihilism\" that other note whereinsounds the essence of that which it names, then we are alsohearing differently the language of that metaphysical thinkingwhich has experienced something of nihilism without being ableto think its essence. Perhaps with that other note in our ears, wewill someday ponder the age of that consummation of nihilismwhich is now beginning in another way than we have hitherto.Perhaps then we will recognize that neither the political nor theeconomic nor the sociological, nor the technological and scientific,nor even the metaphysical and the religious perspectives areadequate to think what is happening in that age. What is givento thinking to think is not some deeply hidden underlying mean-ing, but rather something lying near, that which lies nearest,which, because it is only this, we have therefore constantly al-ready passed over. Through this passing over we are, withoutnoticing it, constantly accomplishing the killing in relation tothe Being of whatever is in being.

In order to pay heed to it and to learn to pay heed, it can beenough for us simply to ponder for once what the madman saysabout the death of God and how he says it. Perhaps we will nolonger pass by so quickly without hearing what is said at thebeginning of the passage that has been elucidated: that themadman \"cried incessantly: I seek God! I seek God!\'\'

In what respect is this man mad? He is \"de-ranged.\"47 For heis dis-lodged from the level of man hitherto, where the ideals ofthe suprasensory world, which have become unreal, are passedoff for real while yet their opposite is realizing itself. This de-

47\. \"De-ranged\" translates ver-ruckt, which, unhyphenated, means mador insane. Other adjectival translations of related past participles built onrucken (to jerk, to pull, to change the place of) follow here: \"dislodged\"(ausgeriickt), \"carried out beyond\" (hinausgeruckt), and \"drawn into\"(eingeruckt).

112 The Question Concerning Technology

ranged man is carried out beyond man hitherto. Nevertheless,in this way he has only been drawn utterly into being the pre-determined essence of man hitherto, the animal rationale. Theman who is deranged in this way has nothing in common withthe kind of men standing about in the market place \"who do notbelieve in God.\" For these men are not unbelievers because Godas God has to them become unworthy of belief, but rather be-cause they themselves have given up the possibility of belief,inasmuch as they are no longer able to seek God. They can nolonger seek because they no longer think. Those standing aboutin the market place have abolished thinking and replaced itwith idle babble that scents nihilism in every place in which itsupposes its own opinion to be endangered. This self-deception,forever gaining the upper hand in relation to genuine nihilism,attempts in this way to talk itself out of its anguished dread inthe face of thinking. But that dread is dread in the face of dread.The madman, on the contrary, is clearly, according to the first,and more clearly still according to the last, sentences of thepassage, for him who can hear, the one who seeks God, sincehe cries out after God. Has a thinking man perhaps here reallycried out de profundis? And the ear of our thinking, does itstill not hear the cry? It will refuse to hear it so long as it doesnot begin to think. Thinking begins only when we have cometo know that reason, glorified for centuries, is the most stiff-necked adversary of thought.

The Age of theWorld Picture

In metaphysics reflection is accomplished concerning the essenceof what is and a decision takes place regarding the essence oftruth.1 Metaphysics grounds an age, in that through a specificinterpretation of what is and through a specific comprehensionof truth it gives to that age the basis upon which it is essentiallyformed.\" This basis holds complete dominion over all the phe-nomena that distinguish the age. Conversely, in order that theremay be an adequate reflection upon these phenomena themselves,the metaphysical basis for them must let itself be apprehended

1\. \"Reflection\" translates Besinnung. On the meaning of the latter, seeSR 155 n. 1. \"Essence\" will be the translation of the noun Wesen in mostinstances of its occurrence in this essay. Occasionally the translation\"coming to presence\" will be used. Wesen must always be understood toallude, for Heidegger, not to any mere \"whatness,\" but to the manner inwhich anything, as what it is, takes its course and \"holds sway\" in itsongoing presence, i.e., the manner in which it endures in its presencing.See QT 30, 3 n. 1. \"What is\" renders the present participle seiend usedas a noun, das Seiende. On the translation of the latter, see T 40 n. 6.

2\. der Grund seines Wesensgestalt. Heidegger exemplifies the statementthat he makes here in his discussion of the metaphysics of Descartes asproviding the necessary interpretive ground for the manner in which, inthe subjectness of man as self-conscious subject, Being and all that is andman---in their immediate and indissoluble relation---come to presence in themodern age. See Appendix 9, pp. 150 ff.

116 The Question Concerning Technology

in them. Reflection is the courage to make the truth of our ownpresuppositions and the realm of our own goals into the thingsthat most deserve to be called in question (see Appendix l).3

One of the essential phenomena of the modern age is its sci-ence. A phenomenon of no less importance is machine tech-nology. We must not, however, misinterpret that technology asthe mere application of modern mathematical physical scienceto praxis. Machine technology is itself an autonomous trans-formation of praxis, a type of transformation wherein praxisfirst demands the employment of mathematical physical science.Machine technology remains up to now the most visible out-growth of the essence of modern technology, which is identicalwith the essence of modern metaphysics.

A third equally essential phenomenon of the modern periodlies in the event of art\'s moving into the purview of aesthetics.That means that the art work becomes the object of mere sub-jective experience, and that consequently art is considered to bean expression of human life.4

A fourth modern phenomenon manifests itself in the fact thathuman activity is conceived and consummated as culture. Thusculture is the realization of the highest values, through the nur-ture and cultivation of the highest goods of man. It lies in theessence of culture, as such nurturing, to nurture itself in its turnand thus to become the politics of culture.

A fifth phenomenon of the modern age is the loss of the gods.°This expression does not mean the mere doing away with thegods, gross atheism. The loss of the gods is a twofold process.On the one hand, the world picture is Christianized inasmuchas the cause of the world is posited as infinite, unconditional,

3\. Heidegger\'s explanatory appendixes begin on p. 137.

4\. Erlebnis, translated here as \"subjective experience\" and later as \"life-experience,\" is a term much used by life philosophers such as Dilthey andgenerally connotes adventure and event. It is employed somewhat pejora-tively here. The term Erfahrung, which is regularly translated in this volumeas \"experience,\" connotes discovery and learning, and also suffering andundergoing. Here and subsequently (i.e., \"mere religious experience\"),\"mere\" is inserted to maintain the distinction between Erlebnis andErfahrung.

5\. Entgotterung, here inadequately rendered as \"loss of the gods,\" ac-tually means something more like \"degodization.\"

The Age of the World Picture 117

absolute. On the other hand, Christendom transforms Christiandoctrine into a world view (the Christian world view), and inthat way makes itself modern and up to date. The loss of thegods is the situation of indecision regarding God and the gods.Christendom has the greatest share in bringing it about. But theloss of the gods is so far from excluding religiosity that ratheronly through that loss is the relation to the gods changed intomere \"religious experience.\" When this occurs, then the godshave fled. The resultant void is compensated for by means ofhistoriographical and psychological investigation of myth.

What understanding of what is, what interpretation of truth,lies at the foundation of these phenomena?

We shall limit the question to the phenomenon mentionedfirst, to science \[Wissenschaft\].

In what does the essence of modern science lie?

What understanding of what is and of truth provides the basisfor that essence? If we succeed in reaching the metaphysicalground that provides the foundation for science as a modernphenomenon, then the entire essence of the modern age will haveto let itself be apprehended from out of that ground.

When we use the word \"science\" today, it means somethingessentially different from the doctrina and scientia of the MiddleAges, and also from the Greek episteme. Greek science wasnever exact, precisely because, in keeping with its essence, itcould not be exact and did not need to be exact. Hence it makesno sense whatever to suppose that modern science is more exactthan that of antiquity. Neither can we say that the Galileandoctrine of freely falling bodies is true and that Aristotle\'steaching, that light bodies strive upward, is false; for the Greekunderstanding of the essence of body and place and of the rela-tion between the two rests upon a different interpretation ofbeings and hence conditions a correspondingly different kindof seeing and questioning of natural events. No one would pre-sume to maintain that Shakespeare\'s poetry is more advancedthan that of Aeschylus. It is still more impossible to say thatthe modern understanding of whatever is, is more correct thanthat of the Greeks. Therefore, if we want to grasp the essence ofmodern science, we must first free ourselves from the habit of

118 The Question Concerning Technology

comparing the new science with the old solely in terms of degree,from the point of view of progress.

The essence of what we today call science is research. In whatdoes the essence of research consist?

In the fact that knowing \[das Erkennen\] establishes itself asa procedure within some realm of what is, in nature or in history.Procedure does not mean here merely method or methodology.For every procedure already requires an open sphere in whichit moves. And it is precisely the opening up of such a sphere thatis the fundamental event in research. This is accomplishedthrough the projection within some realm of what is---in nature,for example---of a fixed ground plan6 of natural events. Theprojection sketches out in advance the manner in which theknowing procedure must bind itself and adhere to the sphereopened up. This binding adherence is the rigor of research.7Through the projecting of the ground plan and the prescribing ofrigor, procedure makes secure for itself its sphere of objectswithin the realm of Being. A look at that earliest science, whichis at the same time the normative one in the modern age, namely,mathematical physics, will make clear what we mean. Inasmuchas modern atomic physics still remains physics, what is essential---and only the essential is aimed at here---will hold for it also.

Modern physics is called mathematical because, in a remark-able way, it makes use of a quite specific mathematics. But itcan proceed mathematically in this way only because, in a deepersense, it is already itself mathematical. Ta mathemata means forthe Greeks that which man knows in advance in his observationof whatever is and in his intercourse with things: the corpo-reality of bodies, the vegetable character of plants, the animalityof animals, the humanness of man. Alongside these, belongingalso to that which is already-known, i.e., to the mathematical,are numbers. If we come upon three apples on the table, we

6\. Grundriss. The verb reissen means to tear, to rend, to sketch, to design,and the noun Riss means tear, gap, outline. Hence the noun Grundriss, firstsketch, ground plan, design, connotes a fundamental sketching out that isan opening up as well.

7\. \"Binding adherence\" here translates the noun Bindung. The noun couldalso be rendered \"obligation.\" It could thus be said that rigor is the obliga-tion to remain within the realm opened up.

The Age of the World Picture 119

recognize that there are three of them. But the number three,threeness, we already know. This means that number is some-thing mathematical. Only because numbers represent, as it were,the most striking of always-already-knowns, and thus offer themost familiar instance of the mathematical, is \"mathematical\"promptly reserved as a name for the numerical. In no way, how-ever, is the essence of the mathematical defined by numberness.Physics is, in general, the knowledge of nature, and, in particu-lar, the knowledge of material corporeality in its motion; forthat corporeality manifests itself immediately and universally ineverything natural, even if in a variety of ways. If physics takesshape explicitly, then, as something mathematical, this meansthat, in an especially pronounced way, through it and for itsomething is stipulated in advance as what is already-known.That stipulating has to do with nothing less than the plan orprojection of that which must henceforth, for the knowing ofnature that is sought after, be nature: the self-contained systemof motion of units of mass related spatiotemporally. Into thisground plan of nature, as supplied in keeping with its priorstipulation, the following definitions among others have beenincorporated: Motion means change of place. No motion ordirection of motion is superior to any other. Every place is equalto every other. No point in time has preference over any other.Every force is defined according to---i.e., is only---its conse-quences in motion, and that means in magnitude of change ofplace in the unity of time. Every event must be seen so as to befitted into this ground plan of nature. Only within the perspec-tive of this ground plan does an event in nature become visibleas such an event. This projected plan of nature finds its guar-antee in the fact that physical research, in every one of itsquestioning steps, is bound in advance to adhere to it. Thisbinding adherence, the rigor of research, has its own characterat any given time in keeping with the projected plan. The rigorof mathematical physical science is exactitude. Here all events,if they are to enter at all into representation as events of nature,must be defined beforehand as spatiotemporal magnitudes ofmotion. Such defining is accomplished through measuring, withthe help of number and calculation. But mathematical research

120 The Question Concerning Technology

into nature is not exact because it calculates with precision;rather it must calculate in this way because its adherence to itsobject-sphere has the character of exactitude. The humanisticsciences, in contrast, indeed all the sciences concerned with life,must necessarily be inexact just in order to remain rigorous.A living thing can indeed also be grasped as a spatiotemporalmagnitude of motion, but then it is no longer apprehended asliving. The inexactitude of the historical humanistic sciences isnot a deficiency, but is only the fulfillment of a demand essentialto this type of research. It is true, also, that the projecting andsecuring of the object-sphere of the historical sciences is notonly of another kind, but is much more difficult of executionthan is the achieving of rigor in the exact sciences.

Science becomes research through the projected plan andthrough the securing of that plan in the rigor of procedure. Pro-jection and rigor, however, first develop into what they are inmethodology. The latter constitutes the second essential char-acteristic of research. If the sphere that is projected is to becomeobjective, then it is a matter of bringing it to encounter us inthe complete diversity of its levels and interweavings. Thereforeprocedure must be free to view the changeableness in whateverencounters it. Only within the horizon of the incessant-othernessof change does the plenitude of particularity---of facts---showitself. But the facts must become objective \[gegenstandlich\].Hence procedure must represent \[vorstellen\] the changeable inits changing,8 must bring it to a stand and let the motion be amotion nevertheless. The fixedness of facts and the constantnessof their change as such is \"rule.\" The constancy of change inthe necessity of its course is \'law.\" It is only within the purviewof rule and law that facts become clear as the facts that theyare. Research into facts in the realm of nature is intrinsicallythe establishing and verifying of rule and law. Methodology,through which a sphere of objects comes into representation,

8\. Throughout this essay the literal meaning of vorstellen, which isusually translated with \"to represent/\' is constantly in the foreground, sothat the verb suggests specifically a setting-in-place-before that is an ob-jectifying, i.e., a bringing to a stand as object. See pp. 127, 129-30, 132; cf.Appendix 9, pp. 148 ff. Heidegger frequently hyphenates vorstellen in thisessay and its appendixes so as to stress the meaning that he intends.

The Age of the World Picture 121

has the character of clarifying on the basis of what is clear---ofexplanation. Explanation is always twofold. It accounts for anunknown by means of a known, and at the same time it verifiesthat known by means of that unknown. Explanation takes placein investigation. In the physical sciences investigation takesplace by means of experiment, always according to the kind offield of investigation and according to the type of explanationaimed at. But physical science does not first become researchthrough experiment; rather, on the contrary, experiment firstbecomes possible whjre and only where the knowledge of naturehas been transformed into research. Only because modern phys-ics is a physics that is essentially mathematical can it be experi-mental. Because neither medieval doctrina nor Greek epistemeis science in the sense of research, for these it is never a questionof experiment. To be sure, it was Aristotle who first understoodwhat empeiria (expetientia) means: the observation of thingsthemselves, their qualities and modifications under changingconditions, and consequently the knowledge of the way in whichthings as a rule behave. But an observation that aims at suchknowledge, the experimentum, remains essentially different fromthe observation that belongs to science as research, from theresearch experiment; it remains essentially different even whenancient and medieval observation also works with number andmeasure, and even when that observation makes use of specificapparatus and instruments. For in all this, that which is decisiveabout the experiment is completely missing. Experiment beginswith the laying down of a law as a basis. To set up an experimentmeans to represent or conceive \[vorstellen\] the conditions underwhich a specific series of motions can be made susceptible ofbeing followed in its necessary progression, i.e., of being con-trolled in advance by calculation. But the establishing of a lawis accomplished with reference to the ground plan of the object-sphere. That ground plan furnishes a criterion and constrainsthe anticipatory representing of the conditions. Such represent-ing in and through which the experiment begins is no randomimagining. That is why Newton said, hypothesis non jingo, \"thebases that are laid down are not arbitrarily invented.\" They aredeveloped out of the ground plan of nature and are sketchedinto it. Experiment is that methodology which, in its planning

122 The Question Concerning Technology

and execution, is supported and guided on the basis of thefundamental law laid down, in order to adduce the facts thateither verify and confirm the law or deny it confirmation. Themore exactly the ground plan of nature is projected, the moreexact becomes the possibility of experiment. Hence the much-cited medieval Schoolman Roger Bacon can never be the fore-runner of the modern experimental research scientist; rather heremains merely a successor of Aristotle. For in the meantime,the real locus of truth has been transferred by Christendom tofaith---to the infallibility of the written word and to the doctrineof the Church. The highest knowledge and teaching is theologyas the interpretation of the divine word of revelation, which isset down in Scripture and proclaimed by the Church. Here, toknow is not to search out; rather it is to understand rightly theauthoritative Word and the authorities proclaiming it. There-fore, the discussion of the words and doctrinal opinions of thevarious authorities takes precedence in the acquiring of knowl-edge in the Middle Ages. The componere scripta et sermones, theargumentum ex verbo,9 is decisive and at the same time is thereason why the accepted Platonic and Aristotelian philosophythat had been taken over had to be transformed into scholasticdialectic. If, now, Roger Bacon demands the experimentum---andhe does demand it---he does not mean the experiment of scienceas research; rather he wants the argumentum ex re instead of theargumentum ex verbo, the careful observing of things themselves,i.e., Aristotelian empeiria, instead of the discussion of doctrines.The modern research experiment, however, is not only anobservation more precise in degree and scope, but is a method-ology essentially different in kind, related to the verification oflaw in the framework, and at the service, of an exact plan ofnature. Source criticism in the historical humanistic sciences cor-responds to experiment in physical research. Here the name\"source criticism\" designates the whole gamut of the discovery,examination, verification, evaluation, preservation, and inter-pretation of sources. Historiographical explanation, which is

9\. \"The comparing of the writings with the sayings, the argument fromthe word.\" Argumentum ex re, which follows shortly, means \"argumentfrom the thing.\"

based on source criticism, does not, it is true, trace facts backto laws and rules. But neither does it confine itself to the merereporting of facts. In the historical sciences, just as in the natu-ral sciences, the methodology aims at representing what is fixedand stable and at making history an object. History can becomeobjective only when it is past. What is stable in what is past,that on the basis of which historiographical explanation reckonsup the solitary and the diverse in history, is the always-has-been-once-already, the comparable. Through the constant com-paring of everything with everything, what is intelligible isfound by calculation and is certified and established as theground plan of history. The sphere of historiographical researchextends only so far as historiographical explanation reaches. Theunique, the rare, the simple---in short, the great---in history isnever self-evident and hence remains inexplicable. It is not thathistorical research denies what is great in history; rather itexplains it as the exception. In this explaining, the great is meas-ured against the ordinary and the average. And there is no otherhistoriographical explanation so long as explaining means reduc-tion to what is intelligible and so long as historiography remainsresearch, i.e., an explaining. Because historiography as researchprojects and objectifies the past in the sense of an explicable andsurveyable nexus of actions and consequences, it requires sourcecriticism as its instrument of objectification. The standards ofthis criticism alter to the degree that historiography approachesjournalism.

Every science is, as research, grounded upon the projectionof a circumscribed object-sphere and is therefore necessarilya science of individualized character. Every individualized sciencemust, moreover, in the development of its projected plan bymeans of its methodology, particularize itself into specific fieldsof investigation. This particularizing (specialization) is, how-ever, by no means simply an irksome concomitant of the increas-ing unsurveyability of the results of research. It is not a nec-essary evil, but is rather an essential necessity of science asresearch. Specialization is not the consequence but the founda-tion of the progress of all research. Research does not, throughits methodology, become dispersed into random investigations,

124 The Question Concerning Technology

so as to lose itself in them; for modern science is determined bya third fundamental event: ongoing activity (Appendix 2).10

By this is to be understood first of all the phenomenon that ascience today, whether physical or humanistic, attains to therespect due a science only when it has become capable of beinginstitutionalized. However, research is not ongoing activity be-cause its work is accomplished in institutions, but rather insti-tutions are necessary because science, intrinsically as research,has the character of ongoing activity. The methodology throughwhich individual object-spheres are conquered does not simplyamass results. Rather, with the help of its results it adapts\[richtet sich . . . ein\] itself for a new procedure. Within the com-plex of machinery that is necessary to physics in order to carryout the smashing of the atom lies hidden the whole of physicsup to now. Correspondingly, in historiographical research, fundsof source materials become usable for explanation only if thosesources are themselves guaranteed on the basis of historio-graphical explanation. In the course of these processes, themethodology of the science becomes circumscribed by meansof its results. More and more the methodology adapts itself tothe possibilities of procedure opened up through itself. Thishaving-to-adapt-itself to its own results as the ways and meansof an advancing methodology is the essence of research\'s char-acter as ongoing activity. And it is that character that is theintrinsic basis for the necessity of the institutional nature ofresearch.

In ongoing activity the plan of an object-sphere is, for thefirst time, built into whatever is. All adjustments that facilitatea plannable conjoining of types of methodology, that further thereciprocal checking and communication of results, and that regu-late the exchange of talents are measures that are by no meansonly the external consequences of the fact that research workis expanding and proliferating. Rather, research work becomesthe distant sign, still far from being understood, that modernscience is beginning to enter upon the decisive phase of its his-

tory. Only now is it beginning to take possession of its owncomplete essence.

What is taking place in this extending and consolidating ofthe institutional character of the sciences? Nothing less than themaking secure of the precedence of methodology over whateveris (nature and history), which at any given time becomes objec-tive in research. On the foundation of their character as ongoingactivity, the sciences are creating for themselves the solidarityand unity appropriate to them. Therefore historiographical orarcheological research that is carried forward in an institution-alized way is essentially closer to research in physics that issimilarly organized than it is to a discipline belonging to itsown faculty in the humanistic sciences that still remains miredin mere erudition. Hence the decisive development of the moderncharacter of science as ongoing activity also forms men of adifferent stamp. The scholar disappears. He is succeeded by theresearch man who is engaged in research projects. These, ratherthan the cultivating of erudition, lend to his work its atmosphereof incisiveness. The research man no longer needs a library athome. Moreover, he is constantly on the move. He negotiatesat meetings and collects information at congresses. He contractsfor commissions with publishers. The latter now determine alongwith him which books must be written (Appendix 3).

The research worker necessarily presses forward of himselfinto the sphere characteristic of the technologist in the essentialsense. Only in this way is he capable of acting effectively, andonly thus, after the manner of his age, is he real. Alongside him,the increasingly thin and empty Romanticism of scholarshipand the university will still be able to persist for some time ina few places. However, the effective unity characteristic of theuniversity, and hence the latter\'s reality, does not lie in someintellectual power belonging to an original unification of thesciences and emanating from the university because nourishedby it and preserved in it. The university is real as an orderlyestablishment that, in a form still unique because it is admin-istratively self-contained, makes possible and visible the strivingapart of the sciences into the particularization and peculiar unitythat belong to ongoing activity. Because the forces intrinsic tothe essence of modern science come immediately and unequiv-

126 The Question Concerning Technology

ocally to effective working in ongoing activity, therefore, also,it is only the spontaneous ongoing activities of research thatcan sketch out and establish the internal unity with other likeactivities that is commensurate with themselves.

The real system of science consists in a solidarity of procedureand attitude with respect to the objectification of whatever is---a solidarity that is brought about appropriately at any given timeon the basis of planning. The excellence demanded of this systemis not some contrived and rigid unity of the relationships amongobject-spheres, having to do with content, but is rather thegreatest possible free, though regulated, flexibility in the shiftingabout and introducing of research apropos of the leading tasksat any given time. The more exclusively science individualizesitself with a view to the total carrying on and mastering of itswork process, and the more realistically these ongoing activitiesare shifted into separate research institutes and professionalschools, the more irresistibly do the sciences achieve the con-summation of their modern essence. But the more uncondition-ally science and the man of research take seriously the modernform of their essence, the more unequivocally and the moreimmediately will they be able to offer themselves for the commongood, and the more unreservedly too will they have to returnto the public anonymity of all work useful to society.

Modern science simultaneously establishes itself and differ-entiates itself in its projections of specific object-spheres. Theseprojection-plans are developed by means of a correspondingmethodology, which is made secure through rigor. Methodologyadapts and establishes itself at any given time in ongoing activ-ity. Projection and rigor, methodology and ongoing activity,mutually requiring one another, constitute the essence of modernscience, transform science into research.

We are reflecting on the essence of modern science in orderthat we may apprehend in it its metaphysical ground. Whatunderstanding of what is and what concept of truth provide thebasis for the fact that science is being transformed into research?

Knowing, as research, calls whatever is to account with regardto the way in which and the extent to which it lets itself be putat the disposal of representation. Research has disposal over

The Age of the World Picture 127

anything that is when it can either calculate it in its futurecourse in advance or verify a calculation about it as past. Nature,in being calculated in advance, and history, in being historio-graphically verified as past, become, as it were, \"set in place\"\[gestellt\].11 Nature and history become the objects of a repre-senting that explains. Such representing counts on nature andtakes account of history. Only that which becomes object in thisway is---is considered to be in being. We first arrive at science asresearch when the Being of whatever is, is sought in such objec-tiveness.

This objectifying of whatever is, is accomplished in a setting-before, a representing, that aims at bringing each particularbeing before it in such a way that man who calculates can besure, and that means be certain, of that being. We first arrive atscience as research when and only when truth has been trans-formed into the certainty of representation. What it is to be isfor the first time defined as the objectiveness of representing,and truth is first defined as the certainty of representing, in themetaphysics of Descartes. The title of Descartes\'s principal workreads: Meditationes de prima philosophia \[Meditations on FirstPhilosophy\]. Prote philosophia is the designation coined by Aris-totle for what is later called metaphysics. The whole of modernmetaphysics taken together, Nietzsche included, maintains itselfwithin the interpretation of what it is to be and of truth thatwas prepared by Descartes (Appendix 4).

Now if science as research is an essential phenomenon of themodern age, it must be that that which constitutes the meta-physical ground of research determines first and long before-hand the essence of that age generally. The essence of the mod-ern age can be seen in the fact that man frees himself from thebonds of the Middle Ages in freeing himself to himself. But

11\. The verb stellen, with the meanings to set in place, to set upon (i.e.,to challenge forth), and to supply, is invariably fundamental in Heidegger\'sunderstanding of the modern age. See in this essay the discussion of thesetting in place of the world as picture, p. 129. For the use of stellen tocharacterize the manner in which science deals with the real, see SR 167-168for a discussion in which stellen and the related noun Ge-stell serve cen-trally to characterize and name the essence of technology in this age, seeQT 14 ff.

128 The Question Concerning Technology

this correct characterization remains, nevertheless, superficial. Itleads to those errors that prevent us from comprehending theessential foundation of the modern age and, from there, judgingthe scope of the age\'s essence. Certainly the modern age has, asa consequence of the liberation of man, introduced subjectivismand individualism. But it remains just as certain that no agebefore this one has produced a comparable objectivism and thatin no age before this has the non-individual, in the form of thecollective, come to acceptance as having worth. Essential hereis the necessary interplay between subjectivism and objectivism.It is precisely this reciprocal conditioning of one by the otherthat points back to events more profound.

What is decisive is not that man frees himself to himself fromprevious obligations, but that the very essence of man itselfchanges, in that man becomes subject. We must understand thisword subiectum, however, as the translation of the Greekhypokeimenon. The word names that-which-lies-before, which,as ground, gathers everything onto itself. This metaphysicalmeaning of the concept of subject has first of all no special re-lationship to man and none at all to the I.

However, when man becomes the primary and only real sub-iectum, that means: Man becomes that being upon which allthat is, is grounded as regards the manner of its Being and itstruth. Man becomes the relational center of that which is as such.But this is possible only when the comprehension of what is asa whole changes. In what does this change manifest itself? What,in keeping with it, is the essence of the modern age?

When we reflect on the modern age, we are questioning con-cerning the modern world picture \[Weltbild\].12 We characterizethe latter by throwing it into relief over against the medievaland the ancient world pictures. But why do we ask concerninga world picture in our interpreting of a historical age? Does everyperiod of history have its world picture, and indeed in such away as to concern itself from time to time about that world

12\. The conventional translation of Weltbild would be \"conception ofthe world\" or \"philosophy of life.\" The more literal translation, \"worldpicture,\" is needed for the following of Heidegger\'s discussion; but it isworth noting that \"conception of the world\" bears a close relation toHeidegger\'s theme of man\'s representing of the world as picture.

The Age of the World Picture 129

picture? Or is this, after all, only a modern kind of representing,this asking concerning a world picture?

What is a world picture? Obviously a picture of the world.But what does \"world\" mean here? What does \"picture\" mean?\"World\" serves here as a name for what is, in its entirety. Thename is not limited to the cosmos, to nature. History also belongsto the world. Yet even nature and history, and both interpene-trating in their underlying and transcending of one another, donot exhaust the world. In this designation the ground of theworld is meant also, no matter how its relation to the world isthought (Appendix 5).

With the word \"picture\" we think first of all of a copy ofsomething. Accordingly, the world picture would be a painting,so to speak, of what is as a whole. But \"world picture\" meansmore than this. We mean by it the world itself, the world assuch, what is, in its entirety, just as it is normative and bindingfor us. \"Picture\" here does not mean some imitation, but ratherwhat sounds forth in the colloquial expression, \"We get thepicture\" \[literally, we are in the picture\] concerning something.This means the matter stands before us exactly as it stands withit for us. \"To get into the picture\" \[literally, to put oneself intothe picture\] with respect to something means to set whatever is,itself, in place before oneself just in the way that it stands withit, and to have it fixedly before oneself as set up in this way.But a decisive determinant in the essence of the picture is stillmissing. \"We get the picture\" concerning something does notmean only that what is, is set before us, is represented to us, ingeneral, but that what is stands before us---in all that belongsto it and all that stands together in it---as a system. \"To get thepicture\" throbs with being acquainted with something, withbeing equipped and prepared for it. Where the world becomespicture, what is, in its entirety, is juxtaposed as that for whichman is prepared and which, correspondingly, he therefore in-tends to bring before himself and have before himself, andconsequently intends in a decisive sense to set in place beforehimself (Appendix 6). Hence world picture, when understoodessentially, does not mean a picture of the world but the worldconceived and grasped as picture. What is, in its entirety, is nowtaken in such a way that it first is in being and only is in being

130 The Question Concerning Technology

to the extent that it is set up by man, who represents and setsforth.13 Wherever we have the world picture, an essential de-cision takes place regarding what is, in its entirety. The Beingof whatever is, is sought and found in the representedness ofthe latter.

However, everywhere that whatever is, is not interpreted inthis way, the world also cannot enter into a picture; there canbe no world picture. The fact that whatever is comes into beingin and through representedness transforms the age in which thisoccurs into a new age in contrast with the preceding one. Theexpressions \"world picture of the modern age\" and \"modernworld picture\" both mean the same thing and both assumesomething that never could have been before, namely, a medievaland an ancient world picture. The world picture does not changefrom an earlier medieval one into a modern one, but rather thefact that the world becomes picture at all is what distinguishesthe essence of the modern age \[der Neuzeit\].1\* For the MiddleAges, in contrast, that which is, is the ens creatum, that whichis created by the personal Creator-God as the highest cause.Here, to be in being means to belong within a specific rank ofthe order of what has been created---a rank appointed from thebeginning---and as thus caused, to correspond to the cause ofcreation (analogia entis) (Appendix 7). But never does the Beingof that which is consist here in the fact that it is brought beforeman as the objective, in the fact that it is placed in the realm ofman\'s knowing and of his having disposal, and that it is in beingonly in this way.

The modern interpretation of that which is, is even furtherfrom the interpretation characteristic of the Greeks. One of theoldest pronouncements of Greek thinking regarding the Beingof that which is runs: To gar auto noein estin te kai einai.15 Thissentence of Parmenides means: The apprehending of whateveris belongs to Being because it is demanded and determined by

13\. durch den vorstellenden-herstellenden Menschen gestellt ist.

14\. Die Neuzeit is more literally \"the new age.\" Having repeatedly usedthis word in this discussion, Heidegger will soon elucidate the meaning ofthe \"newness\" of which it speaks (pp. 130 ff.).

15\. The accepted English translation of this fragment is, \"For thought andbeing are the same thing\" (Nahm).

The Age of the World Picture 131

Being. That which is, is that which arises and opens itself, which,as what presences, comes upon man as the one who presences,i.e., comes upon the one who himself opens himself to whatpresences in that he apprehends it. That which is does not comeinto being at all through the fact that man first looks upon it,in the sense of a representing that has the character of subjectiveperception. Rather, man is the one who is looked upon by thatwhich is; he is the one who is---in company with itself---gathered toward presencing, by that which opens itself. To bebeheld by what is, to be included and maintained within itsopenness and in that way to be borne along by it, to be drivenabout by its oppositions and marked by its discord---that is theessence of man in the great age of the Greeks. Therefore, in orderto fulfill his essence, Greek man must gather (legein) and save(sozein), catch up and preserve,16 what opens itself in its open-ness, and he must remain exposed (aletheuein) to all its sunder-ing confusions. Greek man is as the one who apprehends \[derVernehmer\] that which is,17 and this is why in the age of theGreeks the world cannot become picture. Yet, on the other hand,that the beingness of whatever is, is defined for Plato as eidos\[aspect, view\] is the presupposition, destined far in advance andlong ruling indirectly in concealment, for the world\'s having tobecome picture (Appendix 8).

In distinction from Greek apprehending, modern representing,whose meaning the word repraesentatio first brings to its earliestexpression, intends something quite different. Here to represent\[vor-stellen\] means to bring what is present at hand \[das Vor-handene\] before oneself as something standing over against, torelate it to oneself, to the one representing it, and to force itback into this relationship to oneself as the normative realm.Wherever this happens, man \"gets into the picture\" in precedenceover whatever is. But in that man puts himself into the picturein this way, he puts himself into the scene, i.e., into the open

16\. \"Preserve\" translates bewahren. The verb speaks of a preserving thatas such frees and allows to be manifest. On the connotations resident inwahren and related words formed from wahr, see T 42 n. 9.

17\. The noun Vernehmer is related to the verb vernehmen (to hear, toperceive, to understand). Vernehmen speaks of an immediate receiving, incontrast to the setting-before (vor-stellen) that arrests and objectifies.

132 The Question Concerning Technology

sphere of that which is generally and publicly represented.Therewith man sets himself up as the setting in which whateveris must henceforth set itself forth, must present itself \[sich . . .prasentieren\], i.e., be picture. Man becomes the representative\[der Reprasentant\] of that which is, in the sense of that whichhas the character of object.

But the newness in this event by no means consists in thefact that now the position of man in the midst of what is, is anentirely different one in contrast to that of medieval and ancientman. What is decisive is that man himself expressly takes upthis position as one constituted by himself, that he intentionallymaintains it as that taken up by himself, and that he makes itsecure as the solid footing for a possible development of hu-manity. Now for the first time is there any such thing as a\"position\" of man. Man makes depend upon himself the wayin which he must take his stand in relation to whatever is as theobjective. There begins that way of being human which mansthe realm of human capability as a domain given over to meas-uring and executing, for the purpose of gaining mastery overthat which is as a whole. The age that is determined from outof this event is, when viewed in retrospect, not only a new onein contrast with the one that is past, but it settles itself firmly inplace expressly as the new. To be new is peculiar to the worldthat has become picture.

When, accordingly, the picture character of the world is madeclear as the representedness of that which is, then in order fullyto grasp the modern essence of representedness we must trackout and expose the original naming power of the worn-out wordand concept \"to represent\" \[vorstellen\]: to set out before oneselfand to set forth in relation to oneself. Through this, whateveris comes to a stand as object and in that way alone receives theseal of Being. That the world becomes picture is one and thesame event with the event of man\'s becoming subiectum in themidst of that which is (Appendix 9).

Only because and insofar as man actually and essentially hasbecome subject is it necessary for him, as a consequence, toconfront the explicit question: Is it as an \"I\" confined to its ownpreferences and freed into its own arbitrary choosing or as the\"we\" of society; is it as an individual or as a community; is it

The Age of the World Picture 133

as a personality within the community or as a mere groupmember in the corporate body; is it as a state and nation andas a people or as the common humanity of modern man, thatman will and ought to be the subject that in his modern essencehe already is? Only where man is essentially already subjectdoes there exist the possibility of his slipping into the aberrationof subjectivism in the sense of individualism. But also, onlywhere man remains subject does the positive struggle againstindividualism and for the community as the sphere of those goalsthat govern all achievement and usefulness have any meaning.

The interweaving of these two events, which for the modernage is decisive---that the world is transformed into picture andman into subiectum---throws light at the same time on thegrounding event of modern history, an event that at first glanceseems almost absurd. Namely, the more extensively and the moreeffectually the world stands at man\'s disposal as conquered, andthe more objectively the object appears, all the more subjectively,i.e., the more importunately, does the subiectum rise up, and allthe more impetuously, too, do observation of and teaching aboutthe world change into a doctrine of man, into anthropology. Itis no wonder that humanism first arises where the world becomespicture. It would have been just as impossible for a humanismto have gained currency in the great age of the Greeks as itwould have been impossible to have had anything like a worldpicture in that age. Humanism, therefore, in the more stricthistoriographical sense, is nothing but a moral-aesthetic anthro-pology. The name \"anthropology\" as used here does not meanjust some investigation of man by a natural science. Nor does itmean the doctrine established within Christian theology of mancreated, fallen, and redeemed. It designates that philosophicalinterpretation of man which explains and evaluates whatever is,in its entirety, from the standpoint of man and in relation toman (Appendix 10).

The increasingly exclusive rooting of the interpretation of theworld in anthropology, which has set in since the end of theeighteenth century, finds its expression in the fact that thefundamental stance of man in relation to what is, in its entirety,is defined as a world view {Weltanschauung). Since that timethis word has been admitted into common usage. As soon as

134 The Question Concerning Technology

the world becomes picture, the position of man is conceived asa world view. To be sure, the phrase \"world view\" is open tomisunderstanding, as though it were merely a matter here of apassive contemplation of the world. For this reason, already inthe nineteenth century it was emphasized with justification that\"world view\" also meant and even meant primarily \"view oflife.\" The fact that, despite this, the phrase \"world view\" assertsitself as the name for the position of man in the midst of allthat is, is proof of how decisively the world became picture assoon as man brought his life as subiectum into precedence overother centers of relationship. This means: whatever is, is con-sidered to be in being only to the degree and to the extent thatit is taken into and referred back to this life, i.e., is lived out,and becomes life-experience. Just as unsuited to the Greek spiritas every humanism had to be, just so impossible was a medievalworld view, and just as absurd is a Catholic world view. Just asnecessarily and legitimately as everything must change into life-experience for modern man the more unlimitedly he takes chargeof the shaping of his essence, just so certainly could the Greeksat the Olympian festivals never have had life-experiences.

The fundamental event of the modern age is the conquest ofthe world as picture. The word \"picture\" \[Bild\] now means thestructured image \[Gebild\] that is the creature of man\'s producingwhich represents and sets before.18 In such producing, man con-tends for the position in which he can be that particular beingwho gives the measure and draws up the guidelines for every-thing that is. Because this position secures, organizes, and articu-lates itself as a world view, the modern relationship to thatwhich is, is one that becomes, in its decisive unfolding, a con-frontation of world views; and indeed not of random worldviews, but only of those that have already taken up the funda-mental position of man that is most extreme, and have done

18\. Gebild is Heidegger\'s own word. The noun Gebilde means thingformed, creation, structure, image. Gebild is here taken to be close to it inmeaning, and it is assumed---with the use of \"structured\"---that Heideggerintends the force of the prefix ge\~, which connotes a gathering, to be foundin the word (cf. QT 19 ff.). \"Man\'s producing which represents and sets be-fore\" translates des vorstellenden Herstellens.

The Age of the World Picture 135

so with the utmost resoluteness. For the sake of this struggleof world views and in keeping with its meaning, man brings intoplay his unlimited power for the calculating, planning, andmolding of all things. Science as research is an absolutely neces-sary form of this establishing of self in the world; it is one ofthe pathways upon which the modern age rages toward ful-fillment of its essence, with a velocity unknown to the partici-pants. With this struggle of world views the modern age firstenters into the part of its history that is the most decisive andprobably the most capable of enduring (Appendix 11).

A sign of this event is that everywhere and in the most variedforms and disguises the gigantic is making its appearance. In sodoing, it evidences itself simultaneously in the tendency towardthe increasingly small. We have only to think of numbers inatomic physics. The gigantic presses forward in a form thatactually seems to make it disappear---in the annihilation of greatdistances by the airplane, in the setting before us of foreign andremote worlds in their everydayness, which is produced at ran-dom through radio by a flick of the hand. Yet we think toosuperficially if we suppose that the gigantic is only the endlesslyextended emptiness of the purely quantitative. We think toolittle if we find that the gigantic, in the form of continual not-ever-having-been-here-yet, originates only in a blind mania forexaggerating and excelling. We do not think at all if we believewe have explained this phenomenon of the gigantic with thecatchword \"Americanism\" (Appendix 12).

The gigantic is rather that through which the quantitative be-comes a special quality and thus a remarkable kind of greatness.Each historical age is not only great in a distinctive way in con-trast to others; it also has, in each instance, its own concept ofgreatness. But as soon as the gigantic in planning and calculatingand adjusting and making secure shifts over out of the quantita-tive and becomes a special quality, then what is gigantic, andwhat can seemingly always be calculated completely, becomes,precisely through this, incalculable. This becoming incalcu-lable remains the invisible shadow that is cast around all thingseverywhere when man has been transformed into subiectum andthe world into picture (Appendix 13).

136 The Question Concerning Technology

By means of this shadow the modern world extends itself outinto a space withdrawn from representation, and so lends to theincalculable the determinateness peculiar to it, as well as a his-torical uniqueness. This shadow, however, points to somethingelse, which it is denied to us of today to know (Appendix 14).But man will never be able to experience and ponder this that isdenied so long as he dawdles about in the mere negating of theage. The flight into tradition, out of a combination of humilityand presumption, can bring about nothing in itself other thanself-deception and blindness in relation to the historical moment.

Man will know, i.e., carefully safeguard into its truth,19 thatwhich is incalculable, only in creative questioning and shapingout of the power of genuine reflection. Reflection transports theman of the future into that \"between\" in which he belongs toBeing and yet remains a stranger amid that which is (Appendix15). Holderlin knew of this. His poem, which bears the super-scription \"To the Germans,\" closes:

How narrowly bounded is our lifetime,We see and count the number of our years.But have the years of nationsBeen seen by mortal eye?

If your soul throbs in longing

Over its own time, mourning, then

You linger on the cold shore

Among your own and never know them.20

19\. Wissen, d.h., in seine Wahrheit verwahren, wird der Mensch. . . .Here the verb wissen (to know), strongly emphasized by its placement inthe sentence, is surely intended to remind of science (Wissenschaft) withwhose characterization this essay began. On such knowing---an attentivebeholding that watches over and makes manifest---as essential to the char-acterizing of science as such, see 5R 180 ff.

20\. Wohl ist enge begrenzt unsere Lebenzeit,Unserer Jahre Zahl sehen und zahlen wir,Doch die Jahre der Volker,

Sah ein sterbliches Auge sie?

Wenn die Seele dir auch iiber die eigene Zeit

Sich die sehnende schwingt, trauernd verweilest du

Dann am kalten Gestade

Bei den Deinen und kennst sie nie.

APPENDIXES

1\. Such reflection is not necessary for all, nor is it to be ac-complished or even found bearable by everyone. On the otherhand, absence of reflection belongs to a very great extent tocertain definite stages of achieving and moving forward. Andyet the questioning belonging to reflection never becomes eithergroundless or beyond all question, because, in anticipation, itquestions concerning Being. Being is for it that which is mostworthy of questioning. Reflection finds in Being its most extremeresistance, which constrains it to deal seriously with whatever isas the latter is brought into the light of its Being. Reflection onthe essence of the modern age puts thinking and decision intothe sphere of effective working that belongs to the genuinelyessential forces of this age. These forces work as they will, be-yond the reach of all everyday valuation. In the face of theseforces, there is only a readiness for their decisive issue or, instead,an evasive turning away into the ahistorical. In this connection,however, it is not sufficient to affirm technology, for example, or,out of an attitude incomparably more essential, to set up \"totalmobilization\" as an absolute once it is recognized as being athand.21 It is a matter of constantly grasping in advance theessence of the age from out of the truth of Being holding sway

21\. Heidegger refers here to the central theme of Ernst Jiinger\'s \"DieTotale Mobilmachung/\' first published in 1931 as the preliminary sketch forhis monumental book Der Arbeiter \[The worker\] (Hamburg: HanseatischeVerlaganstalt, 1932). Originally, on the basis of his experience of WorldWar I, Jiinger sees \"total mobilization\" as the fundamental characteristic ofmodern warfare. Primarily a confrontation between man and technology,war shows itself to be a \"gigantic labor process\" (gigantischer Arbeitspro-zess). (See \"Die Totale Mobilmachung\" in Blatter und Steine \[Hamburg:Hanseatische Verlaganstalt, 1934\], p. 130.) In the evolution of Jiinger\'sthinking, the meaning of the term \"total mobilization\" extends itself todenote the phenomenon which for him is the essence of modern times:man\'s dominating of the earth by means of his technological will. \"The warfront and the labor front are identical\" (Der Arbeiter, p. 109). ViewingJiinger\'s thinking in the light of Nietzsche\'s, Heidegger understands \"totalmobilization\" as the final realization of the metaphysics of the will topower, or as the final phase of \"active nihilism.\" See The Question ofBeing \[Zur Seinsfrage\], trans.

within it; for only thus, simultaneously, is that which is mostworthy of questioning experienced, i.e., that which radicallycarries forward and constrains a creating into the future, outbeyond what is at hand, and lets the transformation of man be-come a necessity springing forth from Being itself. No age letsitself be done away with by a negating decree. Negation onlythrows the negator off the path. The modern age requires, how-ever, in order to be withstood in the future, in its essence and onthe very strength of its essence, an originality and range of re-flection for which we of today are perhaps preparing somewhat,but over which we certainly can never gain mastery.

2\. The phrase \"ongoing activity\" \[Betrieb\] is not intendedhere in a pejorative sense. But because research is, in essence,ongoing activity, the industrious activity of mere \"busyness\" \[desblossen Betriebs\], which is always possible, gives the impressionof a higher reality behind which the burrowing activity proper toresearch work is accomplished. Ongoing activity becomes merebusyness whenever, in the pursuing of its methodology, it nolonger keeps itself open on the basis of an ever-new accomplish-ing of its projection-plan, but only leaves that plan behind itselfas a given; never again confirms and verifies its own self-accumu-lating results and the calculation of them, but simply chases aftersuch results and calculations. Mere busyness must at all timesbe combated precisely because research is, in its essence, on-going activity. If we seek what is scientific in science solely inserene erudition, then of course it seems as though the disowningof practical activity also means the denying of the fact that re-search has the essential character of ongoing activity. It is truethat the more completely research becomes ongoing activity, andin that way mounts to its proper level of performance, the moreconstantly does the danger of mere industriousness grow withinit. Finally a situation arises in which the distinction between on-going activity and busyness not only has become unrecognizable,but has become unreal as well. Precisely this balancing out of theessential and the aberrant into the average that is the self-evidentmakes research as the embodiment of science, and thus makesthe modern age itself, capable of enduring. But whence does re-

The Age of the World Picture 139

search receive the counterpoise to the mere busyness within itsongoing activity?

3\. The growing importance of the publishing business is notbased merely on the fact that publishers (perhaps through theprocess of marketing their books) come to have the best ear forthe needs of the public or that they are better businessmen thanare authors. Rather their peculiar work takes the form of aprocedure that plans and that establishes itself with a view tothe way in which, through the prearranged and limited publica-tion of books and periodicals, they are to bring the world intothe picture for the public and confirm it publicly. The preponder-ance of collections, of sets of books, of series and pocket editions,is already a consequence of this work on the part of publishers,which in turn coincides with the aims of researchers, since thelatter not only are acknowledged and given consideration moreeasily and more rapidly through collections and sets, but, reach-ing a wider public, they immediately achieve their intended effect.

4\. The fundamental metaphysical position of Descartes istaken over historically from the Platonic-Aristotelian meta-physics and moves, despite its new beginning, within the samequestion: What is it to be?\* That this question, formulated inthis way, does not come to the fore in Descartes\'s Meditationsonly proves how essentially the change in the answer to it alreadydetermines the fundamental position. Descartes\'s interpretationof what it is to be and of truth first creates the presuppositionunderlying the possibility of a theory of knowledge or a meta-physics of knowledge. Through Descartes, realism is first putin the position of having to prove the reality of the outer world,of having to save that which is as such.

The essential modifications of the fundamental position ofDescartes that have been attained in German thinking sinceLeibniz do not in any way overcome that fundamental positionitself. They simply expand its metaphysical scope and create thepresuppositions of the nineteenth century, still the most obscure

\* Was ist das Seiende? Literally, \"What is being?\"

140 The Question Concerning Technology

of all the centuries of the modern age up to now. Indirectly thosemodifications confirm the fundamental position of Descartes ina form in which they themselves are almost unrecognizable,though they are not for that reason the less real. In contrast,mere Cartesian Scholasticism, with its rationalism, has lost allpower further to shape modern times. With Descartes begins thecompletion and consummation of Western metaphysics. And yet,because such a consummation is only possible once again asmetaphysics, modern thinking has its own greatness.

With the interpretation of man as subiectum, Descartescreates the metaphysical presupposition for future anthropologyof every kind and tendency. In the rise of the anthropologies,Descartes celebrates his greatest triumph. Through anthropologythe transition of metaphysics into the event of the simple stop-ping and setting aside of all philosophy is introduced. The factthat Dilthey disavowed metaphysics, that fundamentally he nolonger even understood its question and stood helpless beforemetaphysical logic, is the inner consequence of his fundamentalanthropological position. His \"philosophy of philosophy\" isan outstanding form of the anthropological abrogation---not theovercoming---of philosophy. This is why every anthropology inwhich previous philosophy is employed at will but is explainedas superfluous qua philosophy has the advantage of seeingclearly what is required along with the affirmation of anthro-pology. Through this, the intellectual situation finds some clari-fication, while the laborious fabrications of such absurd off-shoots as the national-socialist philosophies produce nothingbut confusion. The world view does indeed need and use philo-sophical erudition, but it requires no philosophy, since, as worldview, it has already taken over a particular interpretation andstructuring of whatever is. But one thing, surely, anthropologycannot do. It cannot overcome Descartes, nor even rise up againsthim, for how shall the consequence ever attack the ground onwhich it stands?

Descartes can be overcome only through the overcoming ofthat which he himself founded, only through the overcoming ofmodern, and that means at the same time Western, metaphysics.Overcoming means here, however, the primal asking of thequestion concerning the meaning, i.e., concerning the realm of

The Age of the World Picture 141

the projection or delineation, and thus concerning the truth, ofBeing---which question simultaneously unveils itself as thequestion concerning the Being of truth.

5\. The concept of world as it is developed in Being and Timeis to be understood only from within the horizon of the questionconcerning \"openness for Being\" \[Da-sein\], a question that, forits part, remains closely conjoined with the fundamental questionconcerning the meaning of Being (not with the meaning of thatwhich is).

6\. What belongs properly to the essence of the picture isstanding-together, system. By this is not meant the artificial andexternal simplifying and putting together of what is given, butthe unity of structure in that which is represented \[im Vor-gestellten\] as such, a unity that develops out of the projectionof the objectivity of whatever is. In the Middle Ages a systemis impossible, for there a ranked order of correspondences isalone essential, and indeed as an ordering of whatever is in thesense of what has been created by God and is watched over as hiscreature. The system is still more foreign to the Greeks, evenif in modern times we speak, though quite wrongly, of thePlatonic and Aristotelian \"systems.\" Ongoing activity in researchis a specific bodying-forth and ordering of the systematic, inwhich, at the same time, the latter reciprocally determines theordering. Where the world becomes picture, the system, and notonly in thinking, comes to dominance. However, where thesystem is in the ascendancy, the possibility always exists alsoof its degenerating into the superficiality of a system that hasmerely been fabricated and pieced together. This takes placewhen the original power of the projecting is lacking. The unique-ness of the systematic in Leibniz, Kant, Fichte, Hegel, andSchelling---a uniqueness that is inherently diverse---is still notgrasped. The greatness of the systematic in these thinkers liesin the fact that it unfolds not as in Descartes out of the subjectas ego and substantia finita, but either as in Leibniz out of themonad, or as in Kant out of the transcendental essence of finiteunderstanding rooted in the imagination, or as in Fichte out ofthe infinite I, or as in Hegel out of Spirit as absolute knowledge,

142 The Question Concerning Technology

or as in Schelling out of freedom as the necessity of every par-ticular being which, as such a being, remains determined throughthe distinction between ground and existence.

The representation of value is just as essential to the moderninterpretation of that which is, as is the system. Where anythingthat is has become the object of representing, it first incurs in acertain manner a loss of Being. This loss is adequately perceived,if but vaguely and unclearly, and is compensated for with corre-sponding swiftness through the fact that we impart value to theobject and to that which is, interpreted as object, and that we takethe measure of whatever is, solely in keeping with the criterionof value, and make of values themselves the goal of all activity.Since the latter is understood as culture, values become culturalvalues, and these, in turn, become the very expression of thehighest purposes of creativity, in the service of man\'s makinghimself secure as subiectum. From here it is only a step to makingvalues into objects in themselves. Value is the objectification ofneeds as goals, wrought by a representing self-establishingwithin the world as picture. Value appears to be the expressionof the fact that we, in our position of relationship to it, actto advance just that which is itself most valuable; and yet thatvery value is the impotent and threadbare disguise of the ob-jectivity of whatever is, an objectivity that has become flat anddevoid of background. No one dies for mere values. We shouldnote, for the sake of shedding light on the nineteenth century,the peculiar in-between position of Hermann Lotze, who at thesame time that he was reinterpreting Plato\'s Ideas as valuesundertook, under the title Microcosmos, that Attempt at an An-thropology (1856) which still drew sustenance for the nobilityand straightforwardness of its mode of thinking from the spiritof German idealism, yet also opened that thinking to positivism.Because Nietzsche\'s thinking remains imprisoned in value repre-sentation, he has to articulate what is essential for him in theform of a reversal, as the revaluation of all values. Only whenwe succeed in grasping Nietzsche\'s thinking independently ofvalue representation do we come to a standing-ground fromwhich the work of the last thinker of metaphysics becomes a task

The Age of the World Picture 143

assigned to questioning, and Nietzsche\'s antagonism to Wagnerbecomes comprehensible as the necessity of our history.

7\. Correspondence \[Die Entsprechung\], thought as the funda-mental characteristic of the Being of whatever is, furnishes thepattern for very specific possibilities and modes of setting thetruth of this Being, in whatever has being, into the work. Theart work of the Middle Ages and the absence of a world picturein that age belong together.

8\. But did not a sophist at about the time of Socrates dareto say, \"Man is the measure of all things, of those that are \[derseienden\], that they are, of those that are not, that they are not?\"Does this statement of Protagoras not sound as though Descarteswere speaking? Most importantly, is it not true that the Beingof whatever is, is grasped by Plato as that which is beheld, asidea? Is the relation to what is as such not for Aristotle theoria,pure beholding? And yet it is no more the case that this sophisticstatement of Protagoras is subjectivism than it is that Descartescould carry into execution nothing but the overturning of Greekthought. Certainly, through Plato\'s thinking and through Aris-totle\'s questioning a decisive change takes place in the interpre-tation of what is and of men, but it is a change that always re-mains on the foundation of the Greek fundamental experienceof what is. Precisely as a struggle against sophism and thereforein dependency upon it, this changed interpretation is so decisivethat it proves to be the end of Greek thought, an end that at thesame time indirectly prepares the possibility of the modern age.22This is why Platonic and Aristotelian thinking has been able topass for Greek thinking per se, not only in the Middle Ages butthroughout the modern age up to now, and why all pre-Platonicthinking could be considered merely a preparation for Plato. Itis because from long habituation we see Greek thinking througha modern humanistic interpretation that it remains denied to us

22\. The word \"end\" (Ende) should here be taken in its full sense of con-clusion, issue, aim, purpose.

144 The Question Concerning Technology

to ponder the Being that opened itself to Greek antiquity insuch a way as to leave to it its uniqueness and its strangeness.Protagoras7 statement runs: Panton chrematon metron estinanthropos, ton men onion hos estin, ton de me onton hos oukestin (cf. Plato, Theaetetus, 152)r:i

\"Of all things (those, namely, that man has about him incustomary use, and therefore constantly, chremata chresthai) the(particular) man is the measure, of those that presence, that theypresence as they presence, but also of those to which it remainsdenied to presence, that they do not presence/\' That which iswhose Being stands ready for decision is here understood asthat which presences of itself within this sphere, within thehorizon of man. But who is man? Plato gives details concerningthis in the same place, when he has Socrates say: Oukoun houtospos legei, hos hoia men hekasta emoi phainetai, toiauta menestin emoi, hoia de soi toiauta de au soi\' anthropos de su te kaiego:24 \"Does he (Protagoras) not understand this somewhat asfollows? Whatever at a given time anything shows itself to meas, of such aspect is it (also) for me; but whatever it shows itselfto you as, such is it in turn for you. You are a man as much asI.\"25

Man is here, accordingly, a particular man (I and you and heand she). And this ego is not supposed to coincide with the egocogito of Descartes? Never. For everything essential, i.e., thatwhich determines with equal necessity the two fundamental meta-physical positions in Protagoras and Descartes, is different in the

23\. Cornford translates: \"Man is the measure of all things-alike of thebeing of things that are and of the not-being of things that are not.\" Havinggiven his own translation of the quotation at the beginning of this para-graph, Heidegger now proceeds to give, at the beginning of the next, arendering of it that presents his thinking out of the thought of the Greekpassage in his own way.

24\. Cornford translates: \"He puts it in this sort of way, doesn\'t he?---thatany given thing \'is to me such as it appears to me, and is to you such as itappears to you,\' you and I being men.\"

25\. This is a literal translation of the German, as the latter is of theGreek. However, it is impossible in English to bring out one emphasis thatHeidegger himself gives. Following the Greek word order, he places als (as;Greek hos) at the beginning of the main clause in the sentence, in anatypical German construction. He is thus able to stress by a means notavailable in English the importance here of the appearance to the particularobserver.

two. What is essential in a fundamental metaphysical positionembraces:

1\. The manner and mode in which man is man, i.e., ishimself; the manner of the coming to presence \[Wesensart\]of selfhood, which is not at all synonymous with I-ness, butrather is determined out of the relation to Being as such

2\. The interpretation of the coming to presence \[Wesens-auslegung\] of the Being of whatever is

3\. The delineation of the coming to presence \[Wesensent-wurf\] of truth

4\. The sense in which, in any given instance, man ismeasure

None of these essential moments in a fundamental metaphysi-cal position may be understood apart from the others. Each onealways betokens, from the outset, the whole of a fundamentalmetaphysical position. Precisely why and in what respect thesefour moments sustain and structure in advance a fundamentalmetaphysical position as such is a question that can no longer beasked or answered from out of metaphysics and by means ofmetaphysics. It is a question that is already being uttered fromout of the overcoming of metaphysics.

To be sure, for Protagoras, that which is does remain relatedto man as ego. What kind of relation to the I is this? The egotarries within the horizon of the unconcealment that is meted outto it always as this particular unconcealment. Accordingly, itapprehends everything that presences within this horizon assomething that is. The apprehending of what presences isgrounded in this tarrying within the horizon of unconcealment.Through its tarrying \[das Verweilen\] in company with whatpresences, the belongingness of the I into the midst of whatpresences is. This belonging to what presences in the open fixesthe boundaries between that which presences and that whichabsents itself. From out of these boundaries man receives andkeeps safe the measure of that which presences and that whichabsents. Through man\'s being limited to that which, at any par-ticular time, is unconcealed, there is given to him the measurethat always confines a self to this or that. Man does not, fromout of some detached I-ness, set forth the measure to which

146 The Question Concerning Technology

everything that is, in its Being, must accommodate itself. Manwho possesses the Greeks\' fundamental relationship to thatwhich is and to its unconcealment is metron (measure \[Mass\])in that he accepts restriction \[Massigung\] to the horizon of un-concealment that is limited after the manner of the I; andhe consequently acknowledges the concealedness of what is andthe insusceptibility of the latter\'s presencing or absenting to anydecision, and to a like degree acknowledges the insusceptibilityto decision of the visible aspect of that which endures as pres-ent.26 Hence Protagoras says (Diels, Fragmente der Vorsokrati-ker: Protagoras B, 4): Peri men theon ouk echo eidenai, outh hoseisin, outh hos ouk eisin, outh hopoioi tines idean.27 \"I am surelynot in a position to know anything (for the Greek, to have any-thing in \'sight\') regarding the gods, neither that they are northat they are not, nor how they are in their visible aspect(idea).\"

Polla gar ta koluonta eidenai, he t\'adelotes kai brachus on hobios tou anthropou.28 \"For manifold is that which prevents theapprehending of whatever is as what it is, i.e., both the non-disclosedness (concealment) of what is and the brevity of man\'shistorical course.\"

Need we wonder that Socrates, considering Protagoras\' cir-cumspection, says of him, Eikos mentoi sophon andra me lerein:\"We may suppose that he (Protagoras), a sensible man, (in hisstatement about man as metron) is not simply babbling on.\"29

The fundamental metaphysical position of Protagoras is onlya narrowing down, but that means nonetheless a preserving, ofthe fundamental position of Heraclitus and Parmenides. Sophismis possible only on the foundation of sophia, i.e., on the founda-tion of the Greek interpretation of Being as presencing and oftruth as unconcealment---an unconcealment that itself remains anessential determination of Being, so that what presences is de-

26\. die Unentscheidbarkeit . . . tiber das Aussehen des Wesenden.

27\. \"As to the gods, I have no means of knowing either that they existor that they do not exist\" (Nahm).

28\. \"For many are the obstacles that impede knowledge, both the ob-scurity of the question and the shortness of human life\" (Nahm).

29\. Cornford translates: \"Well, what a wise man says is not likely to benonsense.\"

The Age of the World Picture 147

termined from out of unconcealment and presencing is deter-mined from out of unconcealedness in its particularity.30 But justhow far removed is Descartes from the beginning of Greekthinking, just how different is the interpretation of man thatrepresents him as subject? Precisely because in the concept of thesubiectum the coming to presence of Being as experienced bythe Greeks---the hypokeisthai of the hypokeimenon---still re-sounds in the form of a presencing that has become unrecogniz-able and unquestioned (namely, the presencing of that whichlies fixedly before), therefore the essence of the change in funda-mental metaphysical position is to be seen from out of thatcoming to presence of Being.

It is one thing to preserve the horizon of unconcealment thatis limited at any given time through the apprehending of whatpresences (man as metron). It is another to proceed into the un-limited sphere of possible objectification, through the reckoningup of the representable that is accessible to every man andbinding for all.

All subjectivism is impossible in Greek sophism, for here mancan never be subiectum; he cannot become subiectum becausehere Being is presencing and truth is unconcealment.

In unconcealment fantasia comes to pass: the coming-into-appearance, as a particular something, of that which presences---for man, who himself presences toward what appears. Man asrepresenting subject, however, \"fantasizes,\" i.e., he moves inimaginatio, in that his representing imagines, pictures forth,whatever is, as the objective, into the world as picture.

9\. How does it happen at all that that which is displays itselfin a pronounced manner as subiectum?1 and that as a conse-

30\. In this sentence Heidegger shows the wholly mutual relation that heenvisions between Being (Sein) and what is (Seiendes), i.e., between pres-encing and what presences, that each is forever determining and determinedby the other. Cf. \"The Onto-theo-logical Constitution of Metaphysics,\" inIdentity and Difference, trans. Joan Stambaugh (New York: Harper & Row,1969), pp. 61 ff., 128 ff.

31\. Here \"displays itself\" translates sich auslegt. Auslegen is usuallytranslated in these essays with \"to interpret.\" For Heidegger the interpret-ing accomplished in metaphysics is the correlate of the displaying of itselfin its Being vouchsafed by that which is.

148 The Question Concerning Technology

quence the subjective achieves dominance? For up to Descartes,and also still within his metaphysics, that which is, insofar asit is a particular being, a particular sub-iectum (hypo-keimenon),is something lying before from out of itself, which, as such,simultaneously lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualitiesand changing circumstances. The superiority of a sub-iectum(as a ground lying at the foundation) that is preeminent becauseit is in an essential respect unconditional arises out of the claimof man to a fundamentum absolutum inconcussum veritatis (self-supported, unshakable foundation of truth, in the sense of cer-tainty). Why and how does this claim acquire its decisiveauthority? The claim originates in that emancipation of manin which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revela-tional truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself thattakes its stand upon itself. Through this liberation, the essenceof freedom, i.e., being bound by something obligatory, is positedanew. But because, in keeping with this freedom, self-liberatingman himself posits what is obligatory, the latter can henceforthbe variously defined. The obligatory can be human reason andits law; or whatever is, arranged and objectively ordered fromout of such reason; or that chaos, not yet ordered and still to bemastered through objectification, which demands mastery in aparticular age.

But this liberation, although without knowing it, is always stillfreeing itself from being bound by the revelational truth in whichthe salvation of man\'s soul is made certain and is guaranteed forhim. Hence liberation from the revelational certainty of salvationhad to be intrinsically a freeing to a certainty \[Gewissheit\] inwhich man makes secure for himself the true as the known ofhis own knowing \[Wissens\]. That was possible only throughself-liberating man\'s guaranteeing for himself the certainty ofthe knowable. Such a thing could happen, however, only insofaras man decided, by himself and for himself, what, for him, shouldbe \"knowable\" and what knowing and the making secure of theknown, i.e., certainty, should mean. Descartes\'s metaphysicaltask became the following: to create the metaphysical founda-tion for the freeing of man to freedom as the self-determinationthat is certain of itself. That foundation, however, had not onlyto be itself one that was certain, but since every standard of

The Age of the World Picture 149

measure from any other sphere was forbidden, it had at thesame time to be of such a kind that through it the essence of thefreedom claimed would be posited as self-certainty. And yeteverything that is certain from out of itself must at the sametime concomitantly make secure as certain that being for whichsuch certain knowing must be certain and through which every-thing knowable must be made secure. The fundamentum, theground of that freedom, that which lies at its foundation, thesubiectum, must be something certain that satisfies the essentialdemands just mentioned. A subiectum distinguished in all theserespects becomes necessary. What is this something certain thatfashions and gives the foundation? The ego cogito (ergo) sum.The something certain is a principle that declares that, simul-taneously (conjointly and lasting an equal length of time) withman\'s thinking, man himself is indubitably co-present, whichmeans now is given to himself. Thinking is representing, setting-before, is a representing relation to what is represented (idea asperceptio).32

To represent means here: of oneself to set something beforeoneself and to make secure what has been set in place, as some-thing set in place. This making secure must be a calculating, forcalculability alone guarantees being certain in advance, and firmlyand constantly, of that which is to be represented. Representingis no longer the apprehending of that which presences, withinwhose unconcealment apprehending itself belongs, belongs in-deed as a unique kind of presencing toward that which presencesthat is unconcealed. Representing is no longer a self-unconcealingfor . . . ,M but is a laying hold and grasping of. . . . Whatpresences does not hold sway, but rather assault rules. Repre-senting is now, in keeping with the new freedom, a going forth---from out of itself---into the sphere, first to be made secure, of

32\. Perceptio is from the Latin percipere (per -1- capere), thoroughly tolay hold of. The idea, that which presents itself and is viewed directly, hasbecome the perceptio, that which is laid hold of and set in place and isthus known.

33\. das Sich-entbergen fur. . . . Sich-entbergen (self-unconcealing) mightbe very literally translated \"self-harboring forth.\" The verb speaks of thataccepting of bounds from out of which Greek man opened himself towardthat which presenced to him. See Appendix 8, pp. 143 ff. For a discussionof entbergen and other words formed on bergen, see QT 11 n. 10.

150 The Question Concerning Technology

what is made secure. That which is, is no longer that whichpresences; it is rather that which, in representing, is first set overagainst, that which stands fixedly over against, which has thecharacter of object \[das Gegen-standige\]. Representing is making-stand-over-against, an objectifying that goes forward and mas-ters.34 In this way representing drives everything together intothe unity of that which is thus given the character of object.Representing is coagitatio.

Every relation to something---willing, taking a point of view,being sensible of \[something\]---is already representing; it iscogitans, which we translate as \"thinking.\" Therefore Descartescan cover all the modes of voluntas and of affectus, all actionesand passiones, with a designation that is at first surprising:cogitatio. In the ego cogito sum, the cogitare is understood inthis essential and new sense. The subiectum, the fundamentalcertainty, is the being-represented-together-with---made secureat any time---of representing man together with the entity repre-sented, whether something human or non-human, i.e., togetherwith the objective. The fundamental certainty is the me cogitare--- me esse that is at any time indubitably representable andrepresented. This is the fundamental equation of all reckoningbelonging to the representing that is itself making itself secure.In this fundamental certainty man is sure that, as the representerof all representing,35 and therewith as the realm of all repre-sentedness, and hence of all certainty and truth, he is made safeand secure, i.e., is. Only because in the fundamental certainty (inthe fundamentum absolutum inconcussum of the me cogitare ---me esse), man is, in this way, necessarily represented-together-with; only because man who frees himself to himself belongsnecessarily within the subiectum of this freedom---only for thisreason can and must this man himself be transformed into anexceptional being, into a subject which, with regard to that whichtruly (i.e., certainly) is, which is primary,36 has preeminenceamong all subiecta. That in the fundamental equation of cer-tainty, and then again in the actual subiectum, the ego is nameddoes not mean that man is now being defined in terms of the I

34\. Das Vor-stellen ist vor-gehende, meisternde Ver-gegen-standlichung.

35\. Literally, \"as the one who sets-before all setting-before.\"

36\. das erste wahrhaft (d.h. gewiss) Seiende.

The Age of the World Picture 151

and egoistically. It means simply this: To be subject now be-comes the distinction of man as the thinking-representing being\[Wesen\]. The I of man is placed in the service of this subiectum.The certainty lying at the foundation of this subiectum is indeedsubjective, i.e., is holding sway in the essence of the subiectum-,but it is not egoistic. Certainty is binding for every I as such, i.e.,for every I as subiectum. In the same way, everything that in-tends to be established, through representing objectification, assecured and hence as in being, is binding for every man. Butnothing can elude this objectification that remains at the sametime the decision concerning what must be allowed to count asan object. To the essence of the subjectivity of the subiectum andto the essence of man as subject belongs the unconditional de-limiting forth \[Entschrankung\] of the realm of possible objecti-fication and the right to decide regarding objectification.37

Now it has also been clarified in what sense man as subjectintends to be and must be the measure and center of that whichis, which means of objects, of whatever stands-over-against. Manis now no longer metron in the sense of the restricting of hisapprehending to the encircling sphere, particularized at any giventime, of the unconcealment belonging to whatever presencestoward which each man presences at any given time. As subiec-tum, man is the co-agitatio of the ego. Man founds and confirmshimself as the authoritative measure for all standards of measurewith which whatever can be accounted as certain---i.e., as true,i.e., as in being---is measured off and measured out (reckonedup). Freedom is new as the freedom of the subiectum. In theMeditationes de prima philosophia the freeing of man to the newfreedom is brought onto its foundation, the subiectum. The free-ing of modern man does not first begin with the ego cogito ergo

37\. The noun Entschrankung is peculiar to Heidegger. Related nounsmean bounds or that which is enclosed. On the prefix ent-, as meaningforth or out, see QT 11 n. 10. Entschrankung expresses Heidegger\'s viewthat to set bounds is to free what is enclosed to be what it is (cf. QT 8).Heidegger is using the word in this context to point up the contrast betweenthe position of modern man and that of Greek man, who, far from settinglimits, \"accepts restriction to the horizon of unconcealment that is limited\[beschrankten\] after the manner of the I,\" and who, far from decidingabout what shall have being, \"acknowledges the concealedness of what isand the insusceptibility of the latter\'s presencing or absenting to any de-cision.\" See p. 146.

152 The Question Concerning Technology

sum, nor is the metaphysics of Descartes merely a metaphysicssubsequently supplied and therefore externally built onto thisfreedom, in the sense of an ideology. In the co-agitatio, repre-senting gathers all that is objective into the \"all together,/ ofrepresentedness. The ego of the cogitare now finds in the self-securing //together,/ of representedness, in con-scientia, itsessence. Conscientia is the representing setting together of what-ever has the character of object, along with representing man,within the sphere of representedness safeguarded by man. Every-thing that presences receives from out of this representednessthe meaning and manner of its presence \[Anwesenheit\]---namely,the meaning and manner of presence \[Praesenz\]---in repraesen-tatio. The con-scientia of the ego as the subiectum of the coagi-tatio determines, as the subjectivity of the subiectum that isdistinctive in this way, the Being of whatever is.

The Meditationes de prima philosophia provide the patternfor an ontology of the subiectum with respect to subjectivity de-fined as conscientia. Man has become subiectum. Therefore hecan determine and realize the essence of subjectivity, always inkeeping with the way in which he himself conceives and willshimself. Man as a rational being of the age of the Enlightenmentis no less subject than is man who grasps himself as a nation,wills himself as a people, fosters himself as a race, and, finally,empowers himself as lord of the earth. Still, in all these funda-mental positions of subjectivity, a different kind of I-ness andegoism is also possible; for man constantly remains determinedas I and thou, we and you. Subjective egoism, for which mostlywithout its knowing it the I is determined beforehand as subject,can be canceled out through the insertion of the I into the we.Through this, subjectivity only gains in power. In the planetaryimperialism of technologically organized man, the subjectivismof man attains its acme, from which point it will descend to thelevel of organized uniformity and there firmly establish itself.This uniformity becomes the surest instrument of total, i.e.,technological, rule over the earth.38 The modern freedom of sub-

The reader will recognize in this passage a close foreshadowing ofHeidegger\'s later characterization of the modern age as that wherein---underthe rule of Enframing as the essence of technology---everything that is, is,through man, being transformed into and set in order as nothing butstanding-reserve.

jectivity vanishes totally in the objectivity\' commensurate with it.Man cannot, of himself, abandon this destining of his modernessence or abolish it by fiat. But man can, as he thinks ahead,ponder this: Being subject as humanity has not always been thesole possibility belonging to the essence of historical man, whichis always beginning in a primal way, nor will it always be. Afleeting cloud shadow over a concealed land, such is the darken-ing which that truth as the certainty of subjectivity---once pre-pared by Christendom\'s certainty of salvation---lays over adisclosing event \[Ereignis\] that it remains denied to subjectivityitself to experience.

10\. Anthropology is that interpretation of man that alreadyknows fundamentally what man is and hence can never ask whohe may be. For with this question it would have to confess itselfshaken and overcome. But how can this be expected of anthro-pology when the latter has expressly to achieve nothing lessthan the securing consequent upon the self-secureness of thesubiectum?

11\. For now the melting down of the self-consummatingessence of-the modern age into the self-evident is being ac-complished. Only when this is assured through world viewswill the possibility arise of there being a fertile soil for Beingto be in question in an original way---a questionableness ofBeing that will open ample space for the decision as to whetherBeing will once again become capable of a god, as to whetherthe essence of the truth of Being will lay claim more primally tothe essence of man. Only there where the consummation of themodern age attains the heedlessness that is its peculiar greatnessis future history being prepared.

12\. \"Americanism\" is something European. It is an as-yet-uncomprehended species of the gigantic, the gigantic that is itselfstill inchoate and does not as yet originate at all out of the com-plete and gathered metaphysical essence of the modern age. TheAmerican interpretation \[Interpretation\] of Americanism bymeans of pragmatism still remains outside the metaphysicalrealm.

13\. Everyday opinion sees in the shadow only the lack oflight, if not light\'s complete denial. In truth, however, the shadowis a manifest, though impenetrable, testimony to the concealedemitting of light. In keeping with this concept of shadow, weexperience the incalculable as that which, withdrawn from repre-sentation, is nevertheless manifest in whatever is, pointing toBeing, which remains concealed.

14\. But suppose that denial itself had to become the highestand most austere revealing of Being? What then? Understoodfrom out of metaphysics (i.e., out of the question of Being, inthe form What is it to be?), the concealed essence of Being, denial,unveils itself first of all as absolutely not-having-being, as Noth-ing. But Nothing as that Nothing which pertains to the having-of-being is the keenest opponent of mere negating. Nothing is nevernothing; it is just as little a something, in the sense of an object\[Gegenstand\]; it is Being itself, whose truth will be given overto man when he has overcome himself as subject, and that meanswhen he no longer represents that which is as object \[Objekt\].

15\. This open between is the openness-for-Being \[Da-seiri\],the word understood in the sense of the ecstatic realm of therevealing and concealing of Being.

Science andReflection1

In keeping with a view now prevalent, let us designate the realmin which the spiritual and creative activity of man is carried outwith the name \"culture.\" As part of culture, we count science,together with its cultivation and organization. Thus science isranked among the values which man prizes and toward which,out of a variety of motives, he directs his attention.

But so long as we take science only in this cultural sense, we

1\. \"Reflection\" is the translation of the noun Besinnung, which meansrecollection, reflection, consideration, deliberation. The corresponding re-flexive verb, sich besinnen, means to recollect, to remember, to call to mind,to think on, to hit upon. Although \"reflection\" serves the needs of transla-tion best in this and other essays in this volume, the word has seriousinadequacies. Most importantly, reflection---from Latin reflectere, to bendback---intrinsically carries connotations uncomfortably close to those inHeidegger\'s use of vorstellen, to represent or set before, and could suggestthe mind\'s observing of itself. Moreover, reflection, like the other nounsavailable as translations of Besinnung, lacks any marked connotation ofdirectionality, of following after. The reader should therefore endeavor tohear in \"reflection\" fresh meaning. For Heidegger Besinnung is a recollect-ing thinking-on that, as though scenting it out, follows after what isthought. It involves itself with sense (Sinn) and meaning, and is at thesame time a \"calm, self-possessed surrender to that which is worthy ofquestioning.\" See below, pp. 180 ff; cf. What Is Called Thinking?, trans.Fred D. Wieck and J. Glenn Gray (New York: Harper & Row, 1968), pp.207 ff.

156 The Question Concerning Technology

will never be able to gauge the scope of its essence.2 This isequally the case for art. Even today we readily name these twotogether: \"art and science.\" Art also is represented as one sphereof cultural enterprise. But then we experience nothing of itsessence. Regarded in terms of its essence, art is a consecrationand a refuge in which the real bestows its long-hidden splendorupon man ever anew, that in such light he may see more purelyand hear mor\^ clearly what addresses itself to his essence.

Science is no more a cultural activity of man than is art. Scienceis one way, and indeed one decisive way, in which all that ispresents itself to us.

Therefore we must say: The reality within which man of todaymoves and attempts to maintain himself is, with regard to itsfundamental characteristics, determined on an increasing scaleby and in conjunction with that which we call Western Europeanscience.

When we ponder this ongoing event, it becomes evident that,in the Western world and during the eras of its history, sciencehas developed such a power as could never have been met withon the earth before, and that consequently this power is ulti-mately to be spread over the entire globe.

Is science, then, nothing but a fabrication of man that has beenelevated to this dominance in such a way as to allow us toassume that one day it can also be demolished again by the willof man through the resolutions of commissions? Or does agreater destiny rule here? Is there, ruling in science, still some-thing other than a mere wanting to know on the part of man?Thus it is, in fact. Something other reigns. But this other con-ceals itself from us so long as we give ourselves up to ordinarynotions about science.

This other is a state of affairs that holds sway throughout allthe sciences, but that remains hidden to the sciences themselves.

2\. \"Essence\" will be the usual translation in this essay for the nounWesen. Occasionally Wesen will be translated with \"coming to presence.\"The main argument of the essay is centrally concerned with the \"essence\"of science. In following the discussion, the reader should keep firmly inmind that for Heidegger the Wesen of science---as of anything \\vhatever---isnot simply what science is, but rather the manner in which it pursues itscourse through time, the manner in which it comports itself in its enduringas present. See QT 3 n. 1.

Science and Reflection 157

In order that this state of affairs may come into view for us,however, there must be adequate clarity about what science is.But how shall we come to know that? Most surely, it seems,simply by describing the scientific enterprise of our day. Sucha presentation could show how, for a long time, ever moredecisively and at the same time ever more unobtrusively, thesciences have been intersecting in all organizational forms ofmodern life: in industry, in commerce, in education, in politics,in warfare, in journalism of all kinds. To be acquainted withthis intersecting is important. In order to be able to give anexposition of it, however, we must first have experienced thatin which the essence of science lies. This may be expressed inone concise statement. It runs: Science is the theory of the real.

This statement intends to provide neither a ready definitionnor an easy formula. It contains nothing but questions. Theyemerge only when the statement is clarified. We must observefirst of all that the name \"science\" \[Wissenschaft\] in the state-ment \"Science is the theory of the real\" always refers exclusivelyto the new science of modern times. The statement \"Science isthe theory of the real\" holds neither for the science of the MiddleAges nor for that of antiquity. Medieval doctrina is as essentiallydifferent from a theory of the real as it is different when con-trasted with the episteme of the ancients. Nevertheless, theessence of modern science, which has become world-wide mean-while as European science, is grounded in the thinking of theGreeks, which since Plato has been called philosophy.

With these considerations, the revolutionary character of themodern kind of knowing is in no way being weakened. Quite tothe contrary, the distinctive character of modern knowing \[Wis-sens\] consists in the decisive working out of a tendency that stillremains concealed in the essence of knowing as the Greeks ex-perienced it, and that precisely needs the Greek knowing in orderto become, over against it, another kind of knowing.

Whoever today dares, questioningly, reflectingly, and, in thisway already as actively involved, to respond to the profundity ofthe world shock that we experience every hour, must not onlypay heed to the fact that our present-day world is completelydominated by the desire to know of modern science; he mustconsider also, and above all else, that every reflection upon that

158 The Question Concerning Technology

which now is can take its rise and thrive only if, through adialogue with the Greek thinkers and their language, it strikesroot into the ground of our historical existence. That dialoguestill awaits its beginning. It is scarcely prepared for at all, andyet it itself remains for us the precondition of the inevitabledialogue with the East Asian world.

But a dialogue with the Greek thinkers---and that means atthe same time with the Greek poets---does not imply a modernrenaissance of the ancients. Just as little does it imply a his-toriographical curiosity about that which meanwhile has indeedpassed, but which still could serve to explain some trends inthe modern world chronologically as regards their origins.

That which was thought and in poetry was sung at the dawnof Greek antiquity is still present today, present in such a waythat its essence, which is still hidden from itself, everywherecomes to encounter us and approaches us most of all wherewe least suspect it, namely, in the rule of modern technology,which is thoroughly foreign to the ancient world, yet neverthelesshas in the latter its essential origin.

In order to experience this presence \[Gegenwart\] of history,3we must free ourselves from the historiographical representationof history that still continues to dominate. Historiographicalrepresentation grasps history as an object wherein a happeningtranspires that is, in its changeability, simultaneously passingaway.

In the statement \"Science is the theory of the real\" there re-mains present what was primally thought, primally destined.4

We will now elucidate the statement from two points of view.Let us first ask, What does \"the real\" mean? And next, Whatdoes \"theory\" mean? At the same time our elucidation will showhow the two, the real and the theoretical, join one anotheressentially.

3\. The German noun Gegenwart means both \"presence\" and \"the pres-ent.\" It thus speaks of presence expressly in the present. In Was HeisstDenken? (Tubingen: Max Niemeyer Verlag, 1974), Heidegger writes: An-wesen und Anwesenheit heisst: Gegenwart. Diese meint das Entgegenweilen(very literally, \"Presencing and presence mean: present-time-presence. Thelatter means tarrying over against and toward\") (p. 141). Cf. What Is CalledThinking?, p. 234.

4\. Literally, \"that which was early thought, early destined.\" Cf. QT 31.

Science and Reflection 159

In order to make clear what the name \"real\" means in thestatement \"Science is the theory of the real,\" let us simplyconsider the word itself. The real \[das Wirkliche\] brings to ful-fillment the realm of working \[des Wirkenden\], of that whichworks \[wirkt\].5 What does it mean \"to work\"? The answer tothis question must depend on etymology. But what is decisive isthe way in which this happens. The mere identifying of old andoften obsolete meanings of terms, the snatching up of thesemeanings with the aim of using them in some new way, leadsto nothing if not to arbitrariness. What counts, rather, is for us,in reliance on the early meaning of a word and its changes, tocatch sight of the realm pertaining to the matter in questioninto which the word speaks. What counts is to ponder thatessential realm as the one in which the matter named throughthe word moves. Only in this way does the word speak, andspeak in the complex of meanings into which the matter that isnamed by it unfolds throughout the history of poetry andthought.

\"To work\" means \"to do\" \[tun\]. What does \"to do\" mean?The word belongs to the Indo-Germanic stem dhe; from this alsostems the Greek thesis: setting, place, position. This doing, how-ever, does not mean human activity only; above all it does notmean activity in the sense of action and agency. Growth also,the holding-sway of nature {physis), is a doing, and that in thestrict sense of thesis. Only at a later time do the words physisand thesis come into opposition, something which in turn onlybecomes possible because a sameness determines them. Physisis thesis: from out of itself to lay something before, to place ithere, to bring it hither and forth \[her- und vor-bringen\], that is,into presencing. That which \"does\" in such a sense is that whichworks; it is that which presence\*,6 in its presencing. The verb

Most literally, \"that which endures unto.\" Heideggerwrites elsewhere: Die deutsche Prciposition \"an\" bedeutet ursprunglichzugleich: \"auf\" und \"in\" (\"The German preposition an \[unto\] originallymeans simultaneously \'toward\' \[auf\] and \'into\' \[in\]\"). (Was Heisst Denken?,p. 143). There, in a discussion of presencing, he says: Wesen ist her-bei-,ist an-wesen im Streit mit dem ab-wesen (literally, \"Wesen \[enduring as

160 The Question Concerning Technology

\"to work\" understood in this way---namely, as to bring hitherand forth---names, then, one way in which that which presences,presences. To work is to bring hither and forth, whether some-thing brings itself forth hither into presencing of itself or whetherthe bringing hither and forth of something is accomplished byman. In the language of the Middle Ages our German wordwirken still means the producing \[Hervorbringen\] of houses,tools, pictures; later, the meaning of wirken is narrowed downto producing in the sense of sewing, embroidering, weaving.

The real \[Wirkliche\] is the working, the worked \\Wirkende,Gewirkte\]; that which brings hither and brings forth into pres-encing, and that which has been brought hither and broughtforth. Reality \[Wirklichkeit\] means, then, when thought suffi-ciently broadly: that which, brought forth hither into presencing,lies before; it means the presencing, consummated in itself, ofself-bringing-forth. Wirken belongs to the Indo-Germanic stemuerg, whence our word Werk \[work\] and the Greek ergon. Butnever can it be sufficiently stressed: the fundamental character-istic of working and work does not lie in efficere and effectus,but lies rather in this: that something comes to stand and to liein unconcealment. Even when the Greeks---that is to say, Aris-totle---speak of that which the Romans call causa efficiens, theynever mean the bringing about of an effect. That which consum-mates itself in ergon is a self-bringing-forth into full presencing;ergon is that which in the genuine and highest sense presences\[an-west\]. For this reason and only for this reason does Aristotlename the presence of that which actually presences7 energeiaand also entelecheia: a self-holding in consummation (i.e., con-summation of presencing). These names, coined by Aristotle forthe actual presencing of what presences, are, in respect to whatthey express, separated by an abyss from the later modernmeanings of energeia in the sense of \"energy\" and of entelecheiain the sense of \"entelechy\"---talent and capacity for work.

Aristotle\'s fundamental word for presencing, energeia, isproperly translated by our word Wirklichkeit \[reality\] only if we,

for our part, think the verb wirken \[to work\] as the Greeksthought it, in the sense of bringing hither---into unconcealment,forth---into presencing.8 Wesen \[to come to presence\] is thesame word as w\'dhren, to last or endure. We think presencing\[Anwesen\] as the enduring of that which, having arrived in un-concealment, remains there. Ever since the period followingAristotle, however, this meaning of energeia, enduring-in-work,has been suppressed in favor of another. The Romans translate,i.e., think, ergon in terms of operatio as actio, and they say,instead of energeia, actus, a totally different word, with a totallydifferent realm of meaning. That which is brought hither andbrought forth now appears as that which results from an operatio.A result is that which follows out of and follows upon an actio-.the consequence, the out-come \[Er-folg\]. The real is now thatwhich has followed as consequence. The consequence is broughtabout by the circumstance \[Sache\] that precedes it, i.e., by thecause \[Ursache\] (causa). The real appears now in the light ofthe causality of the causa efficiens. Even God is represented intheology---not in faith---as causa prima, as first cause. Finally,in the course of the relating of cause and effect,9 following-after-one-another is thrust into the foreground, and with it the elapsingof time. Kant recognized causality as a principle of temporalsuccession. In the latest works of Werner Heisenberg, the prob-lem of the causal is the purely mathematical problem of themeasuring of time. With this change in the reality of the real,however, is bound up something else no less essential. Thatwhich has been brought about \[das Erwirkte\], in the sense of theconsequent \[des Erfolgten\], shows itself as a circumstance thathas been set forth in a doing10---i.e., now, in a performing and

8\. her---ins Unverborgene, vor---ins Anwesen.

Sich herausstellen, in addition to serving simply as areflexive form with the meaning to put oneself out in place, means to be-come manifest, to turn out, to prove. The main component of the verbstellen (to set or place) is fundamental to all Heidegger\'s characterizing ofthat which is taking place in the modern age (cf. QT 15, AWP 129-130),while the prefix her- (hither) is regularly one of his primary vehicles forspeaking of a bringing into presencing. The use of herausstellen hereparallels that of her-vor-bringen above (p. 159); see also n. 21 below. Sichherausstellen will be translated hereafter with either \"to set itself forth\" or

executing. That which follows in fact and indeed from such adoing is the factual \[Tatsachliche\].11 The word \"factual\" todayconnotes assurance, and means the same thing as \"certain\" and\"sure.\" Instead of \"It is certainly so,\" we say \"It is in fact so,\"and \"It is really so.\" Nevertheless, it is neither an accident nora harmless caprice in the change in meaning of mere terms that,since the beginning of the modern period in the seventeenthcentury, the word \"real\" has meant the same thing as \"certain.\"

The \"real,\" in the sense of what is factual, now constitutes theopposite of that which does not stand firm as guaranteed andwhich is represented as mere appearance or as something thatis only believed to be so. Yet throughout these various changesin meaning the real still retains the more primordially funda-mental characteristic, which comes less often and differently tothe fore, of something that presences which sets itself forth fromout of itself.

But now the real presents itself in the taking place of conse-quences. The consequence demonstrates that that which pres-ences has, through it, come to a secured stand, and that itencounters as such a stand \[Stand\]. The real now shows itselfas object, that which stands over against \[Gegen-Stand\].

The word Gegenstand first originates in the eighteenth cen-tury, and indeed as a German translation of the Latin obiectum.There are profound reasons why the words \"object\" and \"ob-jectivity\" \[Gegenstandlichkeit\] took on special importance for

\"to exhibit itself,\" depending on the exigencies of the particular context inwhich it appears. The reader should keep in mind that the self-exhibitingof which the verb speaks is a self-setting-forth that involves a setting inplace. The importance of the latter nuance of meaning in sich herausstellenis shown by the fact that the verb\'s introduction here leads directly into adiscussion of the appearing of the real as object, as that which stands overagainst---a connection for the verb that will be found repeatedly in thesucceeding pages (see especially p. 163 below). Regrettably, none of thetranslations here employed can overtly suggest either the evocative forceor the wide-ranging kinship that sich herausstellen possesses in the Germantext.

Goethe. But neither medieval nor Greek thinking represents thatwhich presences as object. We shall now name the kind ofpresence belonging to that which presences that appears in themodern age as object: objectness \[Gegenstandigkeit\].12

This is first of all a character belonging to that which presencesitself. But how the objectness of what presences is brought toappearance and how what presences becomes an object for asetting-before, a representing \[Vor-stellen\], can show itself tous only if we ask: What is the real in relation to theory, and thusin a certain respect also in and through theory? We now ask inother words: In the statement \"Science is the theory of the real,what does the word \"theory\" mean? The word \"theory\" stemsfrom the Greek verb theorem. The noun belonging to it is theoria.Peculiar to these words is a lofty and mysterious meaning. Theverb theorem grew out of the coalescing of two root words,thea and homo. Thea (cf. theater) is the outward look, the aspect,in which something shows itself, the outward appearance inwhich it offers itself. Plato names this aspect in which whatpresences shows what it is, eidos. To have seen this aspect,eidenai, is to know \[wissen\]}\* The second root word in theorem,horao, means: to look at something attentively, to look it over,to view it closely. Thus it follows that theorem is thean horan,to look attentively on the outward appearance wherein whatpresences becomes visible and, through such sight---seeing---to

linger with it.14

tion from theorem and devotes itself to it the Greeks call biostlieoretikos, the way of life of the beholder, the one who looksupon the pure shining-forth of that which presences. In contrastto this, bios praktikos is the way of life that is dedicated toaction and productivity. In adhering to this distinction, however,we must constantly keep one thing in mind: for the Greeks, biostheoretikos, the life of beholding, is, especially in its purest formas thinking, the highest doing. Theoria in itself, and not onlythrough the utility attaching to it, is the consummate form ofhuman existence. For theoria is pure relationship to the outwardappearances belonging to whatever presences, to those appear-ances that, in their radiance, concern man in that they bring thepresence \[Gegenwart\] of the gods to shine forth. The furthercharacterization of theorem, i.e., that it brings the archai andaitiai of what presences before man\'s apprehension and powersof demonstration, cannot be given here; for this would require areflection on what Greek experience understood in that whichwe for so long have represented as principium and causa, groundand cause (See Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Bk. VI, chap. 2,1139 ff).

Bound up with the supremacy accorded theoria within Greekbios is the fact that the Greeks, who in a unique way thoughtout of their language, i.e., received from it their human exist-ence,15 were also able to hear something else in the word theoria.When differently stressed, the two root words thea and orao canread thea and 6ra. Thea is goddess. It is as a goddess thatAletheia, the unconcealment from out of which and in which thatwhich presences, presences, appears to the early thinker Par-menides.

obsolete, sense is the beholding that watches over truth.16 Ourold high German word wara (whence wahr, wahren, and Wahr-heit)11 goes back to the same stem as the Greek horao, ora, wora.

The essence of theory as thought by the Greeks, which isambiguous and from every perspective high and lofty, remainsburied when today we speak of the theory of relativity in physics,of the theory of evolution in biology, of the cyclical theory inhistory, of the natural rights theory in jurisprudence. Nonethe-less, within \"theory,\" understood in the modern way, there yetsteals the shadow of the early theoria. The former lives out ofthe latter, and indeed not only in the outwardly identifiable senseof historical dependency. What is taking place here will becomeclearer when now we ask this question: In distinction from theearly theoria, what is \"the theory\" that is named in the statement\"Modern science is the theory of the real\"?

We shall answer with the necessary brevity, since we shallchoose an ostensibly superficial way. Let us take careful notehow the Greek words theorem and theoria are translated into theLatin and the German languages. Deliberately we say \"words\"\[die Worte\] and not \"terms\" \[die Worter\], in order to emphasizethat, each time, in the coming to presence and holding-sway oflanguage, it is a destining that decides.

The Romans translate theorem by contemplari, theoria bycontemplatio. This translation, which issues from the spirit ofthe Roman language, that is, from Roman existence, makes thatwhich is essential in what the Greek words say vanish at a stroke.For contemplari means: to partition something off into a separatesector and enclose it therein. Templum is the Greek temenos,which has its origin in an entirely different experience from thatout of which theorem originates. Temnein means: to cut, todivide. The uncuttable is the atmeton, a-tomon, atom.

The Latin templum means originally a sector carved out inthe heavens and on the earth, the cardinal point, the region ofthe heavens marked out by the path of the sun. It is within this

region that diviners make their observations in order to determinethe future from the flight, cries, and eating habits of birds. (SeeErnout-Meillet, Dictionnaire etymologique de la langue latine (3),1951, p. 1202: contemplari dictum est a templo, i.e., loco qui abomni parte aspici, vel ex quo omnis pars videri potest, quernantiqui templum nominabant).18

In theoria transformed into contemplatio there comes to thefore the impulse, already prepared in Greek thinking, of alooking-at that sunders and compartmentalizes. A type of en-croaching advance by successive interrelated steps toward thatwhich is to be grasped by the eye makes itself normative inknowing. But even now the vita contemplativa still remains dis-tinct from the vita activa.

In the language of medieval Christian piety and theology, theabove-mentioned distinction gains still another sense. It contraststhe meditative-monastic life with the worldly-active one.

The German translation for contemplatio is Betrachtung \[viewor observation\]. The Greek theorem, to look attentively uponthe aspect of what presences, appears now as to observe orconsider \[Betrachten\]. Theory is the viewing, the observation,of the real. But what does observation mean? We speak of acontemplative viewing in the sense of religious meditation andintrospection. This kind of viewing belongs in the realm of thevita contemplativa just mentioned. We speak also of the viewingof a picture, in looking at which we find release. In such usage,the word Betrachtung \[view\] is close to beholding, and it stillseems to be of like meaning with the early theoria of the Greeks.And yet the \"theory\" that modern science shows itself to be issomething essentially different from the Greek theoria. Thus,when we translate \"theory\" by \"observation\" we are giving theword \"observation\" a different meaning, not an arbitrarily in-vented one, but rather the one from which it is originally de-scended. If we take seriously what the German Betrachtungmeans, we shall recognize what is new in the essence of modernscience as the theory of the real.

What does Betrachtung mean? Trachten \[to strive\] is the Latin

18\. \"Contemplari is derived from templum, i.e., from \[the name of\] theplace which can be seen from any point, and from which any point can beseen. The ancients called this place a templum.\"

Science and Reflection 167

tractate, to manipulate, to work over or refine \[bearbeiten\].19To strive after something means: to work one\'s way towardsomething, to pursue it, to entrap it in order to secure it. Ac-cordingly, theory as observation \[Betrachtung\] would be anentrapping and securing refining of the ieal. But this characteriza-tion of science would obviously have to run counter to science\'sessence. For after all, science as theory is surely \"theoretical.\"It spurns any refining of the real. It stakes everything on grasp-ing the real purely. It does not encroach upon the real in orderto change it. Pure science, we proclaim, is \"disinterested.\"

And yet modern science as theory in the sense of an observingthat strives after is a refining of the real that does encroach un-cannily upon it. Precisely through this refining it correspondsto a fundamental characteristic of the real itself. The real iswhat presences as self-exhibiting.20 But what presences showsitself in the modern age in such a way as to bring its presencingto a stand in objectness. Science corresponds to this holding-swayof presencing in terms of objects, inasmuch as it for its part, astheory, challenges forth the real specifically through aiming itsobjectness.21 Science sets upon the real.22 It orders it into place

19\. From this point Heidegger continues to use das Wirkliche (the real),but he begins to use forms of the verb arbeiten (to execute, to work, tofashion; \[intrans.\] to labor) to set forth the way in which modern science,in corresponding to the manner in which the real now presents itself asobject in a causal sequence, performs the doing that brings the real forthinto its presencing in the modern age. Thus arbeiten and its compounds---bearbeiten (to work over or refine), zuarbeiten (to work toward), umar-beiten (to work around or recast), herausarbeiten (to work out)---arejuxtaposed to wirken (to work), discussed above. It has not been possible toshow this juxtaposition in the translation. Indeed, the necessity of some-times translating the verbs formed around arbeiten with uses of the Englishverb \"work\" actually functions to obscure it altogether. Heidegger\'s usehere of verbs formed from arbeiten recalls his previous statement: \"Thatwhich has been brought about, in the sense of the consequent, shows itselfas a circumstance that has been set forth in a doing,---i.e., now, in a per-forming and executing\" (Das Erwirkte im Sinne des Erfolgten zeigt sich alsSache, die sich in einem Tun, d.h. jetzt Leisten und Arbeiten herausgestellthat) (p. 161).

20\. das sich herausstellende Anwesende.

21\. \"Challenges forth\" translates herausfordern (literally, demands outhither). The structural parallel between the verbs herausfordern and her-ausstellen bespeaks the correspondence between the refining of the realwrought by science as an executing and the real\'s \"working\" of itself.

22\. \"Sets upon\" translates stellen. On the meaning of this verb, see QT

to the end that at any given time the real will exhibit itself asan interacting network,23 i.e., in surveyable series of relatedcauses. The real thus becomes surveyable and capable of beingfollowed out in its sequences. The real becomes secused in itsobjectness. From this there result spheres or areas of objectsthat scientific observation can entrap after its fashion.24 En-trapping representation, which secures everything in that ob-jectness which is thus capable of being followed out, is the funda-mental characteristic of the representing through which modernscience corresponds to the real. But then the all-decisive work\[Arbeit\] that such representing performs in every science is thatrefining of the real which first in any way at all expressly worksthe real out into an objectness through which everything realis recast in advance into a diversity of objects for the entrappingsecuring.

The fact that what presences---e.g., nature, man, history,language---sets itself forth as the real in its objectness, the factthat as a complement to this science is transformed into theorythat entraps the real and secures it in objectness, would havebeen as strange to medieval man as it would have been dismay-ing to Greek thought.

Thus modern science, as the theory of the real, is not anythingself-evident. It is neither a mere construct of man nor somethingextorted from the real. Quite to the contrary, the essence ofscience is rendered necessary by the presencing of what pres-

15 n. 14. The use of herausstellen to characterize the manner in which thereal exhibits and sets itself forth in the modern age has already been noted(p. 161, n. 10). A variety of stellen verbs follow here in this discussion ofthe conduct of modern science as theory: nachstellen (to entrap), sicher-stellen (to make secure), bestellen (to order or command), feststellen (tofix or establish), vorstellen (to represent), umstellen (to encompass), er-stellen (to set forth), beistellen (to place in association with).

23\. \"Interacting network\" translates Ge-wirk. In isolating the prefix ge-in the ordinary noun Gewirk (web, texture, weaving), Heidegger would haveus hear, in accordance with his foregoing discussion, the more fundamentalmeaning of a gathering of that which works and is worked. Cf. the discus-sion of ge-, QT 19.

24\. \"Spheres or areas of objects\" translates Gebiete von Gegenstanden, aphrase that Heidegger employs only at this one point in the essay. HisGegenstandsgebiet, used frequently in the following pages, is translated as\"object-area\" to distinguish it from the nearly synonymous Gegenstands-bezirk, translated as \"object-sphere\" in AWP.

Science and Reflection 169

ences at the moment when presencing sets itself forth into theobjectness of the real. This moment remains mysterious, as doesevery moment of its kind. It is not only the greatest thoughtsthat come as upon doves\' feet; but at any given time it is thechange in the presencing of everything that presences that comesthus---and before all else.

Theory makes secure at any given time a region of the real asits object-area. The area-character of objectness is shown in thefact that it specifically maps out in advance the possibilities forthe posing of questions. Every new phenomenon emerging withinan area of science is refined to such a point that it fits into thenormative objective coherence of the theory. That normativecoherence itself is thereby changed from time to time. But object-ness as such remains unchanged in its fundamental characteris-tics. That which is represented in advance as the determiningbasis for a strategy and procedure is, in the strict sense of theword, the essence of what is called \"end\" or \"purpose.\" Whensomething is in itself determined by an end, then it is pure theory.It is determined by the objectness of what presences. Were ob-jectness to be surrendered, the essence of science would bedenied. This is the meaning, for example, of the assertion thatmodern atomic physics by no means invalidates the classicalphysics of Galileo and Newton but only narrows its realm ofvalidity. But this narrowing is simultaneously a confirmation ofthe objectness normative for the theory of nature, in accordancewith which nature presents itself for representation as a spatio-temporal coherence of motion calculable in some way or other inadvance.

Because modern science is theory in the sense described, there-fore in all its observing \[Be-trachten\] the manner of its striving-after \[Trachtens\], i.e., the manner of its entrapping-securing pro-cedure, i.e., its method, has decisive superiority. An oft-citedstatement of Max Planck reads: \"That is real which can bemeasured.\" This means that the decision about what may passin science, in this case in physics, for assured knowledge restswith the measurability supplied in the objectness of nature and,in keeping with that measurability, in the possibilities inherentin the measuring procedure. The statement of Max Planck is true,however, only because it articulates something that belongs to

170 The Question Concerning Technology

the essence of modern science, not merely to physical science.The methodology, characterized by entrapping securing, thatbelongs to all theory of the real is a reckoning-up. We shouldnot, of course, understand this term in the narrow sense of per-forming an operation with numbers. To reckon, in the broad,essential sense, means: to reckon with something, i.e., to take itinto account; to reckon on something, i.e., to set it up as anobject of expectation. In this way, all objectification of the realis a reckoning, whether through causal explanation it pursuesthe consequences of causes, whether through morphology itputs itself into the picture in precedence over objects, or whetherin its fundamental elements it secures and guarantees somecoherence of sequence and order. Mathematics also is not areckoning in the sense of performing operations with numbersfor the purpose of establishing quantitative results; but, on thecontrary, mathematics is the reckoning that, everywhere bymeans of equations, has set up as the goal of its expectationthe harmonizing of all relations of order, and that therefore\"reckons\" in advance with one fundamental equation for allmerely possible ordering.

Because modern science as the theory of the real depends onthe precedence that attaches to its method, therefore it must, asa securing of object-areas, delimit these areas over against oneanother and localize them, as thus delimited, within compart-ments, i.e., compartmentalize them. The theory of the real isnecessarily departmentalized science.

Investigation of an object-area must, in the course of its work,agree with the particular form and modification possessed at anygiven time by the objects belonging to that area. Such agreementwith the particular transforms the procedure of a branch ofscience into specialized research. Specialization, therefore, is inno way either a deterioration due to some blindness or a mani-festation of the decline of modern science. Specialization is alsonot merely an unavoidable evil. It is a necessary consequence, andindeed the positive consequence, of the coming to presence\[Wesen\] of modern science.

The delimiting of object-areas, the compartmentalizing of theseinto special provinces, does no\* split the sciences off from oneanother, but rather it first yields a border traffic between them

Science and Reflection 171

by means of which boundary areas are marked out. Those areasare the source of a special impetus that produces new formula-tions of questions that are often decisive. We know this fact.The reason for it remains enigmatic, as enigmatic as the entireessence of modern science.

We have, indeed, already characterized this essence by eluci-dating the statement \"Science is the theory of the real\" accord-ing to its two principal words. This happened in preparationfor our second step, which is to ask: What inconspicuous stateof affairs conceals itself in the essence of science?25

We shall notice this state of affairs the moment that, takingparticular sciences as examples, we attend specifically to what-ever is the case regarding the ordering---in any given instance---of the objectness belonging to the object-area of those sciences.Physics, which, roughly speaking, now includes macrophysicsand atomic physics, astrophysics and chemistry, observes nature(physis) insofar as nature exhibits itself as inanimate. In suchobjectness nature manifests itself as a coherence of motion ofmaterial bodies. The fundamental trait of the corporeal is im-penetrability, which, for its part, presents itself as a kind ofcoherence of motion of elementary objects. The elementary ob-jects themselves and their coherence are represented in classical

25\. \"State of affairs\" translates the noun Sachverhalt. Sachverhalt mightbe rendered very literally \"relating or conjoining of matters.\" Heidegger isdoubtless here using this word as he does elsewhere, at the outset of theintricate discussion in \"Time and Being\" (see On Time and Being, trans.Joan Stambaugh \[New York: Harper & Row, 1972\], p. 4, where the word istranslated \"matter at stake\") to point to the wholly singular and self-initiating bringing-to-pass (Ereignis)---not brought about by anything frombeyond itself and not bringing about anything as its consequence---thattakes place as and within Being itself, the bringing-to-pass that, preciselyas a disclosing, brings Being and man into their own at any given time ingiving them into their needed belonging to one another. Cf. T 45 ff; cf. also\"Time and Being,\" pp. 23 ff. Although \"Being\" is scarcely mentioned as suchin this essay and the word Ereignis is never used, the relating of Being---asthe Being of whatever is---to man, whose science works over the real, clearlyunderlies Heidegger\'s entire discussion and comes tellingly if hiddenly intoplay with this use of Sachverhalt and in the discussion that follows to theend of the essay. The same allusion as that in Sachverhalt lies in Heideg-ger\'s later discussion of that which is not to be gotten around that isintractable and inaccessible (das unzugangliche Unumgangliche); and itsounds somewhat more evidently in his mention of that which is worthy ofquestioning (das Fragwiirdige). Cf. AWP, Appendix 1, pp. 137-138.

172 The Question Concerning Technology

physics as geometrical point mechanics, in the physics of todayunder the headings \"nucleus\" and \"field.\" Accordingly, forclassical physics every state of motion of bodies that occupyspace is at any time simultaneously determinable---i.e., is pre-cisely calculable in advance, predictable---both as to position andas to velocity. In contrast to this, in atomic physics a state ofmotion may on principle only be determined either as to positionor as to velocity. Correspondingly, classical physics maintainsthat nature may be unequivocally and completely calculated inadvance, whereas atomic physics admits only of the guarantee-ing of an objective coherence that has a statistical character.

The objectness of material nature shows in modern atomicphysics fundamental characteristics completely different fromthose that it shows in classical physics. The latter, classicalphysics, can indeed be incorporated within the former, atomicphysics, but not vice versa. Nuclear physics does not permit it-self to be traced back to classical physics and reduced to it.And yet---modern nuclear and field physics also still remainsphysics, i.e., science, i.e., theory, which entraps objects belongingto the real, in their objectness, in order to secure them in theunity of objectness. For modern physics too it is a question ofmaking secure those elementary objects of which all other ob-jects in its entire area consist. The representing belonging tomodern physics is also bent on \"being able to write one singlefundamental equation from which the properties of all element-ary particles, and therewith the behavior of all matter whatever,follow.\"\*

This rough indication of a distinction between epochs withinmodern physics makes plain where the change from the one tothe other takes place:26 in the experience and determination ofthe objectness wherein nature sets itself forth. Nevertheless,what does not change with this change from geometrizing-classi-cal physics to nuclear and field physics is this: the fact that naturehas in advance to set itself in place for the entrapping securing

\* Heisenberg, \"Die gegenwartigen Grundprobleme der Atomphysik.\" SeeWandlungen in den Grundlagen der Naturioissenschaft (1948 ed.), 8 : 98.

26\. For the meaning of \"epoch,\" see T 43 n. 10.

Science and Reflection 173

that science, as theory, accomplishes. However, the way inwhich in the most recent phase of atomic physics even the objectvanishes also, and the way in which, above all, the subject-objectrelation as pure relation thus takes precedence over the objectand the subject, to become secured as standing-reserve, cannotbe more precisely discussed in this place.

(Objectness changes into the constancy of the standing-reserve,a constancy determined from out of Enframing. \[See \'The Ques-tion Concerning Technology/\'\] The subject-object relation thusreaches, for the first time, its pure \"relational,\" i.e., ordering,character in which both the subject and the object are suckedup as standing-reserves. That does not mean that the subject-object relation vanishes, but rather the opposite: it now attainsto its most extreme dominance, which is predetermined from outof Enframing. It becomes a standing-reserve to be commandedand set in order.)27

We are now considering the inconspicuous state of affairs thatlies in the holding-sway of objectness.

Theory identifies the real---in the case of physics, inanimatenature---and fixes it into one object-area. However, nature isalways presencing of itself. Objectification, for its part, is directedtoward nature as thus presencing. Even where, as in modernatomic physics, theory---for essential reasons---necessarily be-comes the opposite of direct viewing, its aim is to make atomsexhibit themselves for sensory perception, even if this self-exhibiting of elementary particles happens only very indirectlyand in a way that technically involves a multiplicity of inter-mediaries. (Compare the Wilson cloud chamber, the Geigercounter, the free balloon flights to confirm and identify mesons.)Theory never outstrips nature---nature that is already presenc-ing---and in this sense theory never makes its way around nature.Physics may well represent the most general and pervasive law-fulness of nature in terms of the identity of matter and energy;and what is represented by physics is indeed nature itself, butundeniably it is only nature as the object-area, whose objectnessis first defined and determined through the refining that is char-

27\. For this paragraph Heidegger uses brackets. The reference to QTis his.

174 The Question Concerning Technology

acteristic of physics and is expressly set forth in that refining.Nature, in its objectness for modern physical science, is only oneway in which what presences---which from of old has beennamed physis---reveals itself and sets itself in position for therefining characteristic of science. Even if physics as an object-areais unitary and self-contained, this objectness can never embracethe fullness of the coming to presence of nature. Scientific repre-sentation is never able to encompass the coming to presence ofnature; for the objectness of nature is, antecedently, only oneway in which nature exhibits itself. Nature thus remains for thescience of physics that which cannot be gotten around. Thisphrase means two things here. First, nature is not to be \"gottenaround\" inasmuch as theory never passes that which presencesby, but rather remains directed toward it. Further, nature isnot to be gotten around inasmuch as objectness as such preventsthe representing and securing that correspond to it from everbeing able to encompass the essential fullness of nature. It isthis, at bottom, that haunted Goethe in his abortive struggle withNewtonian physics. Goethe could not yet see that his intuitiverepresenting of nature also moves within the medium of object-ness, within the subject-object relation, and therefore in principleis not different from physics and remains the same metaphysicallyas physics. Scientific representation, for its part, can never de-cide whether nature, through its objectness, does not ratherwithdraw itself than bring to appearance the hidden fullness ofits coming to presence. Science cannot even ask this question,for, as theory, it has already undertaken to deal with the areacircumscribed by objectness.

In the objectness of nature to which physics as objectificationcorresponds, that which---in a twofold sense---is not to be gottenaround holds sway. As soon as we have once caught sight in onescience of that which is not to be gotten around and have alsoconsidered it somewhat, we see it easily in every other.

Psychiatry strives to observe the life of the human soul in itssick---and that means always simultaneously in its healthy---manifestations. It represents these in terms of the objectness ofthe bodily-psychical-spiritual unity of the whole man. At anygiven time human existence, which is already presencing, dis-plays itself in the objectness belonging to psychiatry. The open-

Science and Reflection 175

ness-for-Being \[Da-sein\] in which man as man ek-sists, remainsthat which for psychiatry is not to be gotten around.

Historiography, which ever more urgently is developing intothe writing of universal history, accomplishes its entrappingsecuring in the area that offers itself to its theory as history. Theword Historie (historein) \[historiography\] means to explore andmake visible, and therefore names a kind of representing. Incontrast, the word Geschichte \[history\] means that which takesits course inasmuch as it is prepared and disposed in such andsuch a way, i.e., set in order and sent forth, destined. Historio-graphy is the exploration of history. But historiographical ob-servation does not first create history itself. Everything \"his-toriographical/\' everything represented and established afterthe manner of historiography, is historical \[geschichtlich\], i.e.,grounded upon the destining resident in happening. But historyis never necessarily historiographical.

Whether history reveals itself in its essence only through andfor historiography or whether it is not rather concealed throughhistoriographical objectification remains for the science of his-tory something it cannot itself decide. This, however, is decided:In the theory of historiography, history holds sway as that whichis not to be gotten around.

Philology makes the literature of nations and peoples into theobject of its explanation and interpretation. The written word ofliterature is at any given time the spoken word of a language.When philology deals with language, it treats it in accordancewith the objective ways of looking at language that are estab-lished through grammar, etymology, and comparative linguistics,through the art of composition and poetics.

Yet language speaks without becoming literature and entirelyindependently of whether literature for its part attains to theobjectness with which the determinations of a literary sciencecorrespond. In the theory of philology language holds sway asthat which is not to be gotten around.

Nature, man, history, language, all remain for the aforemen-tioned sciences that which is not to be gotten around, alreadyholding sway from within the objectness belonging to them---remain that toward which at any given time those sciencesare directed, but that which, in the fullness of its coming to

176 The Question Concerning Technology

presence, they can never encompass by means of their repre-senting.28 This impotence of the sciences is not grounded in thefact that their entrapping securing never comes to an end; it isgrounded rather in the fact that in principle the objectness inwhich at any given time nature, man, history, language, exhibitthemselves always itself remains only one kind of presencing, inwhich indeed that which presences can appear, but neverabsolutely must appear.

That which is not to be gotten around, as characterized above,holds sway in the essence of every science. Is this, then, theinconspicuous state of affairs that we should like to bring intoview? Yes and no. Yes, inasmuch as that which is not to be gottenaround belongs to the state of affairs referred to; no, insofar aswhat is not to be gotten around, as mentioned above, of itselfalone still does not constitute that state of affairs. This is alreadyevident in the fact that what is not to be gotten around stillitself occasions a further essential question.

That which is not to be gotten around holds sway in theessence of science. Accordingly, it would have to be expectedthat science itself could find present within itself that which isnot to be gotten around, and could define it as such. But it isprecisely this that does not come about, and indeed becauseanything like it is essentially impossible. What is the basis forour knowing this? If the sciences themselves should at any timebe able to find at hand within themselves what is not to begotten around of which we are speaking, they would have be-fore all else to be in a position to conceive and represent theirown essence. But they are never in a position to do this.

Physics as physics can make no assertions about physics. Allthe assertions of physics speak after the manner of physics.Physics itself is not a possible object of a physical experiment.The same holds for philology. As the theory of language andliterature, philology is never a possible object of philologicalobservation. This is equally the case for every science.

Nevertheless, an objection could arise. Historiography, as ascience, has a history as do all the rest of the sciences. Thus thescience of history is able to observe itself in the sense of apply-

28\. durch ihr Vorstellen nie wra-stellen konnen.

Science and Reflection 177

ing its own method and thematic procedure to itself. To be sure.Through such observation, historiography grasps the history ofthe science that it itself is. But through doing this historiographynever grasps its essence as historiography, i.e., as a science. Ifwe want to assert something about mathematics as theory, thenwe must leave behind the object-area of mathematics, togetherwith mathematics\' own way of representing. We can neverdiscover through mathematical reckoning what mathematicsitself is.

It remains the case, then, that the sciences are not in a positionat any time to represent themselves to themselves, to set them-selves before themselves, by means of their theory and throughthe modes of procedure belonging to theory.

If it is entirely denied to science scientifically to arrive at itsown essence, then the sciences are utterly incapable of gainingaccess to that which is not to be gotten around holding sway intheir essence.

Here something disturbing manifests itself. That which in thesciences is not at any time to be gotten around---nature, man,history, language---is, as that which is not to be gotten around\[Unumgangliche\], intractable and inaccessible \[unzuganglich\]for the sciences and through the sciences.29

Only when we also pay heed to this inaccessibility of thatwhich is not to be gotten around does that state of affairs comeinto view which holds complete sway throughout the essenceof science.

But why do we call that which is inaccessible and not to begotten around the inconspicuous \[unscheinbare\] state of affairs?30

29\. Unumgangliche and unzuganglich are built on the stem of the verbgehen (to go). In this passage Heidegger uses several forms of gehen itself:eingehen (to arrive at), zugehen (to gain access to), gehen (to move), uber-gehen (to pass over). And subsequently das Ubergangene, translated with\"that which is passed over,\" will also be used. In most cases it has beenimpossible to translate these words so as to show the close connectionexisting among them. Hence this passage carries in the German a forcearising out of repetition, which the translation cannot reproduce. And itevinces, in that repetition, the interrelated unitariness of that about whichHeidegger is speaking.

30\. Unscheinbar means literally, \"not shining,\" \"not bright.\" The verb inthe sentence that follows here, auffalien, means not only to strike as strange,but first of all, to fall upon, to fall open. Heidegger clearly intends hat the

178 The Question Concerning Technology

The inconspicuous does not strike us as strange. It may be seen,yet without being particularly heeded. Does the state of affairsshown us in the essence of science remain unnoticed only be-cause we think too little and too seldom on the essence of science?That scarcely anyone could justifiably maintain. On the contrary,many evidences speak for the fact that, not only through physicsbut through all the sciences, there moves a strange restiveness.Before this, however, in past centuries of intellectual and scien-tific history in the West, attempts to delimit and define theessence of science have made themselves felt again and again.The passionate and incessant troubling over this is thereforeabove all a fundamental characteristic of modern times. How,then, could that state of affairs remain unheeded? Today wespeak of \"the crisis at the foundations\" of the sciences. Thatcrisis, in fact, touches only the fundamental concepts of theindividual sciences. It is in no way a crisis of science as such.Today science goes its way more securely than ever before.

That which is inaccessible and not to be gotten around, whichholds sway throughout the sciences and in that way renders theiressence enigmatic, is, however, something far more, i.e., some-thing essentially other, than a mere unsureness in the providingof fundamental concepts by means of which at any given timean area is placed in association with the sciences. Thus the res-tiveness in the sciences extends far beyond the mere precarious-ness of their fundamental concepts. We are restive in the sciencesand yet cannot say for what reason or to what end, despite multi-farious discussions about the sciences. Today we philosophizeabout the sciences from the most diverse standpoints. Throughsuch philosophical efforts, we fall in with the self-exhibiting thatis everywhere being attempted by the sciences themselves inthe form of synthetic resumes and through the recounting of thehistory of science.

But for all that, what is inaccessible and not to be gottenaround remains in inconspicuousness. Therefore the inconspicu-ousness of the state of affairs cannot lie only in the fact that it

meanings that the translation here displays should be heard as primary inthese two words at this point. But at the same time both also containconnotations of self-manifestation, which he will bring out as the discus-sion proceeds.

Science and Reflection 179

does not astound us and that we do not notice it. The incon-spicuousness of the state of affairs, its failure to shine forth, isgrounded rather in the fact that it, of itself, does not come toappearance. The fact that that which is inaccessible and not to begotten around is continually passed over depends on it itself assuch. Inasmuch as such inconspicuousness is a fundamentalcharacteristic of the aforementioned state of affairs itself, thelatter is defined adequately only when we say:

The state of affairs that holds sway throughout the essenceof science, i.e., throughout the theory of the real, is that which isinaccessible and not to be gotten around, which is constantlypassed over.31

The inconspicuous state of affairs conceals itself in the sciences.But it does not lie in them as an apple lies in a basket. Ratherwe must say: The sciences, for their part, lie in the incon-spicuous state of affairs as the river lies in its source.

Our aim was to point to that state of affairs, in order that ititself might beckon us into the region from out of which stemsthe essence of science.

What have we achieved? We have become attentive to thatwhich is inaccessible and not to be gotten around, which is con-stantly passed over. It shows itself to us in \[an\] the objectnessinto which the real sets itself forth and through whose whole ex-tent theory entraps objects in order, for the sake of representa-tion, to secure those objects and their coherence in the object-areaof a particular science at a particular time. The inconspicuousstate of affairs holds sway throughout the objectness in which thereality of the real as well as the theory of the real moves freely,and in which consequently the entire essence, the coming to pres-ence, of the modern science of this new era moves freely also.

We shall be satisfied with having pointed to the inconspicuousstate of affairs. To bring out what it is in itself would requirethat we pose further questions. Through this pointing to the in-conspicuous state of affairs we are, however, directed onto away that brings us before that which is worthy of questioning.In contradistinction to all that is merely questionable, as well asto everything that is \"without question,\" that which is worthy

31\. das stets ubergangene unzugangliche Unumgangliche.

180 The Question Concerning Technology

of questioning alone affords, from out of itself, the clear impetusand untrammeled pause through which we are able to call towardus and call near that which addresses itself to our essence.32Traveling in the direction that is a way toward that which isworthy of questioning is not adventure but homecoming.

To follow a direction that is the way that something has, ofitself, already taken is called, in our language, sinnan, sinnen \[tosense\]. To venture after sense or meaning \[Sinn\] is the essenceof reflecting \[Besinnen\]. This means more than a mere makingconscious of something. We do not yet have reflection when wehave only consciousness. Reflection is more. It is calm, self-possessed surrender to that which is worthy of questioning.

Through reflection so understood we actually arrive at theplace where, without having experienced it and without havingseen penetratingly into it, we have long been sojourning. Inreflection we gain access to a place from out of which there firstopens the space traversed at any given time by all our doing andleaving undone.

Reflection is of a different essence from the making consciousand the knowing that belong to science; it is of a differentessence also from intellectual cultivation \[Bildung\], The wordbilden \[to form or cultivate\] means first: to set up a preformedmodel \[Vor-bild\] and to set forth a preestablished rule \[Vor-schrift\]. It means, further, to give form to inherent tendencies.Intellectual cultivation brings before man a model in the lightof which he shapes and improves all that he does. Cultivatingthe intellect requires a guiding image rendered secure in advance,as well as a standing-ground fortified on all sides. The puttingforward of a common ideal of culture and the rule of that idealpresuppose a situation and bearing of man that is not in questionand that is secured in every direction. This presupposition, forits part, must be based on a belief in the invincible power of animmutable reason and its principles.

As over against this, reflection first brings us onto the way

32\. In this sentence the reader will recognize, although in a very differentguise, a portrayal much like that which Heidegger gives in \"The Turning\"of the manifesting, freeing, restoring, that may take place from within andfor Being---as the Being of whatever is---and for man in the coming topresence of modern technology.

Science and Reflection 181

toward the place of our sojourning. This sojourning is constantlya historical sojourning---i.e., one allotted to us---no matterwhether we represent, analyze, and classify it historiographicallyor whether we believe that we can artificially detach ourselvesfrom history by means of a merely voluntary turning away fromhistoriography.

How and by what means our historical sojourn adds to andenlarges the dwelling proper to it33---about this, reflection candecide nothing directly.

The age of intellectual cultivation is coming to an end, notbecause the uncultured are gaining the ascendancy, but becausethe signs are appearing of a world-age in which that which isworthy of questioning will someday again open the door thatleads to what is essential in all things and in all destinings.

We will respond to the claim from afar, to the claim of theprevailing demeanor \[des Verhaltens\] of that world-age, whenwe begin to reflect by venturing onto the way already taken bythat state of affairs \[Sachverhalt\] which shows itself to us in theessence of science---though not only there.

Nevertheless, reflection remains more provisional, more for-bearing and poorer in relation to its age than is the intellectualcultivation that was fostered earlier. Still, the poverty of reflec-tion is the promise of a wealth whose treasures glow in theresplendence of that uselessness which can never be included inany reckoning.

The ways of reflection constantly change, ever according tothe place on the way at which a path begins, ever accordingto the portion of the way that it traverses, ever according to thedistant view that opens along the way into that which is worthyof questioning.

In usingbauen in these compounds (anbaut, \"adds to\"; ausbaut, \"enlarges\") in themidst of his juxtaposing of intellectual cultivation and reflection, Heideggerundoubtedly intends that bauen point up that contrast---an intention thathas been impossible to preserve in the translation.

man pursuing a way through a science, can move, as a thinkingbeing,34 on various levels of reflection and can keep reflectionvigilant.

Yet even there where once, through a special favor, the highestlevel of reflection might be attained, reflection would have to becontent only with preparing a readiness for the exhortation andconsolation that our human race today needs.

Reflection is not needed, however, in order that it may removesome chance perplexity or break down an antipathy to thinking.Reflection is needed as a responding that forgets itself in theclarity of ceaseless questioning away at the inexhaustibleness ofThat which is worthy of questioning---of That from out of which,in the moment properly its own, responding loses the characterof questioning and becomes simply saying.

The QuestionConcerning Technology

and Other Essays

\"To read Heidegger is to set out on an adventure. The essays inthis volume ---intriguing, challenging, and often baffling to thereader---call him always to abandon all superficial scanning andto enter wholeheartedly into the serious pursuit of thinking. . . .

\"Heidegger is not a \'primitive\' or a \'romantic\' He is not one whoseeks escape from the burdens and responsibilities of contempo-rary life into serenity, either through the re-creating of some idyllicpast or through the exalting of some simple experience. Finally,Heidegger is not a foe of technology and science. He neither dis-dains nor rejects them as though they were only destructive ofhuman life.

\"The roots of Heidegger\'s thinking lie deep in the Western philo-sophical tradition. Yet that thinking is unique in many of its aspects,in its language, and in its literary expression. In the developmentof this thought Heidegger has been taught chiefly by the Greeks,by German idealism, by phenomenology, and by the scholastictheological tradition. In him these and other elements have beenfused by his genius of sensitivity and intellect into a very individualphilosophical expression.\"
