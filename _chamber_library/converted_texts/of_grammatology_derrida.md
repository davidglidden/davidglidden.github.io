I thank Angelo Bertocci for having given me the idea for this
translation. I thank Paul de Man for his patient and penetrating
criticism of the Translator's Preface and the text, at a time when his
own schedule was so thoroughly besieged. I thank J. Hillis Miller for
his advice, his active encouragement, and his acute comments on the
Translator's Preface. I owe him particular thanks[]{#calibre_link-1238}
for having introduced me to Derrida himself after I had been working on
this book for a year. I am grateful to John Brenkmen, Leone Stein, and
Paul M. Wright for their support during the early stages of the work. In
the preparation of the translation, I have been particularly helped by
four painstaking and indefatigable bilingual readers: Jessie L. Hornsby,
Dori Katz, Richard Laden, Talbot Spivak.[]{#calibre_link-1239} Pierre de
Saint-Victor, the late Alexander Aspel, Jacques Bourgeacq and Donald
Jackson untied occasional knots. To all of them, a considerable debt of
gratitude is due. (The whole book is a gift for Talbot Spivak.) I thank
also the Carver Foundation at the University of Iowa for making it
possible for me to go to France in the summer of 1973 to discuss this
book with Jacques Derrida. To Robert[]{#calibre_link-1240} Scholes I am
grateful for having made it possible for me to teach a seminar on
Derrida at Brown University in the fall of 1974--75. At that seminar,
especially through active exchange with Bella Brodzky and Tom Claire, I
staked out the ground for my Preface.

I am grateful to Peter Bacon for typing the first half of the manuscript
and the Preface from sometimes indecipherable copy. Pauline
Grimson[]{#calibre_link-1241} not only typed the rest, but always
delivered material at very short notice without complaint, and
conscientiously copy-edited my pages. I believe she came to feel a
personal responsibility for the making of this book, and for that I am
most grateful. I thank Timothy Shipe for his able assistance.

Without Dominick Franco, my research assistant, the manuscript would not
have gone to press. Michael[]{#calibre_link-1242} Ryan criticized each
version of the Translator's Preface with a sharp and inspired eye and
helped untiringly with library materials. I cannot thank him enough for
his incredibly meticulous and informed reading of the final proofs. And
Catty, indifferent yet devoted companion through a season of solitary
labor.

I am grateful to *Grammatology* for having brought me the friendship of
Marguerite and[]{#calibre_link-1243} Jacques Derrida.

*Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak*[]{#calibre_link-1244}

## []{#calibre_link-863 .calibre3}***Translator's Preface*** {#calibre_link-6 .h1}

If you have been reading Derrida, you will know that a plausible gesture
would be to begin with a consideration of "the question of the preface."
But I write in the hope that for at least some of the readers of this
volume Derrida is new; and therefore take it for granted that, for the
moment, an introduction can be made.

Jacques Derrida is maître-assistant in philosophy[]{#calibre_link-1247}
at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. He was born forty-five years
ago of Sephardic Jewish parents in
Algiers.^[]{#calibre_link-467}[1](#calibre_link-55){.nounder}^ At
nineteen, he came to France as a student. He was at Harvard on a
scholarship in 1956--57. In the sixties he was among the young
intellectuals writing for the avant-garde journal *Tel
Quel.^[]{#calibre_link-468}[2](#calibre_link-56){.nounder}^* He is now
associated with GREPH (Groupe de Recherche de l'Enseignement
Philosophique)---a student[]{#calibre_link-1248} movement that engages
itself with the problems of the institutional teaching of philosophy. He
was for a time a visiting professor on a regular basis at the Johns
Hopkins University, and now occupies a similar position at Yale. He has
an affection for some of the intellectual centers of the Eastern
seaboard---Cambridge, New York, Baltimore---in his vocabulary,
"America." And it seems that at first[]{#calibre_link-1249} these places
and now more and more of the intellectual centers all over the United
States are returning his affection.

Derrida's first book was a translation of Edmund Husserl's "Origin of
Geometry," with a long critical introduction. This was followed by *La
voix et le phénomène*, a critique of Husserl's theory of meaning. In
between appeared a collection of essays entitled *L'écriture et la
différence.[]{#calibre_link-1250} De la grammatologie* came next,
followed by two more collections---La *dissémination* and *Marges de la
philosophie*. There was a little noticed introduction to the *Essai sur
l'origine des connaissances humaines* by Condillac, entitled
"L'archéologie du frivole," and *Positions*, a collection of interviews.
This year his monumental *Glas* has
appeared.^[]{#calibre_link-469}[3](#calibre_link-57){.nounder}^

Jacques Derrida is also this collection of texts.

[]{#calibre_link-1251}In an essay on the "Preface" to Hegel's
*Phenomenology of the Mind*, Jean Hyppolite writes:

[]{#calibre_link-1252}When Hegel had finished the *Phenomenology* ... he
reflected retrospectively on his philosophic enterprise and wrote the
"Preface." ... It is a strange demonstration, for he says above all,
"Don't take me seriously in a preface. The real philosophical work is
what I have just written, the *Phenomenology of the
Mind*[]{#calibre_link-1253}. And if I speak to you outside of what I
have written, these marginal comments cannot have the value of the work
itself. ... Don't take a preface seriously. The preface announces a
project and a project is nothing until it is
realized."^[]{#calibre_link-470}[4](#calibre_link-58){.nounder}^

It is clear that, as it is commonly understood, the preface harbors a
lie. "Prae-fatio" is "a saying before-hand" (Oxford English
Dictionary---OED). Yet it is accepted[]{#calibre_link-1254} as natural
by Hyppolite, as indeed by all of us, that "Hegel reflected
*retrospectively* on his philosophic enterprise and wrote his
'Preface'." We may see this as no more than the tacit acceptance of a
fiction. We think of the Preface, however, not as a literary, but as an
expository exercise. It "involves a norm of truth," although it might
well be the insertion of an obvious fiction into an
ostensibly[]{#calibre_link-1255} "true" discourse. (Of course, when the
preface is being written by someone other than the author, the situation
is yet further complicated. A pretense at writing *before* a text that
one must have read *before* the preface can be written. Writing a
postface would not really be different---but that argument can only be
grasped at the end of this preface.)

Hegel's own objection to the Preface seems grave.[]{#calibre_link-1256}
The contrast between abstract generality and the self-moving *activity*
of cognition appears to be structured like the contrast between preface
and text. The method of philosophy is the structure of knowing, an
activity of consciousness that moves of itself; this activity, the
method of philosophical discourse, structures the philosophical text.
The reader of the philosophical text will
recognize[]{#calibre_link-1257} this self-movement in his consciousness
as he surrenders himself to and masters the text. Any prefatory gesture,
abstracting so-called themes, robs philosophy of its self-moving
structure. "In modern times," Hegel writes, "an individual finds the
abstract form ready
made."^[]{#calibre_link-471}[5](#calibre_link-59){.nounder}^ Further,

let \[modern man\] read reviews of philosophical works, and even go to
the length of reading the prefaces and first[]{#calibre_link-1258}
paragraphs of the works themselves; for the latter give the general
principles on which everything turns, while the reviews along with the
historical notice provide over and above the critical judgment and
appreciation, which, being a judgment passed on the work, goes farther
than the work that is judged. This common way a man can take in his
dressing-gown. But spiritual elation in the
eternal,[]{#calibre_link-1259} the sacred, the infinite, moves along the
high way of truth in the robes of the high
priest.^[]{#calibre_link-472}[6](#calibre_link-60){.nounder}^

Yet, as Hyppolite points out, Hegel damns the preface in general even as
he writes his own "Preface." And Derrida suggests that a very
significant part of Hegel's work was but a play of prefaces (*Dis* 15f).
Whereas Hegel's []{#calibre_link-1094}impatience with prefaces is based
on philosophical grounds, his excuse for
continuing[]{#calibre_link-1260} to write them seems commonsensical:
"Having in mind that the general idea of what is to be done, if it
precedes the attempt to carry it out, facilitates the comprehension of
this process, it is worth while to indicate here some rough idea of it,
with the intention of eliminating at the same time certain forms whose
habitual presence is a hindrance to philosophical knowledge \[*in der
Absicht zugleich,[]{#calibre_link-1261} bei dieser Gelegenheit einige
Formen zu entfernen, deren Gewohnheit ein Hindernis für das
philosophische Erkennen
ist*\]."^[]{#calibre_link-473}[7](#calibre_link-61){.nounder}^ Hegel's
objection to prefaces reflects the following structure: preface/text =
abstract generality/self-moving activity. His acceptance of prefaces
reflects another structure: preface/text = signifier/signified. And the
name of the "=" in this formula is the Hegelian
*Aufhebung*[]{#calibre_link-1262}.

*Aufhebung* is a relationship between two terms where the second at once
annuls the first and lifts it up into a higher sphere of existence; it
is a hierarchial concept generally translated "sublation" and now
sometimes translated "sublimation." A successful preface is *aufgehoben*
into the text it precedes, just as a word is *aufgehoben* into its
meaning. It is as if, to use one of Derrida's
structural[]{#calibre_link-1263} metaphors, the son or seed (preface or
word), caused or engendered by the father (text or meaning) is recovered
by the father and thus justified.

But, within this structural metaphor, Derrida's cry is "dissemination,"
the seed that neither inseminates nor is recovered by the father, but is
scattered abroad.^[]{#calibre_link-474}[8](#calibre_link-62){.nounder}^
And he makes room for the prefatory gesture in quite another way:

The preface is a necessary[]{#calibre_link-1264} gesture of homage and
parricide, for the book (the father) makes a claim of authority or
origin which is both true and false. (As regards parricide, I speak
theoretically. The preface need make no overt claim---as this one does
not---of destroying its pre-text. As a preface, it is already
surrendered to that gesture. ...) Humankind's common desire is for a
stable center, and for the assurance of[]{#calibre_link-1265}
mastery---through knowing or possessing. And a book, with its ponderable
shape and its beginning, middle, and end, stands to satisfy that desire.
But what sovereign subject is the origin of the book? "I was not one man
only," says Proust's narrator, "but the steady advance hour after hour
of an army in close formation, in which there appeared, according to the
moment, impassioned men, indifferent[]{#calibre_link-1266} men, jealous
men. ... In a composite mass, these elements may, one by one, *without
our noticing it*, be replaced by others, which others again eliminate or
reinforce, until in the end a change has been brought about which it
would be impossible to conceive if we were a single
person."^[]{#calibre_link-475}[9](#calibre_link-63){.nounder}^ What,
then, is the book's identity? Ferdinand de Saussure had remarked that
the "same" phoneme pronounced twice[]{#calibre_link-1267} or by two
different people is []{#calibre_link-1268}not identical with itself. Its
only identity is in its difference from all other phonemes (77--78,
52--54[]{#calibre_link-1103}[\*](#calibre_link-64){.nounder}). So do the
two readings of the "same" book show an identity that can only be
defined as a difference. The book is not repeatable in its "identity":
each reading of the book produces a simulacrum of an "original" that is
itself the mark of the shifting and unstable[]{#calibre_link-1269}
subject that Proust describes, using and being used by a language that
is also shifting and unstable. Any preface commemorates that difference
in identity by inserting itself between two readings---in our case, my
reading (given of course that my language and I are shifting and
unstable), my rereading, my rearranging of the text---and your reading.
As Hegel (and other defenders of the authority of[]{#calibre_link-1270}
the text) wrote preface on preface to match re-editions and revised
versions, they unwittingly became a party to this identity in
difference:

From the moment that the circle turns, that the book is wound back upon
itself, that the book repeats itself, its self-identity receives an
imperceptible difference which allows us to step effectively,
rigorously, and thus discreetly, out of the
closure.[]{#calibre_link-1271} Redoubling the closure, one splits it.
Then one escapes it furtively, between two passages through the same
book, through the same line, following the same bend. ... This departure
outside of the identical within the same remains very slight, it weighs
nothing, it thinks and weighs the book *as such*. The return to the book
is also the abandoning of the book. (*ED* 430)

The preface, by daring to repeat[]{#calibre_link-1272} the book and
reconstitute it in another register, merely enacts what is already the
case: the book's repetitions are always other than the book. There is,
in fact, no "book" other than these ever-different repetitions: the
"book" in other words, is always already a "text," constituted by the
play of identity and difference. A written preface provisionally
localizes the place where, between reading[]{#calibre_link-1273} and
reading, book and book, the inter-inscribing of "reader(s),"
"writer(s)," and language is forever at work. Hegel had closed the
circle between father and son, text and preface. He had in fact
suggested, as Derrida makes clear, that the fulfilled concept---the end
of the self-acting method of the philosophical text---was the
pre-dicate---pre-saying---pre-face, to the preface. In Derrida's
reworking,[]{#calibre_link-1274} the structure preface-text becomes open
at both ends. The text has no stable identity, no stable origin, no
stable end. Each act of reading the "text" is a preface to the next. The
reading of a self-professed preface is no exception to this rule.

It is inaccurate yet necessary to say that something called *De la
grammatologie* is (was) the provisional origin of my preface. And, even
as I write,[]{#calibre_link-1275} I project the moment, when you,
reading, will find in my preface the provisional origin of your reading
of *Of Grammatology*. There can be an indefinite number of variations on
that theme.

[]{#calibre_link-979}Why must we worry over so simple a thing as
preface-making? There is, of course, no real answer to questions of this
sort. The most that can be said, and Derrida has reminded us to say it
anew, is that a certain[]{#calibre_link-1276} view of the world, of
consciousness, and of language has been accepted as the correct one,
and, if the minute particulars of that view are examined, a rather
different picture (that is also a no-picture, as we shall see) emerges.
That examination involves an enquiry into the "operation" of our most
familiar gestures. To quote Hegel again:

What is "familiarly known" is not properly known,
just[]{#calibre_link-1277} for the reason that it is "familiar." When
engaged in the process of knowing, it is the commonest form of
self-deception, and a deception of other people as well, to assume
something to be familiar, and to let it pass *\[gefallen zu lassen\]* on
that very account. Knowledge of that sort, with all its talking around
it *\[Hin- und Herreden\]* never gets from the spot, but has no idea
that this is the case.[]{#calibre_link-1278} ... To display
*\[auseinanderlegen\]* an idea in its original *\[ursprünglich\]*
elements means returning upon its moments,
...^[]{#calibre_link-476}[10](#calibre_link-65){.nounder}^

When Derrida writes that, since Kant, philosophy has become aware of
taking the responsibility for its discourse, it is this reexamination of
the familiar that he is hinting at. And this is one of the reasons why
he is so drawn to Mallarmé, "that exemplary poet," who
invested[]{#calibre_link-1279} every gesture of reading and
writing---even the slitting of an uncut double page with a knife---with
textual import.^[]{#calibre_link-477}[11](#calibre_link-66){.nounder}^

And if the assumption of responsibility for one's discourse leads to the
conclusion that all conclusions are genuinely provisional and therefore
inconclusive, that all origins are similarly unoriginal, that
responsibility itself must cohabit with frivolity, this need not be
cause[]{#calibre_link-1280} for gloom. Derrida contrasts Rousseau's
melancholy with Nietzsche's affirmative joy precisely from this angle:
"Turned toward the presence, lost or impossible, of the absent origin,
\[the\] structuralist thematic of broken immediateness is thus the sad,
*negative*, nostalgic, guilty, Rousseauist aspect of the thought of play
of which the Nietzschean *affirmation*---the joyous affirmation of the
play of[]{#calibre_link-1281} the world and of the innocence of
becoming, the affirmation of a world of signs without fault, without
truth, without origin, offered to an active interpretation---would be
the other side." (*ED* 427, *SC* 264)

There is, then, always already a preface between two hands holding open
a book. And the "prefacer," of the same or another proper name as the
"author," need not apologize for "repeating" the[]{#calibre_link-1282}
text.

### ***I*** {#i .h2}

"It is inaccurate yet necessary to say," I have written above, "that
something called *De la grammatologie* is (was) the provisional origin
of my []{#calibre_link-954}preface." Inaccurate yet necessary. My
predicament is an analogue for a certain philosophical exigency that
drives Derrida to writing "sous rature," which I translate as "under
erasure." This is to write a word, cross it out, and then print
both[]{#calibre_link-1283} word and deletion. (Since the word is
inaccurate, it is crossed out. Since it is necessary, it remains
legible.) To take an example from Derrida that I shall cite again: "...
the sign ![image](images/000004.jpg){.calibre7} that ill-named
![image](images/000008.jpg){.calibre7} ... which escapes the instituting
question of philosophy ..." (31, 19).

In[]{#calibre_link-1284} examining familiar things we come to such
unfamiliar conclusions that our very language is twisted and bent even
as it guides us. Writing "under erasure" is the mark of this contortion.

Derrida directs us to Martin Heidegger's *Zur Seinsfrage* as the
"authority" for this strategically important
practice,^[]{#calibre_link-478}[12](#calibre_link-67){.nounder}^ which
we cannot understand without a look at Heidegger's formulation of it.

*Zur Seinsfrage*[]{#calibre_link-1285} is ostensibly a letter to Ernst
Jünger which seeks to establish a speculative definition of nihilism.
Just as Hegel, writing a preface, philosophically confronted the problem
of prefaces, so Heidegger, establishing a definition, philosophically
confronts the problem of definitions: in order for the nature of
anything in particular to be defined as an entity, the question of Being
in general must[]{#calibre_link-1286} always already be broached and
answered in the affirmative. That something *is*, presupposes that
*anything* can be.

What is this question of Being that is necessarily precomprehended in
order that thinking itself occur? Since it is always anterior to
thinking, it can never be formulated as an answer to the question "what
is ...:" "The 'goodness' of the rightfully demanded 'good definition'
finds its[]{#calibre_link-1287} confirmation in our giving up the wish
to define in so far as this must be established on assertions in which
thinking dies out. ... No information can be given about nothingness and
Being and nihilism, about their essence and about the (verbal) essence
\[it *is\]* of the (nominal) essence *\[it* is\] which can be presented
tangibly in the form of assertions \[it is ...\]." (*QB* 80--81) This
possibility of Being[]{#calibre_link-1288} must be granted (or rather is
already of itself granted) for the human being to say "I am," not to
mention "you are," "she is." Even such negative concepts as
"nothingness" or "nihilism" are held within this precomprehended
question of Being which is asked and answered non-verbally,
nonnominally, and without agency. This question, therefore, cannot be
constructed to match an assertive answer.[]{#calibre_link-1289} And the
human being is the place or zone where this particular problem has its
play; not the human being as an individual, but the human being as
*Dasein*---simply being-there---as the principle that asks and posits:
'Man does not only stand *in* the critical zone. ... He himself, but not
he for himself and particularly not through himself alone, *is* this
zone. ..." (*QB* 82--83) But, Heidegger cautions us,
this[]{#calibre_link-1290} is not mysticism. It is the baffling result
of an examination of the obvious, the lifting of the most natural
forgetfulness.

"What if even the \[propositional\] language of metaphysics and
metaphysics []{#calibre_link-1009}itself, whether it be that of the
living or of the dead God, *as* metaphysics, formed that barrier which
forbids a crossing over *\[Übergehen\]* the line \[from the assertion,
to the question, of Being\]?"[]{#calibre_link-1291} (Elsewhere Heidegger
suggests, as does, of course, Nietzsche before him, that the
propositional language of the sciences is just as forgetful of the
question of Being.) "If that were the case, would not then the crossing
\[out\] \[diagonally---*Überqueren\]* of the line necessarily become a
transformation of language and demand a transformed relationship to the
essence of language?" (*QB* 70--71)

As a move[]{#calibre_link-1292} toward this transformation, Heidegger
crosses out the word "Being," and lets both deletion and word stand. It
is inaccurate to use the word "Being" here, for the differentiation of a
"concept" of Being has already slipped away from that precomprehended
question of Being. Yet it is necessary to use the word, since language
cannot do more:

A thoughtful glance ahead into this realm of "Being"
can[]{#calibre_link-1293} only write it as
![image](images/000001.jpg){.calibre7} The drawing of these crossed
lines at first only wards off *\[abwehrt\]*, especially the habit of
conceiving "Being" as something standing by itself. ... The sign of
crossing through *\[Zeichen der Durchkreuzung\]* can, to be sure, ...
not be a merely negative sign of crossing out *\[Zeichen der
Durchstreichung\]*. ... Man in his[]{#calibre_link-1294} essence is the
memory \[or "memorial," *Gedächtnis\]* of Being, but of
![image](images/000001.jpg){.calibre7} This means that the essence of
man is a part of that which in the crossed intersected lines of
![image](images/000001.jpg){.calibre7} puts thinking under the claim of
a more originary command *\[anfänglichere Geheiss\]. (QB* 80--81,
82--83)

[]{#calibre_link-1295}Language is indeed straining here. The sentence
"Man in his essence is the memory (memorial) of Being" avoids ascribing
an agent to the unaskable question of Being. Heidegger is working with
the resources of the old language, the language we already possess, and
which possesses us. To make a new word is to run the risk of forgetting
the problem or believing it solved: "That the transformation of
the[]{#calibre_link-1296} language which contemplates the essence of
Being is subject to other demands than the exchanging of an old
terminology for a new one, seems to be clear." This transformation
should rather involve "crossing out" the relevant old terms and thus
liberating them, exposing "the presumptuous demand that \[thinking\]
know the solution of the riddles and bring salvation." (*QB* 72--73)

Now there is a certain[]{#calibre_link-1297} difference between what
Heidegger puts under erasure and what Derrida does. "Being" is the
master-word that Heidegger crosses out. Derrida does not reject this.
But his word is "trace" (the French word carries strong implications of
track, footprint, imprint), a word that cannot be a master-word, that
presents itself as the mark of an anterior presence, origin, master. For
"trace" one can substitute[]{#calibre_link-1298} "archewriting"
("archi-écriture"), or "differance," or in fact quite a few other words
that Derrida uses in the same way. But I shall begin with "trace/track,"
[]{#calibre_link-815}for it is a simple word; and there also seems, I
must admit, something ritually satisfying about beginning with the
"trace."

To be sure, when Heidegger sets Being before all concepts, he is
attempting to free language from the fallacy[]{#calibre_link-1299} of a
fixed origin, which is also a fixed end. But, *in a certain way*, he
also sets up Being as what Derrida calls the "transcendental signified."
For whatever a concept might "mean," anything that is conceived of in
its being-present must lead us to the already-answered question of
Being. In that sense, the sense of the final reference, Being is indeed
the final signified to which all signifiers[]{#calibre_link-1300} refer.
But Heidegger makes it clear that Being cannot be contained by, is
always prior to, indeed transcends, signification. It is therefore a
situation where the signified commands, and is yet free of, all
signifiers---a recognizably theological situation. The end of
philosophy, according to Heidegger, is to restore the memory of that
free and commanding signified, to discover *Urwörter*
(originary[]{#calibre_link-1301} words) in the languages of the world by
learning to waylay the limiting logic of signification, a project that
Derrida describes as "the other side of nostalgia, which I will call
Heideggerian *hope*.... I ... shall relate it to what seems to me to be
retained of metaphysics in \[Heidegger's\] 'Spruch des Anaximander,'
namely, the quest for the proper word and the unique name." (MP 29, SP
159--60)

Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1302} seems to show no nostalgia for a lost
presence. He sees in the traditional concept of the sign a
hetercogeneity---"the other of the signified is never contemporary, is
at best a subtly discrepant inverse or parallel-discrepant by the time
of a breath---of the order of the signifier" (31, 18). It is indeed an
ineluctable nostalgia for presence that makes of this heterogeneity a
unity by declaring[]{#calibre_link-1303} that a sign brings forth the
presence of the signified. Otherwise it would seem clear that the sign
is the place where "the completely other is announced as such---without
any simplicity, any identity, any resemblance or continuity---in that
which is not it" (69, 47). Word and thing or thought never in fact
become one. We are reminded of, referred to, what the convention of
words sets up as thing or thought,[]{#calibre_link-1304} by a particular
arrangement of words. The structure of reference works and can go on
working not because of the identity between these two so-called
component parts of the sign, but because of their relationship of
difference. The sign marks a place of difference.

One way of satisfying the rage for unity is to say that, within the
phonic sign (speech rather than writing) there is no
structure[]{#calibre_link-1305} of difference; and that this
nondifference is felt as self-presence in the silent and solitary
thought of the self. This is so familiar an argument that we would
accept it readily if we did not stop to think about it. But if we did,
we would notice that there is no necessary reason why a particular sound
should be identical with a "thought or thing"; and that the argument
applies even when one "speaks"[]{#calibre_link-1306} silently to
oneself. Saussure was accordingly obliged to []{#calibre_link-1307}point
out that the phonic signifier is as conventional as the graphic (74,
51).

Armed with this simple yet powerful insight---powerful enough to
"deconstruct the transcendental signified"---that the sign, phonic as
well as graphic, is a structure of difference, Derrida suggests that
what opens the possibility of thought is not merely the
question[]{#calibre_link-1308} of being, but also the never-annulled
difference from "the completely other." Such is the strange "being" of
the sign: half of it always "not there" and the other half always "not
that." The structure of the sign is determined by the trace or track of
that other which is forever absent. This other is of course never to be
found in its full being. As even such empirical events as answering
a[]{#calibre_link-1309} child's question or consulting the dictionary
proclaim, one sign leads to another and so on indefinitely. Derrida
quotes Lambert and Peirce: "'\[philosophy should\] reduce the *theory of
things* to the *theory of signs*.' ... 'The idea of *manifestation* is
the idea of a sign' " (72, 49), and contrasts them to Husserl and
Heidegger. On the way to the trace/track, the word "sign" has to be put
under erasure:[]{#calibre_link-1310} "the sign
![image](images/000004.jpg){.calibre7} that ill-named
![image](images/000008.jpg){.calibre7} the only one, that escapes the
instituting question of philosophy: 'What is ... ?' "

Derrida, then, gives the name "trace" to the part played by the
radically other within the structure of difference that is the sign. (I
stick to "trace" in my[]{#calibre_link-1311} translation, because it
"looks the same" as Derrida's word; the reader must remind himself of at
least the track, even the spoor, contained within the French word.) In
spite of itself, Saussurean linguistics recognizes the structure of the
sign to be a trace-structure. And Freud's psychoanalysis, to some extent
in spite of itself, recognizes the structure of experience itself to be
a trace-, not a[]{#calibre_link-1312} presence-structure. Following an
argument analogical to the argument on the sign, Derrida puts the word
"experience" under erasure:

As for the concept of experience, it is most unwieldy here. Like all the
notions I am using, it belongs to the history of metaphysics and we can
only use it under erasure. "Experience" has always designated the
relationship with a presence, whether that
relationship[]{#calibre_link-1313} had the form of consciousness or not.
Yet we must, by means of the sort of contortion and contention that
discourse is obliged to undergo, exhaust the resources of the concept of
experience before attaining and in order to attain, by deconstruction,
its ultimate foundation. It is the only way to escape "empiricism" and
the "naive" critiques of experience at the same time (89, 60).

Now we begin[]{#calibre_link-1314} to see how Derrida's notion of "sous
rature" differs from that of Heidegger's. Heidegger's
![image](images/000001.jpg){.calibre7} might point at an inarticulable
presence. Derrida's ![image](images/000009.jpg){.calibre7} is the mark
of the absence of a presence, an always already absent present, of the
lack at the origin that is the[]{#calibre_link-1315} condition of
thought and experience. For somewhat different yet similar
[]{#calibre_link-921}contingencies, both Heidegger and Derrida teach us
to use language in terms of a trace-structure, effacing it even as it
presents its legibility. We must remember this when we wish to attack
Derrida or, for that matter, Heidegger, on certain sorts of
straightforward logical grounds; for, one can always forget the
invisible[]{#calibre_link-1316} erasure, "act as though this makes no
difference." (*MP* 3, *SP*
131)^[]{#calibre_link-479}[13](#calibre_link-68){.nounder}^

Derrida writes thus on the strategy of philosophizing about the trace:

The value of the transcendental arche \[origin\] must make its necessity
felt before letting itself be erased. The concept of the arche-trace
must comply with both that necessity and that erasure. It is in fact
contradictory and not acceptable within the logic[]{#calibre_link-1317}
of identity. The trace is not only the disappearance of origin, ... it
means that the origin did not even disappear, that it was never
constituted except reciprocally by a non-origin, the trace, which thus
becomes the origin of the origin. From then on, to wrench the concept of
the trace from the classical scheme which would derive it from a
presence or from an originary non-trace and which
would[]{#calibre_link-1318} make of it an empirical mark, one must
indeed speak of an originary trace or arche-trace (90, 61).

At once inside and outside a certain Hegelian and Heideggerian
tradition, Derrida, then, is asking us to change certain habits of mind:
the authority of the text is provisional, the origin is a trace;
contradicting logic, we must learn to use and erase our language at the
same time.

In the last[]{#calibre_link-1319} few pages, we have seen Heidegger and
Derrida engaged in the process of this curious practice. Derrida in
particular is acutely aware that it is a question of strategy. It is the
strategy of using the only available language while not subscribing to
its premises, or "operat\[ing\] according to the vocabulary of the very
thing that one delimits." (*MP* 18, *SP* 147) For Hegel, as Hyppolite
remarks, "philosophical[]{#calibre_link-1320} discourse" contains "its
own criticism within itself." (SC 336, 158) And Derrida, describing the
strategy "of a discourse which borrows from a heritage the resources
necessary for the deconstruction of that heritage itself," remarks
similarly, "language bears within itself the necessity of its own
critique." (ED 416, SC 254) The remark becomes clearer in the light of
writing "sous rature":[]{#calibre_link-1321} "At each step I was obliged
to proceed by ellipses, corrections and corrections of corrections,
letting go of each concept at the very moment that I needed to use it,
etc."^[]{#calibre_link-480}[14](#calibre_link-69){.nounder}^

There is some similarity between this strategy and what Lévi-Strauss
calls *bricolage in La pensée
sauvage*.^[]{#calibre_link-481}[15](#calibre_link-70){.nounder}^ Derrida
himself remarks:

Lévi-Strauss will always remain faithful to this double intention: to
preserve as an[]{#calibre_link-1322} instrument that whose truth-value
he criticizes, conserving ... all these old concepts, while at the same
time exposing ... their limits, treating them as tools which can still
be of use. No longer is any truth-value \[or rigorous meaning\]
attributed to them; there is a readiness to abandon them if necessary if
other []{#calibre_link-994}instruments should appear more useful. In the
meantime, their relative efficacy is[]{#calibre_link-1323} exploited,
and they are employed to destroy the old machinery to which they belong
and of which they themselves are pieces. Thus it is that the language of
the human sciences criticizes *itself*. (*ED* 417; *SC* 255, 254)

One distinction between Lévi-Strauss and Derrida is clear enough.
Lévi-Strauss's anthropologist seems free to pick his tool; Derrida's
philosopher knows that there is no tool that[]{#calibre_link-1324} does
not belong to the metaphysical box, and proceeds from there. But there
is yet another difference, a difference that we must mark as we outline
Derridean strategy.

Lévi-Strauss contrasts the *bricoleur* to the engineer. ("The
'bricoleur' has no precise equivalent in English. He is a man who
undertakes odd jobs and is a Jack of all trades or is a kind of
professional do-it-yourself man, but[]{#calibre_link-1325} . . he is of
a different standing from, for instance, the English 'odd job man' or
handyman."^[]{#calibre_link-482}[16](#calibre_link-71){.nounder}^) The
discourse of anthropology and the other sciences of man must be
*bricolage:* the discourses of formal logic, and the pure sciences, one
presumes, can be those of engineering. The engineer's "instrument" is
"specially adapted to a specific technical need"; the *bricoleur* makes
do with things that were[]{#calibre_link-1326} meant perhaps for other
ends.^[]{#calibre_link-483}[17](#calibre_link-72){.nounder}^ The
anthropologist must tinker because, at least as Lévi-Strauss argues in
*Le cru et le cuit*, it is in fact impossible for him to master the
whole field. Derrida, by an important contrast, suggests that the field
is *theoretically*, not merely empirically, unknowable. (*ED* 419 f., SC
259 f.) Not even in an ideal universe of an empirically reduced number
of possibilities[]{#calibre_link-1327} would the projected "end" of
knowledge ever coincide with its "means." Such a
coincidence---"engineering"---is an impossible dream of plenitude. The
reason for *bricolage* is that there can be nothing else. No engineer
can make the "means"---the sign---and the "end"---meaning---become
self-identical. Sign will always lead to sign, one substituting the
other (playfully, since "sign" is "under erasure") as
signifier[]{#calibre_link-1328} and signified in turn. Indeed, the
notion of play is important here. Knowledge is not a systematic tracking
down of a truth that is hidden but may be found. It is rather the field
"of *freeplay*, that is to say, a field of infinite substitutions in the
closure of a finite ensemble." (*ED* 423, *SC* 260)

For Derrida, then, the concept of the "engineer" "questioning the
universe" is, like Hegel's father-text[]{#calibre_link-1329}
encompassing the son-preface, or Heidegger's Being as transcendental
signified, "a theological idea," an idea that we *need* to fulfill our
desire for plenitude and authority. He remarks that Lévi-Strauss, like
Heidegger, is afflicted with nostalgia: "one ... perceives in his work a
sort of ethic of presence, an ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic
of archaic and natural innocence, of a purity[]{#calibre_link-1330} of
presence and self-presence in speech---an ethic, nostalgia, and even
remorse which he often presents as the motivation of the ethnological
project when he moves toward archaic
[]{#calibre_link-1331}societies---exemplary societies in his eyes. These
texts are well known." (*ED* 427, *SC* 264)

Derrida does not offer the obverse of this nostalgia. He does not see in
the method of the so-called exact sciences an
epistemological[]{#calibre_link-1332} model of exactitude. All
knowledge, whether one knows it or not, is a species of *bricolage*,
with its eye on the myth of "engineering." But that myth is always
totally other, leaving an originary trace within "bricolage." Like all
"useful" words, "bricolage" must also be placed "under erasure." For it
can only be defined by its difference from its opposite---"engineering."
Yet that opposite, a metaphysical[]{#calibre_link-1333} norm, can in
fact never be present and thus, strictly speaking, there is no concept
of "bricolage" (that which is not engineering). Yet the concept must be
used---untenable but necessary. "From the moment that we cease to
believe in such an engineer ... as soon as it is admitted that every
finite discourse is bound by a certain *bricolage*, ... the very idea of
*bricolage* is menaced and the difference[]{#calibre_link-1334} in which
it took on its meaning decomposes." (ED 418, SC 256) The possible and
implicit hierarchical move, reminding us that *bricolage* as a model is
"pre-scientific," low on a chain of teleologic development, here
disappears. Derrida does not allow the possibility of seeing *bricolage*
as a cruder, pre-scientific method of investigation, low on the
evolutionary scale. One can now begin to
understand[]{#calibre_link-1335} a rather cryptic sentence in the
*Grammatology:* "Without that track \[of writing under erasure\], ...
the ultratranscendental text *\[bricolage* under erasure\] will so
closely resemble the pre-critical text *\[bricolage* plain and simple\]
as to be indistinguishable from it." (90, 61)

This undoing yet preserving of the opposition between *bricolage* and
engineering is an analogue for Derrida's attitude
toward[]{#calibre_link-1336} all oppositions---an attitude that "erases"
(in this special sense) all oppositions. I shall come back to this
gesture again and again in this Preface.

(As he develops the notion of the joyful yet laborious strategy of
rewriting the old language---a language, incidentally, we must know
well---Derrida mentions the "clôture" of metaphysics. We must know that
we are within the "clôture" of metaphysics,[]{#calibre_link-1337} even
as we attempt to undo it. It would be an historicist mistake to
represent this "closure" of metaphysics as simply the temporal
finishing-point of metaphysics. It is also the metaphysical desire to
make the end coincide with the means, create an *en*closure, make the
definition coincide with the defined, the "father" with the "son";
within the logic of identity to balance the equation,
close[]{#calibre_link-1338} the circle. Our language reflects this
desire. And so it is from within this language that we must attempt an
"opening.")

### []{#calibre_link-899 .calibre3}***II*** {#ii .h2}

Derrida uses the word "metaphysics" very simply as shorthand for any
science of presence. (If he were to attempt a rigorous definition of
metaphysics, the word would no doubt go "under erasure.") But it is this
simple *bricoleur's* take on the word that permits Derrida
to[]{#calibre_link-1339} allow the possibility of a "Marxist" or
"structuralist" metaphysics. He puts it succinctly in that early essay
from which I have already quoted:

The history of metaphysics, like the history of the West, is the history
of these metaphors and
metonymies.^[]{#calibre_link-484}[18](#calibre_link-73){.nounder}^ Its
matrix---if you will pardon me for demonstrating so little and for being
so elliptical in order to bring me more quickly to my principal
theme---is[]{#calibre_link-1340} the determination of being as
*presence* in all the senses of this word. It would be possible to show
that all the names related to fundamentals, to principles, or to the
center have always designated the constant of a presence---*eidos,
archè, telos, energeia, ousia* (essence, existence, substance, subject)
*aletheia*, transcendentality, consciousness, or conscience, God, man,
and so forth. (*ED* 410--11,[]{#calibre_link-1341} *SC* 249)

I have lingered on the "question of the preface" and the pervasive
Derridean practice of the "sous rature" to slip into the atmosphere of
Derrida's thought. Now I speak of his acknowledged
"precursors"---Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger,
Husserl.^[]{#calibre_link-485}[19](#calibre_link-74){.nounder}^ I shall
attend in greatest detail to Nietzsche because our received version of
him is so different from Derrida's, and because Derrida's
relationship[]{#calibre_link-1342} to him is so inescapable. I shall
then comment on Derrida's attitudes toward structuralism; on his own
vocabulary and practice and on the structure of the *Grammatology*. A
few words next about translation, and we are into the text.

Derrida has given us two lists of what we should look for in Nietzsche:
"the systematic mistrust of metaphysics as a whole, the formal approach
to philosophic discourse,[]{#calibre_link-1343} the concept of the
philosopher-artist, the rhetorical and philological question asked of
the history of philosophy, the suspicion of the values of truth ('well
applied convention'), of meaning and of being, of 'meaning of being',
the attention to the economic phenomena of force and of difference of
forces, and so forth." (MP 362--63) And, "Radicalizing the concepts of
*interpretation, perspective,[]{#calibre_link-1344} evaluation,
difference*... Nietzsche, far from remaining *simply* (with Hegel and as
Heidegger wished) *within* metaphysics, contributed a great deal to the
liberation of the signifier from its dependence or derivation with
respect to the logos, and the related concept of truth or the primary
signified ..." (31--32, 19).

[]{#calibre_link-1017}It should by now be clear that Nietzsche's
"suspicion of the value of truth ... of meaning[]{#calibre_link-1345}
and of being, of 'meaning of being' " of the "concept of ... the primary
signified," is intimately shared by Derrida. The other items on the two
lists can be brought under one head: philosophical discourse as formal,
rhetorical, figurative discourse, a something to be deciphered. The end
of this Preface will make clear how deeply Derrida is committed to such
a notion. Here I shall comment on[]{#calibre_link-1346} the implications
of "the decipherment of figurative discourse" in Nietzsche.

As early as 1873, Nietzsche described metaphor as the originary process
of what the intellect presents as "truth." "The intellect, as a means
for the preservation of the individual, develops its chief power in
dissimulation."^[]{#calibre_link-486}[20](#calibre_link-75){.nounder}^
"A nerve-stimulus, first transcribed *\[übertragen\]* into an image
*\[Bild\]*! First metaphor! The[]{#calibre_link-1347} image again copied
into a sound! Second metaphor! And each time he \[the creator of
language\] leaps completely out of one sphere right into the midst of an
entirely different one." (NW III. ii. 373, TF 178) In its simplest
outline, Nietzsche's definition of metaphor seems to be the establishing
of an identity between dissimilar things. Nietzsche's phrase is "Gleich
machen" (make equal), calling to[]{#calibre_link-1348} mind the German
word "Gleichnis"---image, simile, similitude, comparison, allegory,
parable---an unmistakable pointer to figurative practice in general.
"Every idea originates through equating the unequal." (NW III. ii. 374,
TF 179) "What, therefore, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors,
metonymies, anthropomorphisms; ... truths are illusions of which one has
forgotten that they *are* illusions, ... coins[]{#calibre_link-1349}
which have their obverse effaced and now are no longer of account as
coins but merely as metal." (*NW III*. ii. 374--75, TF 180) I hold on
here to the notions of a process of figuration and a process of
forgetfulness.

In this early text, Nietzsche describes the figurative drive as "that
impulse towards the formation of metaphors, that fundamental impulse of
man, which we cannot reason away for one[]{#calibre_link-1350}
moment---for thereby we should reason away man himself. ... (NW III. ii.
381, *TF* 188) Later he will give this drive the name "will to power."
Our so-called will to truth is a will to power because "the so-called
drive for knowledge can be traced back to a drive to appropriate and
conquer."^[]{#calibre_link-487}[21](#calibre_link-76){.nounder}^
Nietzsche's sense of the inevitable forcing of the issue, of exercising
power, comes through in his italics:[]{#calibre_link-1351} "'Thinking'
in primitive conditions (preorganic) is the crystallization of forms.
... In our thought, the essential feature is fitting new material into
old schemas,... *making* equal what is
new."^[]{#calibre_link-488}[22](#calibre_link-77){.nounder}^

The human being has nothing more to go on than a collection of nerve
stimuli. And, because he or she must be secure in the knowledge of, and
therefore power over, the "world" (inside or outside), the
nerve[]{#calibre_link-1352} stimuli are explained and described through
the categories of figuration that masquerade as the categories of
"truth." These explanations and []{#calibre_link-1013}descriptions are
"interpretations" and reflect a human inability to tolerate undescribed
chaos---"that the collective character *\[Gesamtcharakter\]* of the
world ... is in all eternity chaos---in the sense not of a lack of
necessity but of a lack of order, arrangement,[]{#calibre_link-1353}
form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever other names there are for our
aesthetic anthropomorphisms \[human
weaknesses---*Menschlichkeiten\]."^[]{#calibre_link-489}[23](#calibre_link-78){.nounder}^*
As Nietzsche suggests, this need for power through anthropomorphic
defining compels humanity to create an unending proliferation of
interpretations whose only "origin," that shudder in the nerve strings,
being a direct sign of nothing, leads to no primary
signified.[]{#calibre_link-1354} As Derrida writes, Nietzsche provides
an "entire thematics of active interpretations, which substitutes an
incessant deciphering for the disclosure of truth as a presentation of
the thing itself." (*MP* 19, *SP* 149)

Interpretation is "the introduction of meaning" (or "deception through
meaning"---*Sinnhineinlegen*), a making-sign that is a making-figure,
for there is, in this thought, no possibility[]{#calibre_link-1355} of a
literal, true, self-identical meaning. Identification (*Gleich-machen*)
constitutes the act of figuration. Therefore, "nothing is ever
comprehended, but rather designated and distorted. ..." This extends, of
course, to the identity between an act (effect) and its purpose (cause):
"Every single time something is done with a purpose in view, something
fundamentally different and other occurs."[]{#calibre_link-1356} (WM II.
59, 130; WP 301, 351) The will to power is a process of "incessant
deciphering"---figurating, interpreting, sign-ifying through apparent
identification. Thus, even supposing that an act could be isolated
within its outlines, to gauge the relationship between it and its
"originating" consciousness, the critical glance must reverse
(necessarily nonidentically) this decipherment, follow the
*[]{#calibre_link-1357}"askew* path," read the act in its textuality. In
this important respect, "without him \[Nietzsche\] the 'question' of the
text would never have erupted, at least in the precise sense that it has
taken today."^[]{#calibre_link-490}[24](#calibre_link-79){.nounder}^

In *The Genealogy of Morals*, Nietzsche reads the history of morality as
a text. He interprets the successive *meanings* of systems of morality.
"Purposes and utilities are only signs that a[]{#calibre_link-1358} will
to power has become master of something less powerful and has in turn
imprinted the meaning of a function upon it *\[ihm von sich aus den Sinn
einer Funktion aufgeprägt hat;* this image of
*Aufprägung*---imprinting---'figuration' in yet another sense, is most
important in Nietzsche, and constantly recurs in this particular
context\]; and the entire history of a 'thing', an organ, a custom can
in this[]{#calibre_link-1359} way be a continuous sign-chain of ever new
interpretations and makeshift excuses *\[Zurechtmachungen\]* whose
causes do not even have to be related to one another in a purely chance
fashion."^[]{#calibre_link-491}[25](#calibre_link-80){.nounder}^ "All
concepts in which an entire process is semiotically telescoped
*\[Zusammenfasst\]* elude definition." (*NW*, VI. ii. 333, GM 80)
Derrida would, of course, suspend the entire notion of semiosis, put the
sign[]{#calibre_link-1360} under erasure. It is possible to read
[]{#calibre_link-1019}such a suspension into Nietzsche's "continuous
sign-chains," without origin and end in "truth." And thus it is possible
to discover an affinity between Derrida's practice in *Of Grammatology*
and Nietzsche's interpretation of value systems as infinite textuality;
and to see in Derrida's decipherment of the negative valuation of
writing within the speech-writing[]{#calibre_link-1361} hierarchy the
mark of a Nietzschean "genealogy."

But it is also possible to criticize Nietzsche's indefinite expansion of
the notion of metaphoricity or figuration as a gesture that turns back
upon itself. "Nietzsche stretches the limits of the metaphorical,"
Derrida writes:

to such a point that he attributes metaphorical power to every use of
sound in speaking: for does this not involve the[]{#calibre_link-1362}
transfer into the time of speaking of something that has a different
nature in itself? ... Strangely enough, this comes down to treating
every signifier as a metaphor for the signified, while the classical
concept of metaphor denotes only the substitution of one signified for
another so that the one becomes the signifier of the other. Is not
Nietzsche's procedure here precisely to extend to every
element[]{#calibre_link-1363} of discourse, under the name *metaphor*,
what classical rhetoric no less strangely considered a quite specific
figure of speech, *metonymy of the sign* \[that the sign as "a part"
*stood for* "the whole"
meaning\]?"^[]{#calibre_link-492}[26](#calibre_link-81){.nounder}^

We should, of course, note that Derrida's criticism is framed in two
questions, rather than in a series of declarations. Yet, even if we were
to take only the declarative sentence in our[]{#calibre_link-1364}
passage, it would be clear that Derrida criticizes Nietzsche precisely
because what Nietzsche deciphers he holds decipherable and because
metaphor (or figure) so vastly expanded could simply become the name of
the process of signification rather than a critique of that process. It
would be more acceptable if Nietzsche had put metaphor, or figure, or
interpretation, or perspective, or, for that
matter,[]{#calibre_link-1365} truth, under erasure. I shall suggest that
a move toward such an erasure may be traced through Nietzsche's critique
of consciousness and the "subject." When the outlines of the "subject"
are loosened, the concepts of figuration or metaphoricity---related to
meaning-ful-ness,---are subsumed under the broader categories of
appropriation and the play of resistant forces. The word "metaphor" is
seen[]{#calibre_link-1366} to be used "sous rature," as a methodological
convenience, for it refers to a more encompassing structure not
necessarily involved in meaning-making. Let us follow the unfolding of
this pattern.

The "subject" is a unified concept and therefore the result of
"interpretation." Nietzsche often stresses that it is a specifically
linguistic figurative habit of immemorial standing: "that when it
is[]{#calibre_link-1367} thought *\[wenn gedacht wird\]* there must be
something 'that thinks' is simply a formulation of our grammatical
custom that adds a doer to every deed." (WM II. 13, WP 268) The
*"insertion of a subject"* is *"fictitious."* (WM II. 110, WP 337) The
will to power as the *subject's* metaphorizing or figurating, or
introduction []{#calibre_link-900}of meaning, must therefore be
questioned. And Nietzsche accordingly asks,
pondering[]{#calibre_link-1368} on the "making equal" of proximate
sensations, a propos of how *"images ...* then *words, ...* finally
*concepts* arise in the spirit": "Thus confusion of two sensations that
are close neighbors, as we take note of these sensations; but *who* is
taking note?" (WM II. 23, WP 275) Nietzsche accordingly entertains the
notion of the will to power as an abstract and unlocalized figurative
(interpretative) process:[]{#calibre_link-1369} "One may not ask: 'who
then interprets?' for the interpretation itself is a form of the will to
power, exists (but not as a 'being' but as a process, a becoming) as an
affect." (WM II. 61, WP 302)

Sometimes Nietzsche places this abstract will to power, an incessant
figuration, not under the control of any knowing subject, but rather
underground, in the unconscious. The Nietzschean
unconscious[]{#calibre_link-1370} is that vast arena of the mind of
which the so-called "subject" knows nothing. As Derrida remarks: "both
\[Freud and Nietzsche\] ... often in a very similar way, questioned the
self-assured certitude of consciousness. ... For Nietzsche 'the
important main activity is unconscious.' " (*MP* 18, SP 148)

If, however, we want to hold onto "the important main activity" we have
to go further than the unconscious,[]{#calibre_link-1371} we have to
reach the body, the organism. If the "unconscious" is unknown to us, how
much more so the body! Already in the early essay "On Truth and Falsity
in their Ultramoral Sense," the connections are being established:

What indeed *does* man know about himself? ... Does not nature keep
secret from him most things, even about his body, *e.g*., the
convolutions of the intestines, the quick flow of[]{#calibre_link-1372}
the blood-currents, the intricate vibration of the fibres, so as to
banish and lock him up in proud, delusive knowledge? Nature threw away
the keys and woe to the fateful curiosity which might be able for a
moment to look out and down through a crevice in the chamber of
consciousness, and discover that man indifferent to his own ignorance,
is resting on the pitiless, the greedy, the
insatiable,[]{#calibre_link-1373} the murderous, and, as it were,
hanging in dreams on the back of a tiger. Whence, in the wide world,
with this state of affairs, arise the impulse of truth? (*NW* III. ii,
371, TF 175--76)

Here is the early signal for a sweeping question like this one in *The
Gay Science:* "The unconscious disguise of physiological needs under the
cloaks of the objective, ideal, purely spiritual goes to
frightening[]{#calibre_link-1374} lengths---and often I have asked
myself whether, taking a large view philosophy has not been merely an
interpretation of the body and a *misunderstanding of the body."* (NW V.
ii. 16, GS 34--35) A yet more sweeping declarative fragment: "Our most
sacred convictions, the unchanging elements in our supreme values, are
judgments of our muscles." (WM I. 370, WP 173) It is as if that
controlling figurative[]{#calibre_link-1375} practice that constitutes
all our cognition is being handed over to the body. And indeed
Nietzsche's speculation goes further. "Making equal" is seen as a
symptom of being animate, rather []{#calibre_link-1014}than the
"privilege" of being human; the will to power "appropriates" in the
organism, before the "name of man" may be broached: "All thought,
judgment, perception, as comparison *\[Gleichnis\]* has as its
precondition[]{#calibre_link-1376} a 'positing of equality'
*\[Gleichsetzen\]*, and earlier still a *'making* equal'
*\[Gleich-machen\]*. The process of making equal is the same as the
incorporation of appropriated material in the amoeba ... \[and\]
corresponds exactly to that external, mechanical process (which is its
symbol) by which protoplasm continually makes what it appropriates equal
to itself and arranges it into its own forms and
ranks[]{#calibre_link-1377} *\[in seine Reihen und Formen einordnet\]."*
(WM II. 21, 25; WP 273--74, 276) Appropriation and its symbol, making
equal, positing as equal---the process operates in the organic universe
for its own preservation and constitution before the human consciousness
appropriates it and declares it the process of the discovery of truth,
the establishment of knowledge. The process differentiates itself into
the[]{#calibre_link-1378} mapping of the moral universe: "Is it virtuous
when a cell transforms itself into a function of a stronger cell? It has
to do so *\[Sie muss es\]*. And is it evil when the stronger cell
assimilates the weaker? ... Joy and desire appear together in the
stronger that wants to transform something into its function, joy and
the wish to be desired appear together in the weaker that wants to
become a function."[]{#calibre_link-1379} (NW V. ii. 154, GS 175--76)
Here the relationship between figuration on the one hand, and
appropriation, the play of forces, on the other, comes clear. Speaking
of the human will to truth, linguistic figuration is the figure
Nietzsche must employ. Moving "back" into the organism in general,
differentiations among goodness, strength, truth begin to blur;
appropriation comes to be a more embracing[]{#calibre_link-1380} term
than interpretation. Admittedly, this neutralizing rigor is not often
*explicit* in Nietzsche. But when it is operative, the irreducible
description of the will to power as a search for what is resistant to
itself emerges. "The will to power can manifest itself only against
resistances; therefore it seeks that which resists it. ..." (WM II 123,
WP 346) Consider also that curious series of
notes,[]{#calibre_link-1381} made between November 1887 and March 1888,
where Nietzsche tries to bypass language to express what we can crudely
call the will to power as the play of will and no-will. It is worth
mediating upon the entire passage. Here I quote selectively to give a
sense of the problem:

There are no durable ultimate units, no atoms, no monads; here, too,
beings are only introduced by us. ... "Value" is
essentially[]{#calibre_link-1382} the standpoint for the increase or
decrease of these dominating centers ("multiplicities" in any case, but
"units" are nowhere present in the nature of becoming). Linguistic means
of expression are useless for expressing "becoming"; it accords with our
inevitable need to preserve ourselves to posit a crude world of
stability, of "things," etc. We may venture to speak of atoms and monads
in[]{#calibre_link-1383} a relative sense; and it is certain that the
smallest world is most durable---There is no will: there are
[]{#calibre_link-940}punctuations of will *\[Willens-Punktationen\]*
that are constantly increasing or losing their power. (WM II. 171--72,
*WP* 380--81)

Nietzsche uses the time-honored figure of the point
(*stigmè)^[]{#calibre_link-493}[27](#calibre_link-82){.nounder}^* only
as the relatively safest image of a unit, and even then not as a sign
for durability or continuity,[]{#calibre_link-1384} but rather as the
participant in a disjunctive periodicity of (positive *or* negative)
energizing, a punctuation perhaps also in the sense of the deployment of
space as constituting what is usually taken to be a temporal or
historical continuity. As we shall see later, the structural complicity
here with Freud's psychic time-machine is striking. For the moment our
argument is that in this strained[]{#calibre_link-1385} and hedged image
of the *Willens-Punktationen* (where it is not even clear if the topic
is the restricted human will or the principle of the will to power---for
who, after all, can "linguistically express" the will to power?),
Nietzche's theory of metaphoricity or figuration explodes into "sous
rature" and neutralizes into a play of resisting forces. This is how I
must interpret Derrida's comment,[]{#calibre_link-1386} made outside of
the context of Nietzsche's theory of metaphor: "... the 'active' (in
movement) discord of the different forces and of the differences between
forces which Nietzsche opposes to the entire system of metaphysical
grammar." (*MP* 19, *SP* 149)

Now if the "subject" is thus put in question, it is clear that the
philosopher creating his system must distrust himself as none other. And
indeed[]{#calibre_link-1387} Nietzsche articulates this problem often.
He couches his boldest insights in the form of questions that we cannot
dismiss as a rhetorical ploy. Writing on "The Uses and Abuses of
History" as early as 1874, he wams us: "And this present treatise, as I
will not attempt to deny, shows the modern note of a weak personality in
the intemperateness of its criticism, the unripeness of its humanity, in
the[]{#calibre_link-1388} too frequent transitions from irony to
cynicism, from arrogance to
scepticism."^[]{#calibre_link-494}[28](#calibre_link-83){.nounder}^ The
spirit of self-diagnosis is strong in every Nietzschean text. "Every
society has the tendency to reduce its opponents to caricatures---at
least in imagination--- ... Among immoralists it is the moralist: Plato,
for example, becomes a caricature in my hands." (WM I. 410--11, WP 202)
Quite in passing, he places a warning[]{#calibre_link-1389} frame around
all his philosophizing: "One seeks a picture of the world in *that*
philosophy in which we feel freest; i.e., in which our most powerful
drive feels free to function. This will also be the case with me!" (WM
I. 410--11, WP 224--25) In a passage in *The Gay Science*, he spells out
his version of the particular problem that leads Heidegger and Derrida
to writing under erasure:

How far the[]{#calibre_link-1390} perspective character of existence
extends or indeed whether existence has any other character than this;
whether existence without interpretation, without "sense," does not
become "nonsense"; whether, on the other []{#calibre_link-1391}hand, all
existence is not essentially an *interpreting* existence *\[ein*
auslegendes *Dasein\]*---that cannot be decided even by the most
industrious and most scrupulously conscientious
analysis[]{#calibre_link-1392} and self-examination of the intellect;
for in the course of this analysis the human intellect cannot avoid
seeing itself in its own perspective forms *\[perspektivische* Form\],
and *only* in these. We cannot look around our own corner. (NW V. ii.
308, *GS* 336)

Instances can be multiplied. But we must not only record Nietzsche's
awareness of this problem, but of some of his ways of coping with it.
One[]{#calibre_link-1393} of them might be Nietzsche's pervasive
strategy of intersubstituting opposites. If one is always bound by one's
perspective, one can at least deliberately reverse perspectives as often
as possible, in the process undoing opposed perspectives, showing that
the two terms of an opposition are merely accomplices of each other. It
would take a detailed analysis of Nietzschean practice to
demonstrate[]{#calibre_link-1394} what I am merely going to suggest
here: the notion that the setting up of unitary opposites is an
instrument and a consequence of "making equal," and the dissolving of
opposites is the philosopher's gesture against that will to power which
would mystify her very self. Here let a representative remark suffice:
"There are no opposites: only from those of logic do we derive the
concept of opposites---and[]{#calibre_link-1395} falsely transfer it to
things." (WM II. 56, WP 298)

I have already dwelt on Nietzsche's problematizing of the opposition
between "metaphor" and "concept," "body" and "mind." Any sampling of
Nietzsche's writing would be crosshatched with such undoings. Here are a
few provocative examples, which I append so that the reader may sense
their implicit or explicit workings as she reads the *Grammatology:*

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1396}
:::

Subject and Object; both a matter of interpretation: "No, \[objective\]
facts are precisely what there is not, only interpretations. We cannot
establish any fact 'in itself' ... 'Everything is subjective,' you say;
but even this is interpretation. The subject is not something given, it
is a superadded invention, stuck on to the tail *\[etwas
Hinzu-Erdichtetes, Dahinter-Gestecktes\]."* (WM II. 11--12,
WP[]{#calibre_link-1397} 267)

Truth and error; no "truth" at the origin, but "truths" and
"errors"---neither description more accurate than the other---cast up by
the waves of control-preserving interpretations: "What are man's truths
after all? They are man's *irrefutable* errors." (NW V. ii 196, GS 219)
"Truth is the kind of error without which a certain species of living
being could not live." (WM II. 19, WP 272)

Good[]{#calibre_link-1398} and evil (morality and immorality): "An
absurd presupposition ... takes good and evil for realities that
contradict one another (not as complementary -value concepts). ..." (WM
I. 397, WP 192) "Morality itself is a special case of immorality." (WM
I. 431, WP 217)

Theory and practice: "Dangerous distinction between 'theoretical' and
'practical' ... as if pure spirituality produced *\[vorlege\] ...* the
problems[]{#calibre_link-1399} of []{#calibre_link-901}knowledge and
metaphysics;--- ... as if practice must be judged by its own measure,
whatever the answer of theory might turn out to be *\[ausfalle\]."* (WM
I. 481, WP 251)

Purpose and accident, death and life: "Once you know that there are no
purposes, you also know that there is no accident, for it is only beside
a world of purposes that the word 'accident' has meaning. Let us beware
of saying that[]{#calibre_link-1400} death is opposed to life. The
living is merely a type of what is dead, and a very rare type." (NW V.
ii. 146, GS 168; again, the complicity with Freud's speculations about
the individual, organic life, and inertia is
striking.)^[]{#calibre_link-495}[29](#calibre_link-84){.nounder}^

Nietzsche's undoing of opposites is a version of Derrida's practice of
undoing them through the concept of "differance" (deferment-difference),
which I discuss later.[]{#calibre_link-1401} Derrida himself notes the
affinity:

We could thus take up all the coupled oppositions on which philosophy is
constructed, and from which our language lives, not in order to see
opposition vanish but to see the emergence of a necessity such that one
of the terms appears as the differance of the other, the other as
"differed" within the systematic ordering *\[l'économie\]* of the same
(e.g., the intelligible[]{#calibre_link-1402} as differing from the
sensible, as sensible differed; the concept as differed-differing
intuition, life as differed-differing matter; mind as differed-differing
life; culture as differed-differing nature. ...). In Nietzsche, these
are so many themes that can be related with the symptomatology that
always diagnoses the evasions and ruses of anything disguised in its
differance. (*MP* 18--19, *SP* 148--49)

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1403}
:::

One attempt at a holding action against the impossibility of breaking
out of the enclosure of "interpretation" is a "plural style." In an
essay translated as "The Ends of Man," Derrida writes: "As Nietzsche
said, it is perhaps a change of style that we need; Nietzsche has
reminded us that, if there is style, it must be
*plural*."^[]{#calibre_link-496}[30](#calibre_link-85){.nounder}^ And,
much later, "the question of style can and must try its
strength[]{#calibre_link-1404} against the grand question of the
interpretation, of, simply, interpretation, to resolve or disqualify it
in its statement." (*QS* 253) The confounding of opposites, with the
attendant switching of perspective, might be an example of that plural
style. And so might Nietzsche's use of many registers of discourse in
such works as *Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Gay Science*, and *Ecce
Homo*, or Derrida's[]{#calibre_link-1405} shifts between commentary,
interpretation, "fiction," in the works immediately following *Of
Grammatology* and his typographical play with modes of discourse in
*Marges* or *Glas*.

Perhaps Nietzsche's boldest insight in the face of the inescapable
boundary is an exhortation to the will to ignorance: "It is not enough
that you understand in what ignorance man and beast live; you must also
have and acquire[]{#calibre_link-1406} the *will* to ignorance." (WM II.
98, WP 328) What is more conventionally called "joyful unwisdom" (*NW*
III. i. 252, UA 15) in an []{#calibre_link-1012}early text is later
named "joyful *wisdom"*---the gay science---and seen as the greatest
threat to the chain of self-preservative interpretations that accepts
its own activity as "true" and "good": "The greatest danger that always
hovered over humanity and still hovers over[]{#calibre_link-1407} it is
the eruption of *madness*---which means the eruption of arbitrariness in
feeling, seeing, and hearing, the enjoyment of the mind's lack of
discipline, the joy in human unreason. Not truth and certainty are the
opposite of the world of the madman, but the universality and the
universal binding force of a faith; in sum, the nonarbitrary character
of judgments." (*NW* V. ii. 107--08, *GS* 130) The
will[]{#calibre_link-1408} to ignorance, the joyful wisdom, must also be
prepared to rejoice in uncertainty, to rejoice in and even to-will the
reversal of all values that might have come to seem tenable: "No longer
joy in certainty but in uncertainty ... no longer will to preservation
but to power. ..." (*WM II*. 395, *WP* 545)

This continual risk-taking is the affirmative play in Nietzsche that
Derrida will often comment on.[]{#calibre_link-1409} "I do not know any
other way," Nietzsche writes, "of associating with great tasks than
*play."^[]{#calibre_link-497}[31](#calibre_link-86){.nounder}^* "Wisdom:
that seems to the rabble to be a kind of flight, an artifice and means
for getting oneself out of a dangerous game; but the genuine
philosopher---as he seems to *us*, my friends?---lives
'unphilosophically' and 'unwisely,' above all *imprudently*,... he risks
*himself* constantly, he plays the dangerous[]{#calibre_link-1410}
game."^[]{#calibre_link-498}[32](#calibre_link-87){.nounder}^ This
imprudence, constantly attempting to bypass the prudence of stabilizing
through "interpretation," is *amor fati*, the love of what Derrida calls
"the game of chance with necessity, of contingency with law." (*Dis*
309) This is the dance of the Over-man, a dance Nietzsche describes in
terms of himself with a certain poignancy: "How wonderful and new and
yet how gruesome and ironic I find[]{#calibre_link-1411} my position
vis-à-vis the whole of existence in the light of my insight! ... I
suddenly woke up in the midst of this dream, but only to the
consciousness that I am dreaming and that I *must* go on dreaming lest I
perish---. ... Among all these dreamers, I, too, who 'know,' am dancing
my dance." (*NW* V. ii. 90--91, *GS* 116)

The "knowledge" of the philosopher places him among the dreamers, for
knowledge is[]{#calibre_link-1412} a dream. But the philosopher
"knowingly" agrees to dream, to dream of knowledge, agrees to "forget"
the lesson of philosophy, only so as to "prove" that lesson. ... It is a
vertiginous movement that can go on indefinitely or, to use Nietzschean
language, return eternally. This precarious *"forgetfulness,"* "active
*forgetfulness,"* is what Derrida emphasizes in Nietzsche's Over-man. He
writes, again[]{#calibre_link-1413} in "The Ends of Man":

His \[the Over-man's\] laughter will then break out towards a return
which will no longer have the form of the metaphysical return of
humanism any more than it will undoubtedly take the form, "beyond"
metaphysics, of the memorial or of the guard of the sense of the being,
or the form of the house and the truth []{#calibre_link-1016}of Being.
He will dance, outside of the house, that "aktive
Vergeszlichkeit,"[]{#calibre_link-1414} that active forgetfulness
("oubliance") and that cruel (grausam) feast \[which\] is spoken of in
*The Genealogy of Morals*. No doubt Nietzsche called upon an active
forgetfulness ("oubliance") of Being which would not have had the
metaphysical form which Heidegger ascribed to it. (MP 163, EM 57)

Like everything else in Nietzsche, this forgetfulness is at least
doubleedged. Even in his early writings[]{#calibre_link-1415}
"forgetfulness" makes its appearance in two opposed forms: as a
limitation that protects the human being from the blinding light of an
absolute historical memory (that will, among other things, reveal that
"truths" spring from "interpretations"), as well as an attribute boldly
chosen by the philosopher in order to avoid falling into the trap of
"historical knowledge." In the work of the
seventies,[]{#calibre_link-1416} there are, on the one hand, passages
such as the following (in which we must grasp the full irony of the word
"truth"):

We do not yet know whence the impulse to truth comes, for up to now we
have heard only about the obligation which society imposes in order to
exist: to be truthful, that is, to use the usual metaphors, therefore
expressed morally: we have heard only about the obligation to
lie[]{#calibre_link-1417} according to a fixed convention, to lie
gregariously in a style binding for all. Now man of course forgets that
matters are going thus with him; he therefore lies in that fashion
pointed out unconsciously and according to habits of centuries'
standing---and by *this very unconsciousness*, by this very forgetting,
he arrives at a sense for truth. (*NW* III. ii. 375, *IF* 180--81)

If we appreciate the full[]{#calibre_link-1418} irony of this passage,
it becomes impossible for us to take a passage such as the following,
also written in the seventies, at face value, with the "historical
sense" as the unquestioned villain (although, admittedly, we must make a
distinction between an academic and preservative \[on the one hand\] and
a philosophic and destructive \[on the other\], sense of history): "The
historical sense makes[]{#calibre_link-1419} its servants passive and
retrospective. Only in moments of forgetfulness, when that sense is
intermittent *\[intermittirt;* compare the discontinuous energizing of
*Willens-Punktationen\]*, does the man who is sick of the historical
fever ever act." (*NW* III. i. 301, *UA* 68) And through this network of
shifting values, we begin to glimpse the complexity of the act of
*choosing* forgetfulness, already advanced[]{#calibre_link-1420} as a
partial solution to the problem of history in the same early essay: "...
the antidotes of history are the 'unhistorical' and the
'super-historical.' ... By the word 'unhistorical' I mean the power, the
art of *forgetting*, and of drawing a limited horizon round one's self."
(*NW* III. i. 326, *UA* 95)

I am not going to comment extensively on Nietzsche's thought of
forgetfulness, but simply remark[]{#calibre_link-1421} that, even in the
passage in *The Genealogy* []{#calibre_link-941}*of Morals* to which
Derrida expressly refers, this ambivalence is clearly marked. The joyous
affirmative act of forgetfulness is also a deliberate repression:

Forgetting is no mere *vis inertiae* as the superficial imagine; it is
rather an active and in the strictest sense positive faculty of
repression *\[Hemmungsvermögen\]*, that is responsible for the
fact[]{#calibre_link-1422} that what we experience and absorb enters our
consciousness as little while we are digesting it (one might call the
process "inpsychation") as does the thousandfold process, involved in
physical nourishment---so-called "incorporation." To close the doors and
windows of consciousness for a time; to remain undisturbed by the noise
and struggle of our underworld of utility organs working with and
against[]{#calibre_link-1423} one another; a little quietness, a little
tabula rasa of the consciousness, to make room for new thing, above all
for the nobler functions and functionaries, for regulation, foresight,
premeditation (for our organism is oligarchically directed
*\[oligarchisch eingerichtet\])*---that is the purpose of active
forgetfulness, which is like a doorkeeper, a preserver of psychic order,
repose, and etiquette:[]{#calibre_link-1424} so that it will be
immediately obvious how there could be no happiness, no cheerfulness, no
hope, no pride, no *present*, without forgetfulness. (NW VI. ii.,
307--08; GM 57--58)

"Knowing" that there is nowhere an isolatable unit, not even an
atomistic one, and that conceptions of a unified present are merely an
interpretation, the philosopher, by an act of "forgetting" that
knowledge, wins himself[]{#calibre_link-1425} a "present." Within that
created frame he, who has doubted the possibility of any stable
morality, any possibility of truth, nonetheless speaks in one of the
strongest polemical voices in European thought, not only taking sides
but demolishing his opponents. Nietzsche's work is the unreconciled
playground of this "knowledge" and this "forgetfulness," the
establishment of the knowledge (that presents[]{#calibre_link-1426} all
knowing as mere symptom) as convincing as the voice of forgetfulness
(that gives us the most memorable prophecy). The most common predicament
in the reading of Nietzsche is to defeat oneself in the effort to
establish a coherence between the two. But the sustaining of the
incoherence, to make the two poles in a curious way
interdependent,---that is Nietzsche's superb trick. What
Nietzsche's[]{#calibre_link-1427} *style* brings off here is, to borrow
a Derridean pun, what the *stylus* performs when, in the gesture of
"sous rature," it deletes and leaves legible at the same time. A hint is
lodged in Nietzsche's own description of "the psychological problem in
the type of Zarathustra:" "how he that says No and *does* No to an
unheard-of degree, to everything to which one has so far said Yes, can
nevertheless be[]{#calibre_link-1428} the opposite of a No-saying
spirit."^[]{#calibre_link-499}[33](#calibre_link-88){.nounder}^

Martin Heidegger, as we have seen, dreams of annulling a first
forgetfulness of the question of Being. For him, "all
fundamental-ontological construction *\[fundamental-ontologische
Konstruktion\]* ... must in its plan \[*im Entwerfen\]* wrest from
forgetfulness that which is planned \[*in den Entwurf Genommene\]*. The
basic, fundamental-ontological act of the
metaphysics[]{#calibre_link-1429} []{#calibre_link-953}of *Dasein* is,
therefore, a "remembering back
*\[Wiedererinnerung\]*."^[]{#calibre_link-500}[34](#calibre_link-89){.nounder}^
It is thus through the notion of an *active* forgetfulness that
Nietzsche, Derrida believes, gives Heidegger the slip. To recall the
passage from Derrida that I have already quoted, the "laughter" of the
Over-man will not be a "memorial or ... guard of the ... form of the
house and the truth of Being. He will dance, outside of the
house,[]{#calibre_link-1430} this ... active forgetfulness."

Heidegger stands between Derrida and Nietzsche. Almost on every occasion
that Derrida writes of Nietzsche, Heidegger's reading is invoked. It is
as if Derrida discovers his Nietzsche through and against Heidegger. In
the *Grammatology*, he writes: "... rather than protect Nietzsche from
the Heideggerian reading, we should perhaps offer him up to it
completely, underwriting[]{#calibre_link-1431} that interpretation
without reserve; in a *certain way* and up to the point where, the
content of the Nietzschean discourse being almost lost for the question
of being, its form regains its absolute strangeness, where his text
finally invokes a different type of reading, more faithful to his type
of writing." (32, 19)

Heidegger describes Nietzsche as the last metaphysician of the West. For
Heidegger[]{#calibre_link-1432} a metaphysician is one who asks the
question "What is the being of the entity?" And, for Heidegger,
Nietzsche's answer to this question is---the being of the entity is the
will to power. And, as Heidegger has consistently pointed out, the place
for the posing of the question of the being of the entity is man.
Starting from this "metaphysical premise" Heidegger develops a
thoroughly coherent reading[]{#calibre_link-1433} of Nietzsche and
reminds us again and again that to consider Nietzsche incoherent is
simply not to grasp that his master-question is the same as that of all
Western metaphysics: "What is the being of the entity?" It is as if
Heidegger, philosopher of that special nostalgia for the original word,
resolutely refuses to recognize that Nietzsche's consistency is
established by virtue of an active[]{#calibre_link-1434} forgetfulness
the conditions for which are also inscribed in the Nietzschean text.

Heidegger often quotes a sentence from Nietzsche and declares "this
means. ..." Out of this highly didactic approach comes powerful formulae
such as the following:

We shall be able to determine the main thrust of Nietzche's metaphysical
premise, when we consider the answer that he gives to the question of
the *constitution*[]{#calibre_link-1435} of the entity and its *mode of
being. ...* Nietzsche gives two answers: the entity in its totality is
will to power, and the entity in its totality is the eternal return of
the same. ...In these two propositions ... "is" means different things.
The entity in totality "is" the will to power means: the entity as such
is constituted as that which Nietzsche determines as the will to power.
And the entity[]{#calibre_link-1436} in totality "is" the eternal return
of the same means the entity in totality *is* as entity in the mode of
the eternal return of the same. The determination "will to power"
answers the question of the entity *with reference
[]{#calibre_link-922}to its constitution;* the determination "eternal
return of the same" answers the question of the entity in totality *with
reference to its mode of being*. However, constitution
and[]{#calibre_link-1437} mode of being belong together as
determinations of the entity-ness of the
entity.^[]{#calibre_link-501}[35](#calibre_link-90){.nounder}^

Everything is made to fall into place in terms of the question of being.
That in Nietzsche concepts such as "entity" and "totality" are
profoundly problematized ("... there is no 'totality'; ... no evaluation
of human existence, of human aims, can be made in regard to something
that does not exist..." \[WM II. 169, WP 378\]), that Nietzsche almost
never speaks of the eternal return of the *same*, but
simply[]{#calibre_link-1440} of the eternal return---such massive
details are set aside. Nietzsche's mockery of "making equal," "making
same" (*Gleich*) is ignored in the energy of the Heideggerian copula
that equates the will to power and the eternal return of the *same
(Gleich): "Will to power is in essence and according to its inner
possibility the eternal return of the same." (HN* I. 467)

Because Heidegger does not acknowledge[]{#calibre_link-1441} the
plurality of Nietzsche's style, he does not allow Nietzsche the
privilege of being a philosopher of the "sous rature." For him,
Nietzsche remains a metaphysician who asks the question of being, but
does not question the questioning itself! "Neither Nietzsche nor any
thinker before him---also and exactly not Hegel, who before Nietzsche
for the first time thought the *history* of philosophy
philosophically---come[]{#calibre_link-1442} to the commencing
beginning, rather they see the beginning already and only in the light
of what is already a falling off from the beginning and a quietening of
the beginning: in the light of Platonic philosophy ... Nietzsche himself
already early on designates his philosophy as reversed Platonism. The
reversal does not eliminate the Platonic premise, but rather solidifies
it exactly[]{#calibre_link-1443} through the appearance of elimination."
(HN I. 469)

Within the encompassing and constricting frame of Nietzsche's
metaphysics *"as the metaphysics of subjectivity" (HN* II. 199),
Heidegger's reading of Nietzsche is superb. Unfortunately for my
interests, and Derrida's, it matters more at this point that Heidegger
feels compelled to bypass or explain away so much in Nietzsche. I
reserve the occasion[]{#calibre_link-1444} for a more thoroughgoing
critique of the Heideggerian text on Nietzsche. Here let me indicate
some sweeping instances. If Nietzsche speaks of the world and of our
sensations as chaos, Heidegger explains chaos as *"the exclusive
\[eigentümlich*\] *blueprint of the world in totality and its working.
...* 'Chaos' cannot simply mean waste confusion, but the secrecy of the
unsubdued domain of becoming." (*HN*[]{#calibre_link-1445} I. 566) Art
(whose status in Nietzsche is extremely elusive and
problematic)^[]{#calibre_link-502}[36](#calibre_link-91){.nounder}^ is
then described as the supreme will to power, which, giving form to
chaos, ("another sign-chain []{#calibre_link-1018}telescoped there,"
Nietzsche might mutter) is "the creative experience of becoming." (*HN*
I. 568) If Nietzsche invokes the body and the organism in general as
limits to consciousness, Heidegger brilliantly introduces
the[]{#calibre_link-1446} concept of "the bodying reason" and interprets
Nietzsche's gesture as the extension of the concept of subjectivity to
animality and the " 'body' ... \[as\] the name for that form of the will
to power in which the latter is immediately accessible to man as the
distinct 'subject'." (*HN* II. 300) When Nietzsche writes: "To impose
upon becoming the character of being---that is the supreme will to
power"[]{#calibre_link-1447} (WM II. 101, WP 330), Heidegger must read
it without benefit of the pervasive irony of Nietzsche's double stance.
He must even overlook the implications of the metaphor of imprinting
(*aufzuprägen*) that is translated as "to impose" in the English
version. He must often in practice overlook the fragmentary nature of
*The Will to Power*, as he must overlook the interrogative form of many
of Nietzsche's[]{#calibre_link-1448} most aggressive insights. He must
interpret the goal-lessness of the Over-man as "the unconditioned
mastery of man on earth. The man of this mastery is the Over-man." (*HN*
II. 125)

Derrida thinks there might be profit in pushing through a rigorously
Heideggerian reading of Nietzsche---a reading that would develop into
its ultimate coherence the Nietzsche who actively forgets the terrible
text of[]{#calibre_link-1449} his own "knowledge." At the limit such a
reading would break open, "its form re-cover its absolute strangeness,
and his text finally invoke another type of reading."

Derrida's own critique of Heidegger on Nietzsche---"La Question du
style"---seems to move around an apparently unimportant moment in the
Heideggerian text. The strategy of deconstruction, as we shall see
later, often fastens upon such[]{#calibre_link-1450} a small but
tell-tale moment. In this particular essay, the moment is Heidegger's
overlooking of the words "it *becomes a woman"* in the chapter entitled
"How the 'True World' Ultimately Became a Fable: the History of An
Error," in Nietzche's *The Twilight of the
Idols*.^[]{#calibre_link-503}[37](#calibre_link-92){.nounder}^

Nietzsche's brief chapter gives the history of Western metaphysics in
six formulaic paragraphs with accompanying "stage
directions,"[]{#calibre_link-1451} written in a peculiarly Nietzschean
tone of jest in earnest. At the moment when metaphysics changes from
Platonism to Christianity, "the idea ... *becomes a woman."* Heidegger
takes no notice of this in his extended commentary on the chapter. At
that omission Derrida fixes his glance, and in a bold and most
surprising gesture, illuminates the "question of style" in Nietzsche
through a discussion of[]{#calibre_link-1452} the "question of woman."

A general reading of Nietzsche's text would see him as a raging
misogynist. But Derrida's careful reading disengages a more complex
collection of attitudes toward woman. Derrida breaks them into three and
suggests []{#calibre_link-1015}that each Nietzschean attitude is
contiguous with a psychoanalytical "position"---a modality of the
subject's relationship with the object. Summarized, the
"positions"[]{#calibre_link-1453} would be as follows:

The woman ... condemned as ... figure or power of lying. ... He was, he
feared such a castrated woman....

The woman ... condemned as ... figure or power of truth. ... He was, he
feared such a castrating woman. ...

The woman ... recognized, beyond this double negation, affirmed as the
affirmative, dissimulating, artistic, Dionysiac. ... He was, he loved
such an affirmative woman. (*QS* 265, 267)

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1454}
:::

By means of an elaborate argument on the question of style, Derrida
cautions us that these three positions cannot be reconciled into a unity
or even an "exhaustive code." (*QS* 266) But if, that warning heeded, we
were to concentrate here on the tripartite schema, and glance again at
the "History of An Error," we might distill a Derridean reading of
Nietzsche.

According to Nietzsche, with the coming[]{#calibre_link-1455} of
Christianity, the period of castration began, and the idea, become a
(castrating and castrated) woman, was pursued by the male type of the
philosopher for possession and appropriation. Nietzsche is caught up
within this scheme, speaks *for* men, proposes an *Over-man*. But his
text is capable of pointing out that the woman undermines the act of
masculine possession by "giving herself" (in the
sense[]{#calibre_link-1456} of playing a part, *playing* herself), even
in the act of "giving herself" up to sexual
mastery.^[]{#calibre_link-504}[38](#calibre_link-93){.nounder}^ About
this "truth as woman," one cannot then ask, "what is she?"---the
ontological question---and expect an answer---the hermeneutic
assumption: "Each time that the question of the proper \[of the
self-same, of appropriation, of knowledge as possession\] emerges, ...
the onto-hermeneutic form of interrogation[]{#calibre_link-1457} shows
its limit." (*QS* 274) In the very act of surrender, woman dissimulates.
Here we find a sexual description of that double register of
knowledge-forgetfulness that forever ruptures Nietzsche's style. To
possess the woman, one must *be* the woman ("the contemplative character
... consists of male mothers" \[NW V. ii. 106, GS 129\]), and yet the
being of the woman is unknown. The masculine style
of[]{#calibre_link-1458} possession through the stylus, the stiletto,
the spurs, breaks down as protection against the enigmatic femininity of
truth. "Perhaps truth is a woman who has reasons for not letting us see
her reasons? Perhaps her name is---to speak Greek---Baubo \[female
genitals\]?" (NW V. ii. 20, GS 38) "Even the compassionate curiosity of
the wisest student of humanity is inadequate for guessing how this or
that woman[]{#calibre_link-1459} manages to accommodate herself to this
solution of the \[sexual\] riddle ... and how the ultimate philosophy
and skepsis of woman casts anchor at this point!" (NW V. ii. 105, GS
128) Once we are put on the trail, the surprising passages appear, the
text begins to open. Man must constantly attempt to *be* the truth as
[]{#calibre_link-923}woman (articulate forgetfulness) in order to *know*
her, which is impossible. "Man and[]{#calibre_link-1460} woman change
places, exchange their masks to infinity" (*QS* 273). Is Derrida
suggesting that, in questioning a recoverable and possessable originary
"truth," Nietzsche is symbolically questioning, as Freud did, the
reality of a "primal scene," of things in general being taken to have
begun with the castration of the phallus, with the distinct division
into man and woman?

Is Nietzsche's desire[]{#calibre_link-1461} (as Derrida sees it) to
place the castrating idea *within* history akin to Freud's rewriting of
the primal "scene" into the child's primal
"fantasy?"^[]{#calibre_link-505}[39](#calibre_link-94){.nounder}^ Is the
Nietzschean text, in suggesting that in order to *have* (possess) the
truth (woman) the philosopher must *be* the truth (woman), undoing
Freud's incipient phallocentrism, which provides quite a different
alternative: if the son (man) disavows[]{#calibre_link-1462} sexual
difference, he seeks to *be the phallus for* the mother (woman) and
becomes "the lost object;" when the sexual difference is acknowledged,
the son (man) *has* the phallus through identification with the father.
Is Nietzsche seeking to undo that "repudiation of femininity" in the
male---the other side of which is possession---that Freud posits as
"nothing else than a biological fact" (GW XVI. 99,[]{#calibre_link-1463}
SE XXIII. 252), and describe a femininity that is not defined by a male
desire to supply a
lack?^[]{#calibre_link-506}[40](#calibre_link-95){.nounder}^

(Perhaps Derrida's Nietzsche goes "beyond" Derrida's Hegel. His
consistent contraction for the Hegelian *savoir absolu* \[absolute
knowledge\] in *Glas* is *Sa*. Not only is this a misspelling of "ça"
\[id, it\], and the usual French contraction for "signifiant"
\[signifier\], but also a possessive pronoun[]{#calibre_link-1464} with
a feminine object, which in this case is unnamed. Absolute knowledge as
articulated by Hegel might be caught within the will to an unnamed
\[unnamable\] "chose féminine" \[female thing---in every sense\].)

Derrida ends his essay with yet another long cautionary passage about
the problem of reading
Nietzsche,^[]{#calibre_link-507}[41](#calibre_link-96){.nounder}^ of the
fact that in his text in particular, as we have tried to explain, one
consistent[]{#calibre_link-1465} reading continually erases itself and
invokes its opposite, and so on indefinitely: "Do not conclude from this
that one must give up immediately the knowledge of what *it* means. ...
To be aware, as rigorously as possible, of that structural limit ... one
must push this deciphering as far as possible. ... If Nietzsche meant
\[wanted to say\] something, would it not be this limit of meaning \[the
will to[]{#calibre_link-1466} say\], as the effect of a will to power
necessarily differential, therefore always divided, folded, multiplied?
... As much as to say that there would no longer be a 'totality of
Nietzsche's text,' even fragmentary or aphoristic." (*QS* 285)

And, inaugurating for us an attitude that I shall develop later in this
Preface, Derrida writes: "The text can always remain at the same time
open, proffered *[]{#calibre_link-1467}and* indecipherable, even without
our knowing that it is indecipherable." (QS 286)

[]{#calibre_link-902}I should note here that Derrida always makes a
ritual (and undoubtedly correct) gesture of dismissal toward these
fathers: "It was within concepts inherited from metaphysics that
Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger worked." (*ED* 413, *SC* 251) Heidegger
came close to undoing them, "destroying" them (Heidegger's word),
but[]{#calibre_link-1468} gave in to them as well. Freud nearly always
believed that he worked within them. But Nietzsche cracked them apart
and then advocated forgetting that fact! Perhaps this entire argument
hangs on who *knew* how much of what he was doing. The will to knowledge
is not easy to discard. When Derrida claims for himself that he is
within yet without the clôture of metaphysics, is the difference not
precisely[]{#calibre_link-1469} that he *knows* it at least? It is
difficult to imagine a solution to the problem that would go beyond
Nietzsche's: to know and then actively to forget, convincingly to offer
in his text his own misreading.

In *Cartesian Meditations*, Edmund Husserl differentiates between a
"transcendental phenomenology of consciousness" and a "pure psychology
of consciousness," the former a study where "the
psychic[]{#calibre_link-1470} components of man ... data belonging to
the world ... \[are\] not accepted as actuality, but only as an
actuality-phenomenon," declaring them, however, an "exact parallel."
Here is another distinction that a Nietzschean vision must
undo.^[]{#calibre_link-508}[42](#calibre_link-97){.nounder}^ And for
Derrida, it is Freud who points toward a working of the psyche that
"obliterates the transcendental distinction between the origin of the
world and Being-in-the-world.[]{#calibre_link-1471} Obliterates it while
producing it."^[]{#calibre_link-509}[43](#calibre_link-98){.nounder}^
Derrida does not look at psychoanalysis as a particular or "regional"
discipline, but a way of reading that unscrambles "the founding
concept-words of ontology, of being in its privilege" (35, 21). For his
purposes, in other words, it is not a science that necessarily provides
a correct picture of the psychic norm and prescribes cures for the
abnormal, but[]{#calibre_link-1472} rather teaches, through its own use
thereof, a certain method of deciphering any text.

Whether he acknowledges it or not, Freud implies that the psyche is a
sign-structure "sous rature," for, like the sign, it is inhabited by a
radical alterity, what is totally other---"Freud gives it \[this radical
alterity\] a metaphysical name, the unconscious" (*MP* 21, *SP* 151):
"The unconscious is the true psychical[]{#calibre_link-1473} reality;
*in its innermost nature it is as much unknown to us as the reality of
the external world, and it is as incompletely presented by the data of
consciousness as is the external world by the communications of our
sense-organs."* (*GW* II--III. 617--18, *SE* V. 613) And, when he
"substitutes" for "the antithesis between" "the conscious and the
unconscious" that between the ego and the id (the
it,[]{#calibre_link-1474} the other), the notion of alterity remains
undisturbed: "the id ... is its \[the ego's\] other external world
*\[seine andere Aussenwelt\]."* (*GW* XIII. 285, *SE* XIX. 55) This
alterity can never be made present as such to the consciousness, which
has []{#calibre_link-912}dealings only with the preconscious, an area
between itself and the unconscious. "To consciousness the whole sum of
psychic processes presents itself as the[]{#calibre_link-1475} realm of
the preconscious." (GW X. 290, *SE* XIV. 191) Yet "unconscious wishes
always remain active. ... Indeed it is a prominent feature of
unconscious processes that they are indestructible." (*GW* II--III. 583,
*SE* V. 577)

Something that carries within itself the trace of a perennial alterity:
the structure of the psyche, the structure of the sign. To this
structure Derrida gives the name "writing."[]{#calibre_link-1476} The
sign cannot be taken as a homogeneous unit bridging an origin (referent)
and an end (meaning), as "semiology," the study of signs, would have it.
The sign must be studied "under erasure," always already inhabited by
the trace of another sign which never appears as such. "Semiology" must
give place to "grammatology." As I have suggested, this move relates
closely to Nietzsche's "genealogical"[]{#calibre_link-1477} study of
morals as unending "sign-chains."

"Writing," then, is the name of the structure always already inhabited
by the trace. This is a broader concept than the empirical concept of
writing, which denotes an intelligible system of notations on a material
substance. This broadening, Derrida feels, is accomplished by Freud's
use of the metaphor of writing to describe both the content and
the[]{#calibre_link-1478} machinery of the psyche. In an essay
translated as "Freud and the Scene of Writing," itself an example of the
rhetorical analysis of "philosophical" texts that Nietzsche spoke of,
Derrida traces the emergence of the metaphor of writing through three
texts placed along a thirty-year span in Freud's career: "Project for A
Scientific Psychology" (1895), *The Interpretation of Dreams* (1899) and
"A[]{#calibre_link-1479} Note Upon the 'Mystic Writing-Pad' " (1925).
Through these three texts Freud had grappled with the problem of finding
a description for the content as well as the apparatus of the psyche.
With the 1925 "Note," Freud arrives at last at a description of the
psyche as a "space of writing." This is indeed not our empirical concept
of writing, for here "script ... is never subject, extrinsic, and
posterior[]{#calibre_link-1480} to the spoken word." (*ED* 296, *FF* 75)
Nor is it simply a metaphor for language. In the *Interpretation*, the
dream-content---a paradigm of the entire memory-work of the psyche---"is
expressed ... in a pictographic \[not phonetic\] script." (GW II--III.
283, SE IV. 277) In the "Note," with its elaborate evocation of an
actual writing toy, the question of the place of speech simply does not
arise: "I do not[]{#calibre_link-1481} think it is too far-fetched to
compare the celluloid and waxed paper cover with the system *Pcpt.--Cs*.
\[perception-consciousness\] and its protective shield, the wax slab
with the unconscious behind them, and the appearance \[becoming-visible;
*Sichtbarwerden\]* and disappearance of the writing with the
flickering-up and passing away of consciousness in the process of
perception." (GW XIV. 7, SE XIX.[]{#calibre_link-1482} 230--31) In the
last two chapters of the *Interpretation*, meditating in great detail
[]{#calibre_link-1483}upon "The Dream-Work" and "The Psychology of the
Dream-Process," Freud is compelled, at the risk of some self-bafflement,
to explode the idea of any unified agency for the psyche. By the time
Freud comes to write the "Note," he has clearly established that the
workings of the psychic apparatus are themselves
not[]{#calibre_link-1484} accessible to the psyche. It is this apparatus
that "receives" the stimuli from the outside world. The psyche is
"protected" from these stimuli. What we think of as "perception" is
always already an inscription. If the stimuli lead to permanent
"memory-traces"---marks which are *not* a part of conscious memory, and
which will constitute the play of the psyche far removed from the time
of the reception[]{#calibre_link-1485} of the stimuli---there is no
conscious perception. "The inexplicable phenomenon of consciousness
arises \[periodically and irregularly\] in the perceptual system instead
of the permanent traces." (GW XIV. 4--5, SE XIX. 228) There are periods,
then, when the perceptual system is not activated and that is precisely
when the lasting constitution of the psyche is being determined. It is
only the periods[]{#calibre_link-1486} of its actual activation that
gives us the sense of time. "Our abstract idea of time seems to be
wholly derived from the method of the working of the system *Pcpt.--Cs*.
and to correspond to a perception on its own part \[self-perception;
*Selbstwahrnehmung\]* of that method of working." (GW XIII. 28, SE XVIII
28) In the "Note," Freud undermines that primary bastion of
selfhood---the continuity of
time-perception---both[]{#calibre_link-1487} more boldly and more
tentatively; our sense of the continuity of time is a function of the
discontinuous periodicity of the perceptual machine and, indeed, a
perception of nothing more than the working of that machine: "this
discontinuous method of functioning of the system *Pcpt.--Cs*. lies at
the bottom of the formation *\[Entstehung* rather than
origin---*Ursprung\]* of the concept of time." (*GW*
XIV.[]{#calibre_link-1488} 8, *SE* XIX. 231) Thus, within the Freudian
thematics of the psyche, perception is an "originary inscription." And
time, according to Kant the privileged and necessary "form of
intuition," becomes a mark of "the economy of a writing" (ED 334, FF
112) on the mystic writing pad of the psyche.

Nietzsche had undone the sovereign self by criticizing causality and
substance. He had indicated our ignorance[]{#calibre_link-1489} of the
minute particulars involved in a "single" human action. Freud undoes the
sovereign self by meditating upon those minute particulars.

Freud's slow discovery of the metaphor of writing is so fascinating for
Derrida because it does not have the usual strings attached. In the
section "The Signifier and Truth" of the *Grammatology*, Derrida
discusses one curious characteristic of the
general[]{#calibre_link-1490} usage of the metaphor of writing: even as
it is used, it is contrasted to writing in the literal sense. "Writing
in the common sense is the dead letter, it is the carrier of death
\[because it signifies the absence of the speaker\]. ... From another
point of view, on the other face of the same proposition, writing in the
metaphoric sense, natural, []{#calibre_link-913}divine, and living
writing, is venerated; it is equal[]{#calibre_link-1491} in dignity to
the origin of value, to the voice of conscience as divine law, to the
heart, to sentiment and so forth." (29, 17) Because human beings need to
comfort themselves with notions of presence, writing in the "literal"
sense, signifying the absence of the actual author, must be "rejected,"
even when it is "accepted" as a metaphor. Freud's use of the metaphor of
writing is uncontaminated[]{#calibre_link-1492} by this double dealing.
In fact, Freud speculates that the very mansion of presence, the
perceiving self, is shaped by absence, and---writing.

The clôture of metaphysics found the origin and end of its study in
presence. The questioners of that enclosure---among them Nietzsche,
Freud, Heidegger---moved toward an articulation of the need for the
strategy of "sous rature." Nietzsche puts "knowing"
under[]{#calibre_link-1493} erasure; Freud "the psyche," and Heidegger,
explicitly, "Being." As I have argued, the name of this gesture effacing
the presence of a thing and yet keeping it legible, in Derrida's
lexicon, is "writing,"---the gesture that both frees us from and guards
us within, the metaphysical enclosure.

Freud does not put the psyche under erasure merely by declaring it to be
inhabited by a radical alterity;[]{#calibre_link-1494} nor by declaring
perception and temporality to be functions of a writing. He does it also
by his many avowed questionings of that same topological fable of the
mind that he constantly uses. It does not seem correct to unproblematize
Freud's different models for the psychic system and call them "varying
'points of view' used by Freud to represent the psychic
system."^[]{#calibre_link-510}[44](#calibre_link-99){.nounder}^ The
point is that Freud uses[]{#calibre_link-1495} the dynamic (play of
forces) or functional picture of the psyche almost to annul the
topological one; yet gives the topological picture greatest usage; the
typical sleight of hand of "sous rature." Not only does he write that he
will "carefully avoid the temptation to determine psychical locality in
any anatomical fashion" (GW II--III. 541, SE V. 536); but, he points out
that, even within the "virtual"[]{#calibre_link-1496} psychical
topography

an unconscious thought seeking to convey \[translate\] itself *\[nach
Ubersetzung\]* into the preconscious so as to be able to force its way
through into consciousness ... is not the forming of a second thought
situated in a new place, like a transcription that continues to exist
alongside the original; and the notion of forcing a way through into
consciousness must be kept carefully[]{#calibre_link-1497} free from any
idea of a change of locality. ... What we are doing here is once again
to replace a topological way of representing things by a dynamic one.
... Nevertheless, I consider it expedient and justifiable to continue to
make use of the figurative image of the two systems. (GW II--III.
614--15, *SE* V. 610--11)

Some fifteen years later, writing on the Unconscious, Freud assures us:
"Study of the[]{#calibre_link-1498} derivatives of the *Ucs*. will
completely disappoint our expectations of a schematically clear-cut
distinction between the two psychical systems." (GW X. 289, SE XIV. 190)

[]{#calibre_link-910}And yet the topographical fable continues to be
used, to my mind precisely because it is a graphically representable
one---a "structure" in that orthodox sense. Freud has dismantled the
sovereignty of the self; his topographical[]{#calibre_link-1499}
description allows him to suggest the production of that self in the
structuring of the text of the psyche. Derrida will say: "It is only
necessary to reconsider the problem of the effect of subjectivity as it
is produced by the structure of the text." (*Pos* F 122, *Pos* E 45)

"I propose that when we have succeeded in describing a psychical process
in its dynamic, topographical and economic
aspects,"[]{#calibre_link-1500} Freud writes, "we should speak of it as
a *metapsychological* presentation." (GW X. 281, SE XIV. 181) The notion
of an "economic" presentation of a mental process is pertinent to a
reading of Derrida.

Economy is a metaphor of energy---where two opposed forces playing
against each other constitute the so-called identity of a phenomenon. In
Freud's "metapsychological presentations," the economic
line[]{#calibre_link-1501} of approach comes to modify the topographic
and dynamic ones, although, as I suggest above, the other descriptions
are never given up. "The ultimate things which psychological research
can learn about \[are\] the behavior of the two primal instincts, their
distribution, mingling and defusion---things which we cannot think of as
being confined to a single province of the mental apparatus, the id,
the[]{#calibre_link-1502} ego or the super-ego. ... Only by the
concurrent or mutually opposing action"---in other words, economy---"of
the two primal instincts---Eros and the death-instinct---, never by one
or the other alone, can we explain the rich multiplicity
\[many-coloredness; *Buntheit\]* of the phenomena \[appearances,
*Erscheinungen\]* of life." (GW XVI. 88--89, SE XXIII, 242--43)

Economy is not a reconciliation of opposites, but[]{#calibre_link-1503}
rather a maintaining of disjunction. Identity constituted by difference
is economy. In Freud's world, a train of thought is sustained by its
opposite, a unit of meaning contains the possibility of its opposite:
"Each train of thought is almost invariably accompanied by its
contradictory counterpart, linked with it by antithetical association."
(GW II--III, 316, SE IV. 312) Normality---an "ideal
fiction"[]{#calibre_link-1504} (*GW* XVI. 80, *SE* XXIII, 235)---and
neurosis are accomplices: "Psycho-analytic research finds no
fundamental, but only quantitative, distinctions between normal and
neurotic life. ... We must recognize that the psychical mechanism
employed by neuroses is not created by the impact of a pathological
disturbance upon the mind, but is present already in the normal
structure of the mental apparatus." (GW[]{#calibre_link-1505} II--III.
378, 613; SE V. 373, 607) Following a similar strategy, Freud will
argue, after carefully developing a contrast between the pleasure
principle and the death instinct: "The pleasure principle seems actually
to serve the death instincts." (GW XIII. 69, SE XVIII. 63) The
exposition of the death instinct itself is made in terms of a bold
economy of life and inertia: []{#calibre_link-942}"The inertia inherent
in[]{#calibre_link-1506} organic life." (GW XIII. 38, SE XVIII. 36) We
are not surprised when Freud proposes an economy of the body and the
mind: "... the activity of thinking is also supplied from the
sublimation of erotic motive forces." (GW XIII. 274, SE XIX. 45) Not
only are we within the ambiance of that undoing-preserving of opposites
that Derrida finds congenial also in Nietzsche; this last passage in
fact advances[]{#calibre_link-1507} what Nietzsche calls the "new
psychology" as he points at the need for combining "philology" (the
genealogy of language) and "physiology" (the field of the erotic).

I have cited above the Freudian argument that the establishment of
permanent traces in the psychic apparatus precludes the possibility of
immediate perception. Relating this delaying mechanism to the economy of
opposites, Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1508} writes: "Following a schema
that continually guides Freud's thinking, the movement of the trace is
described as an effort of life to protect itself *by deferring* the
dangerous investment, by constituting a reserve (*Vorrat*). And all the
conceptual oppositions that furrow Freudian thought relate each concept
to the other like movements of a detour, within the economy of
differance. The one is only[]{#calibre_link-1509} the other deferred,
the one differing from the other." (MP 19--20, SP 150)

This passage is taken from the essay "La différance." It emphasizes the
presence of Freud in the articulation of what comes close to becoming
Derrida's master-concept---"differance" spelled with an "a." Let us
fasten on three moments in the quotation---"differing," "deferring," and
"detour." I have spoken of the radically other,[]{#calibre_link-1510}
which is always different, nonidentical. Add to this the structure of
the perennial postponement of that which is constituted only through
postponement. The two together---"difference" and "deferment"---both
senses present in the French verb "différer," and both "properties" of
the sign under erasure---Derrida calls "différance." This
differance---being the structure (a structure never quite
there,[]{#calibre_link-1511} never by us perceived, itself deferred and
different) of our psyche---is also the structure of "presence," a term
itself under erasure. For differance, producing the differential
structure of our hold on "presence," never produces presence as such.

The structure of "presence" is thus constituted by difference and
deferment. But since the "subject" that "perceives" presence is also
constituted similarly,[]{#calibre_link-1512} differance is neither
active nor passive. The "-ance" ending is the mark of that suspended
status. Since the difference between "difference" and "differance" is
inaudible, this "neographism" reminds us of the importance of writing as
a structure. The "a" serves to remind us that, even within the graphic
structure, the perfectly spelled word is always absent, constituted
through an endless[]{#calibre_link-1513} series of spelling mistakes.

In "La différance," Derrida relates the thought of differance to
Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger. But he seems most moved by the Freudian
break []{#calibre_link-911}through. The disjunction between perception
and the permanent trace seems to make thought itself a differance of
perception. The complicity between the organism and the inertia of the
inorganic state makes life a differance[]{#calibre_link-1514} of death
(ED 333 n., FF 112 n.). Through these Freudian insights, and Freud's
notion that our perception of unconscious traces occur long "after the
event," Derrida consolidates what he had spotted in Husserl's
structuring of the Living Present in his Introduction to *The Origin of
Geometry:* "the pure consciousness of delay." (p. 171)

Derrida quotes from *Beyond the Pleasure Principle:* "Under
the[]{#calibre_link-1515} influence of the ego's instincts of
self-preservation, the pleasure principle is replaced by the reality
principle. This latter principle does not abandon the intention of
ultimately obtaining pleasure, but it nevertheless demands and carries
into effect the postponement of satisfaction, the abandonment of a
number of possibilities of gaining satisfaction and the temporary
toleration of unpleasure[]{#calibre_link-1516} as a step on the long
indirect road (*Aufschub*) to pleasure." Within Freud's discourse,
Derrida relates this postponement (deferment) and "the relation to the
absolutely other \[differance\] that apparently breaks up any economy"
by arguing as follows:

The economic character of differance in no way implies that the deferred
presence can always be recovered, that it simply amounts to an
investment[]{#calibre_link-1517} that only temporarily and without loss
delays the presentation of presence. ... The unconscious is not ... a
hidden, virtual, and potential self-presence. ... There is no chance
that the mandating subject "exists" somewhere, that it is present or is
"itself," and still less chance that it will become conscious. ... This
radical alterity, removed from every possible mode of presence, is
characterized by[]{#calibre_link-1518} ... delayed effects. In order to
describe them, in order to read the traces of the "unconscious" traces
(There are no "conscious" traces \[since the traces are marked precisely
when there is no *conscious* perception\]), the language of presence or
absence, the metaphysical speech of phenomenology, is in principle
inadequate. (*MP* 21. *SP* 152)

Here I must repeat, with modifications, a question that
I[]{#calibre_link-1519} broached at the end of our discussion of
Nietzsche, and perhaps attempt a partial answer to it: the question of
mastery through knowledge in Derrida. Nietzsche had discovered the need
to sustain disjunction, to love fate, cultivate *amor fati*. But his
entire idiom of thought and action was to place the responsibility upon
a self whose existence he argued against. His text became the violent
and[]{#calibre_link-1520} deliberate playground of differance. Freud
allowed Derrida to think that the philosophic move did not necessarily
require a Nietzschean violence. Simply to recognize that one is shaped
by differance, to recognize that the "self" is constituted by its
never-fully-to-be-recognized-ness, is enough. We do not have to
cultivate forgetfulness or the love of chance; we *are* the play of
chance and necessity.[]{#calibre_link-1521} There is no harm in the will
to knowledge; for the will to ignorance plays with it to constitute
it---if we []{#calibre_link-943}long to know we obviously long also to
be duped, since knowledge is duping. Nietzsche on the other hand saw the
*"active* forgetfulness of the question of being" as a gigantic
ebullience. Perhaps it is after all a difference in metaphorical nuance.
Derrida's understanding of such a
forgetfulness---via[]{#calibre_link-1522} Freud's research into
memory---is that it is active in the shaping of our "selves" in spite of
"ourselves." We are surrendered to its inscription. Perhaps, as I have
argued, in the long run what sets "Derrida" apart is that he *knows*
that he is always already surrendered to writing as he writes. His
knowledge *is*, after all, his power. Nietzsche, paradoxically, *knew*
even this, so that his affirmative[]{#calibre_link-1523} and active
(knowing) forgetfulness was a move against the inevitability of a
knowledge symptomatically priding itself on remembering. It is curious
that, speaking to Jean-Louis Houdebine about his strategy in an
interview, Derrida remarks again and again, "But I knew what I was
doing."^[]{#calibre_link-511}[45](#calibre_link-100){.nounder}^ The will
to power is not so easy to elude. It is also curious that, although
Derrida speaks often of Nietzsche's[]{#calibre_link-1524} explosive and
affirmative and open play, he speaks rarely of Freud's own analysis of
play as a restrictive gesture of power---most significantly in Freud's
comments on the child's game of *"fort-da,"* where the very economy of
absence and presence is brought under control. (GW XIII. 11--15, SE
XVIII. 14--17)

Yet, if we respect Derrida's discourse, we cannot catch him out so
easily. What does it show[]{#calibre_link-1525} but that he is after all
caught and held by the metaphysical enclosure even as he questions it,
that his text, as all others, is open to an interpretation that he has
done a great deal to describe? He does not succeed in applying his own
theory perfectly, for the successful application is forever deferred.
Differance/writing/trace as a structure is no less than a prudent
articulation of the Nietzschean[]{#calibre_link-1526} play of knowledge
and forgetfulness.

(After this writing, I heard Derrida's as yet unpublished lectures on
Francis Ponge and Heidegger, delivered at Yale in the fall of 1975. He
himself opens the question of differance and mastery there as the
question of the desire of deconstruction. I present his argument briefly
at the end of Section IV.)

Derrida receives from Freud an actual method of
deciphering[]{#calibre_link-1527} in the narrow sense as well. One
important distinction between the Heideggerean method of "destruction"
(see page xlviii), and Derrida's "de-construction" is the latter's
attention to the minute detailing of a text, not only to the syntax but
to the shapes of the words in it. Derrida is fascinated by Freud's
notion that dreams may treat "words" as "things." The analytical method
used in[]{#calibre_link-1528} [Part II](#calibre_link-101){.nounder} of
the *Grammatology* remains conservative from this point of view, and
generally honors the outline of the word as such. Starting with
[]{#calibre_link-914}*La dissémination*, however, Derrida begins to
notice the play of revelation and concealment lodged within *parts* of
individual words. The tendency becomes pervasive in *Glas*, where the
individual phonemes/graphemes constituting words are often evoked out
into[]{#calibre_link-1529} an independent dance. Derrida pushes through
to an extreme Freud's own method of attending to the "syntax" of a dream
text. I give below Freud's skeletal summary of the rich and complex
method.

In *The Interpretation of Dreams*, he lists the four techniques employed
by the dream-work of the psychic apparatus to distort or "refract" the
dream-thought (psychic content) to produce the
pictographic[]{#calibre_link-1530} script of the dream: condensation,
displacement, considerations of representability, and secondary
revision. "Condensation" and "displacement" may be rhetorically
translated as metaphor and
metonymy.^[]{#calibre_link-512}[46](#calibre_link-102){.nounder}^ The
third item on the list points at the technique which distorts an idea so
that it can be presented as an image. Freud's description of the fourth
item recalls Nietzsche's words on the will to[]{#calibre_link-1531}
power seeking to preserve unification, as well as Derrida's description
of the text in general: "A dream is a conglomerate which, for purposes
of investigation, must be broken up once more into fragments. ... A
psychical force is at work \[is displayed, *äussert\]* in dreams which
creates this apparent connectedness, which ... submits the material
produced by the dream-work to a 'secondary
revision.'[]{#calibre_link-1532} " (*GW* II--III. 451--52, *SE* V. 449)
I reopen the question of Freud and textuality on page lxxvi.

This notion that the verbal text is constituted by concealment as much
as revelation, that the concealment is itself a revelation and vice
versa, brings Nietzsche and Freud together. Freud suggests further that
where the subject is *not* in control of the text, where the text looks
super-smooth or superclumsy,[]{#calibre_link-1533} is where the reader
should fix his gaze, so that he does not merely read but deciphers the
text, and sees its play within the open textuality of thought, language,
and so forth within which it has only a provisionally closed outline. He
catches this notion thus: "There is often a passage in even the most
thoroughly interpreted dream which has to be left obscure. ... At that
point there is a[]{#calibre_link-1534} tangle of dream-thoughts which
cannot be unravelled and which moreover adds nothing to our knowledge of
the content of the dream." Derrida's "advance" on Freud here can be
formulated thus: this tangle cannot be unravelled in terms of, and adds
nothing to the contents of the dream-text within the limits set up by
itself. If, however, we have nothing vested in the putative identity of
the text or dream,[]{#calibre_link-1535} that passage is where we can
provisionally locate the text's moment of transgressing the laws it
apparently sets up for itself, and thus unravel---deconstruct---the very
text. This illuminates the lines in Freud that follow the passage above:
"This is the dream's navel, the spot where it reaches down into the
unknown. The dream-thoughts ... cannot ... have any definite endings:
they are bound to branch[]{#calibre_link-1536} out in
[]{#calibre_link-1537}every direction into the intricate network of our
world of thought." (*GW* II--III. 530, SE V. 525)

It is difficult to bring out the close yet necessarily oblique
relationship between Freud's and Derrida's methods of textual
interpretation without going into extreme detail. However, as Derrida
himself remarks, *Of Grammatology* and his earlier texts merely
inaugurate the participation in a[]{#calibre_link-1538} specifically
Freudian intertextuality. The erotic investment of writing in children
holds his interest in a long footnote on [page
132](#calibre_link-103){.nounder} (333). The elaboration of the
thematics of masturbation and writing, of the mark of supplementarity in
the chain of mother-substitutions, as Derrida locates them in Rousseau's
text, are psychoanalytical only in a very general sense. It should of
course be abundantly[]{#calibre_link-1539} clear that, even on so
general a plane, Derrida would not use a psychoanalytical method to
conduct us to "a psycho-biographical signified whose link with the
literary signifier then becomes perfectly extrinsic and contingent"
(228--29, 159). In fact, already in this early work, Derrida urges the
importance, for grammatology, of a psychoanalysis that has freed itself
from an attitude that sees[]{#calibre_link-1540} all textuality as a
dispensable source of substantive evidence. The use of the sexual
structures of psychoanalysis as a tool of interpretation becomes
steadily more marked in Derrida's later work. The essay on Nietzsche,
commenting on "the question of style" as the "question of woman" is an
example. And Derrida-Freud comes most disturbingly into his own in
*Glas*. I shall deal with Derrida's modification[]{#calibre_link-1541}
of the theme of castration in connection with his reading of Jacques
Lacan.

Derrida cautions us in a long headnote to "Freud and the Scene of
Writing" that, the institution of grammatology through the recognition
of systematic "repression" of writing throughout the history of the West
cannot be taken as a psychoanalytic endeavor on a macrocosmic scale. For
Freud's need to describe the coexistence[]{#calibre_link-1542} of the
(at least) double text of the psyche in terms of latent and manifest
contents, or, indeed, repression and sublimation, is itself caught
within that suspect terminology of binary oppositions; and further, the
very pattern of repression in an individual can only be possible because
of his need to reject all that is recognized to be inhabited by the
structure of writing: castration (the loss[]{#calibre_link-1543} of
mastery), penis-envy (the fear of absence). I shall later present
Derrida's counterarguments---dissemination and the hymen. Yet Freud
cannot be dismissed out of hand. Did he perhaps himself sense this need
to reject writing? Derrida ends "Freud and the Scene of Writing" with
this quotation from Freud's "Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety": "As
soon as writing, which entails making a liquid
flow[]{#calibre_link-1544} out of a tube on to a piece of white paper,
assumes the significance of copulation, or as soon as walking becomes a
symbolic substitute for treading upon the body of mother earth, both
writing and walking are stopped because they represent the performance
of []{#calibre_link-919}a forbidden sexual act." (*GW* XIV. 116, *SE*
XX. 90) Meanwhile, the word against Freud remains: "Necessity for an
immense work of deconstruction[]{#calibre_link-1545} of these concepts
and the metaphysical phrases that condense and sediment there." (*ED*
294) This can indeed be the ever-sustained word against all gestures of
surrender to precursors: As you follow, also deconstruct, for, as you
deconstruct, you must follow.

I maintain ... that Heidegger's text is of extreme importance, that it
constitutes an unprecedented, irreversible advance and that we are
still[]{#calibre_link-1546} very far from having exploited all its
critical resources. ... \[Yet there are\] propositions whose disorder
has ... disconcerted me. To cite one example, 'Derridian grammatics are
"modeled," in their broad outlines, on Heideggerian metaphors, which
they attempt to "deconstruct" by substituting for the "presence of the
logos" the anteriority of a trace; his grammatics become onto-theology
relying upon[]{#calibre_link-1547} the trace as their "basis,"
"foundation" or "origin."' (*Pos* F 73, 70, *Pos* EI 40, 39--40)

Taking issue against Elisabeth Roudinesco, whom he quotes above, Derrida
states his relationship to Heidegger and warns against false
descriptions of it. I have already considered his involvement in and
rewriting of the Heideggerian "sous rature," and his use of Heidegger as
a perspective on Nietzsche. Now[]{#calibre_link-1548} I glance briefly
at another aspect of Derrida's rewriting of Heidegger: the method of
deconstruction as practised by Heideggerian metaphysics.

What Derrida balks at in Roudinesco's description is that a
"grammatology"---science of the effacement of the trace---should be
described as modeled on a "metaphysics"---science of presence; that it
should be called an "onto-theology"---science of Being and
of[]{#calibre_link-1549} God as regulative presences, that the "trace,"
mark of radical anteriority, should be misnamed an "origin." We shall
note and avoid these errors; and go on to say, as does Derrida of
"differance": "By establishing this relation between a restricted
\[Heideggerian metaphysics\] and a general system \[grammatology\],"
Derrida "shifts and recommences the very project of philosophy." (*MP*
21, *SP* 151)

[]{#calibre_link-1550}Heidegger already points toward the relationship
between his own, and the grammatological methods, by ignoring, in his
practice of reading, the absolute authority of the text. When Heidegger
"reads" Hegel, or Kant, or Nietzsche, in the long run he "examine\[s\]
not what \[the author\] says but"---note the passive construction, the
withdrawal of authority from the sovereign author---"what is achieved."
(*[]{#calibre_link-1551}KPM* G 193, *KPM* E 221) He thinks of his own
task as a "loosening up" of the "hardened tradition" of "ontology" by a
*"positive*
destruction,"^[]{#calibre_link-513}[47](#calibre_link-104){.nounder}^ a
"destructive retrospect of the history of ontology" which "lays bare the
internal character or development" []{#calibre_link-825}of a text.
(*KPM* G 194, *KPM* E 222) (It is interesting to note that, in the first
published version of *De la grammatologie*, Derrida uses the word
"destruction"[]{#calibre_link-1552} in place of "deconstruction.")
Describing Derrida's own procedure, Paul de Man gives us something very
close to these Heideggerian passages: "His text, as he puts it so well,
is the unmaking of a construct. However negative it may sound,
deconstruction implies the possibility of
rebuilding."^[]{#calibre_link-514}[48](#calibre_link-105){.nounder}^
Because the author fancies himself sovereign, there is a point,
Heidegger suggests, where his own conception[]{#calibre_link-1553} of
the text blinds him: "Descartes had to neglect the question of Being
altogether"; "the doctrine of the schematism ... had to remain closed
off to Kant."^[]{#calibre_link-515}[49](#calibre_link-106){.nounder}^
Like the analyst moving with his patient in the seesaw of a
"transference-relationship," the deconstructing critic must "free and
... safeguard" the intrinsic powers "of a problem." (*KPM* G 185, *KPM*
E 211) In Derrida's words:

Reading must always[]{#calibre_link-1554} aim at a certain relationship,
unperceived by the writer, between what he commands and what he does not
command of the schemata of the language that he uses. This relationship
is not a certain quantitative distribution of shadow and light, of
weakness and force, but a signifying structure that critical reading
must *produce. ...* \[Without\] all the instruments of traditional
criticism, ... critical production[]{#calibre_link-1555} would risk
developing in any direction and authorize itself to say almost anything.
But this indispensable guard-rail has always only *protected*, never
*opened*, a reading (227, 158).

To take apart, to produce a reading, to open the textuality of a text.
Derrida shares these procedural guidelines with Heidegger. Freud has
helped to push the procedure further---given him some means of locating
the[]{#calibre_link-1556} text's "navel," as it were, the moment that is
undecidable in terms of the text's apparent system of meaning, the
moment in the text that seems to transgress its own system of values.
The desire for unity and order compels the author and the reader to
balance the equation that is the text's system. The deconstructive
reader exposes the grammatological structure of the text, that its
"origin" and its[]{#calibre_link-1557} "end" are given over to language
in general (what Freud would call "the unknown world of thought"), by
locating the moment in the text which harbors the unbalancing of the
equation, the sleight of hand at the limit of a text which cannot be
dismissed simply as a contradiction. In the *Grammatology*'s reading of
Rousseau, this "moment" is the double-edged word "supplement." In *La
pharmacie de Platon*[]{#calibre_link-1558}, it is the double-edged word
*"pharmakon"* as well as the absence of the word *"pharmakos."* In
Derrida's brief reading of Aristotle's *Physics* IV, it is the
unemphatic word *"ama,"* carrying the burden of differance. (*Dis*
69--197, MP 31--78)

One important difference between Heidegger and Derrida lies in their
concepts of time. Through a delicate analysis that I shall not attempt
to reproduce []{#calibre_link-903}here, Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1559}
demonstrates that, although Heidegger would purge Kant and
Hegel---indeed what Heidegger sees as the entire Aristotelian
tradition---of "the vulgar concept of time"---there can be no concept of
time that is not caught within the metaphysical clôture: "wishing to
produce that *other* concept, one quickly sees that it would be
constructed with other metaphysical or onto-theological predicates." (MP
73)^[]{#calibre_link-516}[50](#calibre_link-107){.nounder}^[]{#calibre_link-1560}
Heidegger catches a glimpse of this through his crossing-out of "Being."
At the stage of *Sein und Zeit*, however, Heidegger still thinks of
"time" as that which *"needs to be explicated originarily* \[einer
ursprünglichen Explikation\] *as the horizon for the understanding of
Being."^[]{#calibre_link-517}[51](#calibre_link-108){.nounder}^* Time is
still the model of pure auto-affection, where something ideal---Being
*as such---is* produced without having to relate[]{#calibre_link-1561}
to an object. (Derrida puts auto-affection in question and suggests that
it always already carries an irreducible element of hetero-affection,
desiring and relating to an alterity, which in this case is the
*question* of Being---or Being under erasure.) For the earlier
Heidegger, then, the "question of Being," as Derrida points out in
"Ousia et grammè," seem interchangeable. By the time of *Der
Spruch[]{#calibre_link-1562} des
Anaximander,^[]{#calibre_link-518}[52](#calibre_link-109){.nounder}^*
Heidegger himself sees Being as precomprehended and nonsignifiable, and
the *presence* seemingly signified in a text is seen as the only means
for language to point at the effaced *trace* (MP 76--77). Heidegger has
by then arrived at the crossing-out of being, and does not find the
meaning of being in temporality. But time itself seems more effectively
crossed out for Derrida through[]{#calibre_link-1563} the Freudian
suggestion that time is the discontinuous perception of the psychic
machinery.

Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger. All three concerned with a problem that
Heidegger would articulate thus: *"More originary* \[ursprünglich\]
*than man is the finitude of the* Dasein *in him." (KPM* G 207, KPM E
237) All three proto-grammatologues. Nietzsche a philosopher who cut
away the grounds of knowing. Freud[]{#calibre_link-1564} a psychologist
who put the psyche in question. Heidegger an ontologist who put Being
under erasure. It was for Derrida to "produce" their intrinsic power and
"discover" grammatology, the science of the "sous rature." That sleight
of hand is contained in the name itself, "the logos of the grammè." The
grammè is the written mark, the name of the sign "sous rature." "Logos"
is at one extreme "law" and[]{#calibre_link-1565} at the other
"phonè"---the voice. As we have seen, the grammè would question the
authority of the law, deconstruct the privilege of the spoken word. The
word "Grammatology" thus appropriately *keeps alive* an unresolved
contradiction. Derrida sets forth the meaning of this contradiction in
the section of our book entitled "Of Grammatology as A Positive
Science." And the texts of Nietzsche, Freud,[]{#calibre_link-1566} and
Heidegger are this contradiction's pre-text.

[]{#calibre_link-972}(The importance of the text of Edmund Husserl for
Derrida lies precisely in its self-conflict. Husserl seems to Derrida to
be a more than usually resolute suppressor of the more than usually
astute grammatological suggestions implied by the Husserlian text.)

It is of course futile to trace the origin of a particular thought: "We
know that the[]{#calibre_link-1567} metaphor that would describe the
genealogy of a text correctly is still *forbidden"* (149, 101). Yet one
might wonder if the thought of "writing" in Derrida is not a sort of
answer to the question of "geometry" in Husserl. As I have mentioned,
Derrida's first book is a translation of and introduction to Husserl's
"Origin of Geometry." The question asked by Husserl is precisely a
question of the[]{#calibre_link-1568} relationship between subjective
and objective structures. How can the forms of an absolutely ideal
objectivity---the essence of geometry (not actual systems of geometry)
arise within the structures of the subject? At the end of his long
introduction, Derrida suggests that Husserl's answer, if "produced"
fully, would be that the possibility of objectivity is lodged within the
subject's self-presence.[]{#calibre_link-1569} The transcendental
subject's ideal object is itself. In its contemplation of itself the
self cannot remain within the "simple now-ness of a Living Present," it
must give itself a history, differentiate itself from itself through a
backward glance which also makes possible a forward glance: "An
originary consciousness of delay can only have the pure form of
anticipation. ... Without this \[consciousness\][]{#calibre_link-1570}
... discourse and history \[and Geometry as the possibility of history\]
would not be possible."

Through these notions of self-differentiation and self-postponement,
Husserl seems to be launching the idea of differance: "The originary
Differance of the absolute Origin ... is *perhaps* what has always been
said through the concept of the *'transcendental.' ...* This strange
procession of a 'Rückfrage' \[checking[]{#calibre_link-1571} back\], is
the movement *sketched* in 'The Origin of
Geometry.'"^[]{#calibre_link-519}[53](#calibre_link-110){.nounder}^ The
idea is *perhaps* there in Husserl, and if so, it is only *sketched*.
For, as we shall see later in my discussion of phonocentrism, Husserl
surrounds this idea of differance with a constituting subject, a subject
that generates and is therefore the absolute origin of the structure of
difference. To win Husserl's thought, which
unwillingly[]{#calibre_link-1572} outlines the structures of
grammatology, into grammatological discourse, a massive rewriting will
have to be undertaken: "This determination of 'absolute subjectivity'
would ... have to be crossed out as soon as we conceive the present on
the basis of differance, and not the reverse. The concept of
*subjectivity* belongs *a priori* and *in general* to the order of the
*constituted* \[rather than the constituting\].[]{#calibre_link-1573}
... There is no constituting subjectivity. The very concept of
constitution itself must be deconstructed." (*VP* 94 n., *SP* 84--85 n.)

Not only in the field of subjectivity, but also in the field of
objective knowledge, Husserl seems to open as well as deliberately close
the possibility of grammatology. If there is an "indeterminately general
presumptive []{#calibre_link-968}horizon" of the knowable, Husserl
places it[]{#calibre_link-1574} within the control of an infinitely
synthesising directedness (intentionality) of the ego, an ego that can
be uncovered for the philosopher only by bracketing, " 'putting out of
play' of all positions taken toward the already-given Objective
world."^[]{#calibre_link-520}[54](#calibre_link-111){.nounder}^ If,
almost in spite of himself, Husserl seems to suggest that expression can
never be adequate to the sense which it expresses, he covers
himself[]{#calibre_link-1575} by giving to the "is" or to the
predicative statement a privilege. Once again, Derrida must undertake a
reversal. "It might then be thought \[following Husserl\] that the
*sense of being* has been limited by the imposition of *form*---which
... would, with the authority of the *is*, have assigned to the sense of
being the closure of presence, the form-of-presence, presence-in-form,
or form-presence. ... \[or\][]{#calibre_link-1576} that \[the\] thought
of form *\[pensée de la forme\]* has the power to extend itself beyond
the thought of being *\[pensée de l'être\]. ...* Our task is ... to
reflect on the circularity which makes the one pass into the other
indefinitely." (MP 206--07, SP 127--28)

Freud had found in the mystic writing pad a model that would contain the
problematics of the psyche---a virgin surface that still retained
permanent[]{#calibre_link-1577} traces. Husserl confronted a similar
problem when he posited a "sense" that is anterior to the act of
"expression" or "meaning." "How could we ever conceive," Derrida asks,
"of the perpetual restoration of meaning in its virginal state \[within
the egological history\]?" (MP 197, SP 118) Husserl does not stop to
consider the question. He simply "betrays a certain uneasiness ... and
attributes the indecisiveness[]{#calibre_link-1578} of his description
to the incidentally metaphorical character of language." (MP 198, SP
119) Again it is Derrida who, through a careful consideration of
precisely the metaphorics of Husserl's argument, must deliver the
conclusion: "We must conclude that sense in general, the noematic
\[knowable\] sense of every experience, is something which, by its very
nature, must be already able to[]{#calibre_link-1579} *be impressed* on
a meaning, to leave or receive its formal determination in a meaning.
Sense would therefore already be a kind of blank and mute writing which
is reduplicated in meaning." (MP 197, SP 117)

One of Husserl's most original insights is that speech can be genuine
without "knowledge," that the relation with the object that "animates
the body of the signifier" need not be "known" by
the[]{#calibre_link-1580} speaker or hearer through direct intuition.
Derrida, "following the logic and necessity of these \[Husserl's\]
distinctions" (VP 102, SP 92), disengages a more radical suggestion:

. ... not only \[does\] meaning . ... not essentially imply the
intuition of the object but ... it essentially excludes it. ... My
nonperception, my nonintuition, my *hic et nunc* absence are said by
that very thing that I say, by *[]{#calibre_link-1581}that* which I say
and *because* I say it. ... The absence of intuition---and therefore of
the subject of the intuition---is not only *tolerated* by speech; it is
*required* by the general structure of signification, when considered
*in itself*. It is radically []{#calibre_link-1095}requisite: the total
absence of the subject and object of a statement---the death of the
writer and/or the disappearance of the object he was able to
describe---does[]{#calibre_link-1582} not prevent a text from "meaning"
something. On the contrary, this possibility gives birth to meaning as
such, gives it out to be heard and read. (*VP 102*, 108; *SP* 92--93)

The structure of alterity (otherness and absence of meaning or self)
must be operative within the sign for it to operate *as such*. But
Husserl cannot fully articulate this trace-structure of expression,
which his text suggests:[]{#calibre_link-1583} "The theme of full
'presence,' the intuitionistic imperative \[expression must be fulfilled
through intuition\], and the project of knowledge continue to
command---at a distance, we said---the whole of the description. Husserl
describes, and in one and the same movement effaces, the emancipation of
speech as nonknowing." (VP 109, SP 97)

The intuitionistic imperative works curiously in the case of
the[]{#calibre_link-1584} word "I." Husserl will not grant it the
possibility of being uttered without being known intuitively.

*Husserl's premises should sanction our saying exactly the contrary*.
Just as I need not perceive in order to understand a statement about
perception, so there is no need to intuit the object *I* in order to
understand the word I. ... Whether or not perception accompanies the
statement of perception,[]{#calibre_link-1585} whether or not life as
self-presence accompanies the uttering of the *I*, is quite indifferent
with regard to the functioning of meaning. My death is structurally
necessary to the pronouncing of the I. ... The anonymity of the written
*I*, the impropricty \[lack of property\] of *I write, is*, contrary to
what Husserl says, the "normal situation." (*VP* 107--08, *SP* 96--97)

Thus Derrida "produces" an ostensibly[]{#calibre_link-1586} most
anti-Husserlian reading of Husserl: for Husserl, as we have seen, the
voice---not empirical speech but the phenomenological structure of the
voice---is the most immediate evidence of self-presence. In that silent
interior monologue, where no alien material signifier need be
introduced, pure self-communication (auto-affection) is possible.
Derrida shows that, if Husserlian theory is
followed[]{#calibre_link-1587} rigorously, a procedure Husserl himself
seems unwilling to undertake, the structure of speech or voice is seen
to be constituted by the necessary absence of both the object and the
subject. It is constituted, in other words, by the structure of writing:
"The autonomy of meaning with regard to intuitive cognition ... \[that\]
Husserl established ... has its norm in writing." (VP 108, *SP* 96--97)
(Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1588} will argue, on p. 60 passim (40) of the
*Grammatology*, that Saussure too is unable to accept non-intuition as a
norm, but must see it as "crisis.")

Such is Derrida's intimate play with Husserl's text: always to produce
the counter-reading out of the latter's protective hedging. Perhaps all
texts are at least double, containing within themselves the seeds of
their own destruction. []{#calibre_link-878}In
Husserl's[]{#calibre_link-1589} case, the doubleness shows itself in an
extraordinary transparency. "An underlying motif ... disturb\[s\] and
contest\[s\] the security of ... \[the\] traditional distinctions \[made
in Husserl's text\] *from within." (VP* 92, *SP* 82; italics mine)
(Although he had not made a theme of ... the work of difference in the
constitution of sense and signs, he *at bottom* recognized its
necessity." (*VP* 114, *SP* 101; italics[]{#calibre_link-1590} mine) No
doubt the effort at helping Husserl's discourse dehisce sharpened
Derrida's thoughts of grammatology. But the relationship between the two
is interminably interpretive and has no place in a preface. *Speech and
Phenomena*, Derrida's study of Husserl, is thus a philosophical
companion-text to the study of Rousseau in [Part
II](#calibre_link-101){.nounder} of the *Grammatology*.)

Hegel's shadow upon Derrida is diffuse and[]{#calibre_link-1591}
gigantic. We shall lose sight of the provisional outlines of the book
*Grammatology* if we pursue indefinitely the remoter ancestors of the
common noun "grammatology." Derrida's discussion of Hegel, "the first
philosopher of writing," in the *Grammatology* and "Le puits et la
pyramide: introduction à la sémiologie de Hegel" (MP 79--127). is
explicit and clear. It prepares us for the joyous and
magnificent[]{#calibre_link-1592} unstitching of some Hegelian texts in
*Glas*. It is an intimate intertextuality to which I direct your
attention, and there make an end. I shall speak of Hegel a little toward
the end of this Preface.

Let it finally be said that, within this framework, counting the proper
names of predecessors must be recognized as a convenient fiction. Each
proper name establishes a sovereign self against
the[]{#calibre_link-1593} anonymity of textuality. Each proper name
pretends that it is the origin and end of a certain collocation of
thoughts that may be unified: "The names of authors or of doctrines have
here no substantial value. They indicate neither identities nor causes.
It would be frivolous to think that 'Descartes,' 'Leibniz,' 'Rousseau,'
etc. are names of authors, of the authors of movements or displacements
that[]{#calibre_link-1594} we thus designate. The indicative value that
I attribute to them is first the name of a problem" (147--48, 99).
Proper names are no more than serviceable "metonymic contractions."

### ***III*** {#iii .h2}

"Structuralism" is the name of the problematics that we recognize most
readily on the European scene of the sixties. What is Derrida's
relationship to structuralism?

Definitions of movements of thought are always[]{#calibre_link-1595}
contingent and provisional. Here for the sake of exposition I shall use
a shorthand definition: []{#calibre_link-827}structuralism is an attempt
to isolate the general structures of human activity. Thus the
structuralism I speak of is largely the study of literature,
linguistics, anthropology, history, socio-ecnomics, psychology. A
structure is a unit composed of a few elements that are invariably found
in the same[]{#calibre_link-1596} relationship within the "activity"
being described. The unit cannot be broken down into its single
elements, for the unity of the structure is defined not so much by the
substantive nature of the elements as by their relationship. When
Aristotle described tragedy as "the imitation of an action that is
serious and also, as having magnitude, complete in itself ... with
incidents arousing pity and fear,[]{#calibre_link-1597} wherewith to
accomplish its catharsis of such emotions," he was describing the active
structure of tragedy. We know Freud's psychic "description" in terms of
the narcissistic and oedipal structures. In Roland Barthes's words: "...
to find in it \[the object\] certain mobile fragments whose differential
situation engenders a certain meaning; the fragment has no meaning in
itself, but it is nonetheless[]{#calibre_link-1598} such that the
slightest variation wrought in its configuration produces a change in
the whole."^[]{#calibre_link-521}[55](#calibre_link-112){.nounder}^
Derrida, like Nietzsche, would find it merely symptomatic of the human
desire for control to isolate such "units" in an "object" in any but the
most provisional way: ". ... a structural study of the historical
ensemble---notions, institutions. ... How are these elements in 'the
historical ensemble' organized?[]{#calibre_link-1599} What is a
'notion'? Do philosophical notions have a privilege? How do they relate
to scientific concepts?" (*ED* 70)

The study of human activity in terms of the structure of the sign we
might call semiotic or semiological structuralism. Can
Derrida---substituting the structure of writing (the sign "sous rature")
for the structure of the sign---simply be dubbed a grammatological
structuralist historian[]{#calibre_link-1600} of philosophy, and there
an end? No doubt. But to grasp the implications of that formulaic
description, we might launch, not only a shorthand definition, but a
thumbnail "historical outline," that would be useful for the exigencies
of the present discussion. It must of course be remembered that any such
outline would have to be rigorously undone if "the direct object" of
study were the movement[]{#calibre_link-1601} "itself."

In the broad sense, structuralist descriptions have always been with us;
it is customary to cite Aristotle and Plato. In the narrow sense,
however, it is customary to locate the beginnings of modern
structuralism in the following proper names: the Russian Formalists in
literary criticism, Marcel Mauss in anthropology, Ferdinand de Saussure
and N. S. Troubetzkoy in linguistics. The
Formalists,[]{#calibre_link-1602} reacting against what seemed like the
fluid, rhapsodic style of Symbolist criticism (deconstructed, Symbolist
criticism establishes its own variety of rigor), engaged in the
isolation of objective categories descriptive of the "literariness" of
the literary
text.^[]{#calibre_link-522}[56](#calibre_link-113){.nounder}^ Out of
this enthusiasm came such significant texts as Vladimir Propp's
codification of []{#calibre_link-974}motif/structures in folk
tales,^[]{#calibre_link-523}[57](#calibre_link-114){.nounder}^
motif/structures[]{#calibre_link-1603} that can be seen to inhabit the
most sophisticated narratives. East European Structuralism has been
developing the Formalists' investigative methods over the last few
decades, but Derrida is most concerned with structuralism as it came to
live in France.

For the study of the "laws" of the variations in the configuration of
structures, the working analogies came from the study of linguistic
structures.[]{#calibre_link-1604} Troubetzkoy, studying the
configuration of phonemes in the production of meaning, gave one
analogy. Ferdinand de Saussure, describing the structure of the sign
itself---"I mean by sign the whole that results from the associating of
the signifier with the
signified"^[]{#calibre_link-524}[58](#calibre_link-115){.nounder}^---gave
another. Structuralist activity found its analogies in linguistics and
semiotics. Claude Lévi-Strauss provides some
acknowledgements.[]{#calibre_link-1605} Abundantly to Marcel Mauss in
his Introduction to *Sociologie et anthropologie: ". ...* inspiring
ourselves by Mauss's precept that all social phenomena may be
assimilated into language, we see ... \[in them\] the conscious
expression of a semantic
formation."^[]{#calibre_link-525}[59](#calibre_link-116){.nounder}^ Here
to Troubetzkoy (for Derrida's own discussion of this passage we should
turn to pages 151 f. \[102 f.\] of *Of Grammatology):*

Structural linguistics[]{#calibre_link-1606} will certainly play the
same renovating role with respect to the social sciences that nuclear
physics, for example, has played for the physical sciences. In what does
this revolution consist ... ? N. Troubetzkoy, the illustrious founder of
structural linguistics, ... reduced the structural method to four basic
operations. First, structural linguistics shifts from the study of
*conscious* linguistic[]{#calibre_link-1607} phenomena to study of their
*unconscious* infrastructure; second, it does not treat *terms* as
independent entities, taking instead as its basis of analysis the
*relations* between terms; third, it introduces the concept of
*system*---"... it shows concrete phonemic systems and elucidates their
structure"---; finally, structuralist linguistics aims at discovering
*general laws*.... In the study of kinship
problems[]{#calibre_link-1608} (and, no doubt, the study of other
problems as well), the anthropologist finds himself in a situation which
formally resembles that of the structural linguist. Like phonemes,
kinship terms are elements of meaning; like phonemes, they acquire
meaning only if they are integrated into systems. "Kinship systems,"
like "phonemic systems," are built by the mind on the level of
unconscious thought. Finally,[]{#calibre_link-1609} the recurrence of
kinship patterns ... in scattered regions of the globe and in
fundamentally different societies, leads us to believe that, in the case
of kinship as well as linguistics, the observable phenomena result from
the action of laws which are general but
implicit.^[]{#calibre_link-526}[60](#calibre_link-117){.nounder}^

Roman Jakobson, a member of the Prague School of Formalism, encountered
Claude Lévi-Strauss in the United States in the[]{#calibre_link-1610}
1950s. One account of the rise of "structuralism" is that what is
recognized today as the mainstream structuralist method of the
interpretation of texts arose out of this temporary
conjunction.^[]{#calibre_link-527}[61](#calibre_link-118){.nounder}^

I indulge in this sort of sweeping historical fiction because, as I have
suggested, []{#calibre_link-983}Derrida's criticism of "structuralism,"
even as he inhabits it, would be a sweeping one. It would relate to the
possibility[]{#calibre_link-1611} of a general law. The law of
differance is that any law is constituted by postponement and
self-difference. The possibility of a general law is threatened on so
general a level.

Derrida would also problematize the possibility of objective
description. A structuralist statement of structuralist objectives bases
itself on the distinction between subject and object. Structuralist
conclusions are[]{#calibre_link-1612} the object illuminated by the
subject: "The goal of all structuralist activity, whether reflexive or
poetic, is to reconstruct (*reconstituer*) an 'object' in such a way as
to manifest thereby the rules of its functioning (the 'functions') of
this object. Structure is therefore actually a *simulacrum* of the
object, but a directed *interested* simulacrum, since the imitated
object makes something appear[]{#calibre_link-1613} which remained
invisible or, ... unintelligible in the natural
object."^[]{#calibre_link-528}[62](#calibre_link-119){.nounder}^ For
Derrida, however, a text, as we recall, whether "literary," "psychic,"
"anthropological," or otherwise, is a play of presence and absence, a
place of the effaced trace. ("If it is to be radically conceived, \[the
play\] must be thought of before the alternative of presence and
absence" \[*ED* 426, SC 264\].) And textuality is[]{#calibre_link-1614}
not only true of the "object" of study but also true of the "subject"
that studies. It effaces the neat distinction between subject and
object. The grammatological structure as a tool of description is that
structure which forever eludes answering the question "what is ...
?"---the basis of objective description. Even as it remains legible as a
structure, it erases the aim of structuralism---to
provide[]{#calibre_link-1615} objective descriptions.

Speaking generally again, it may be said that the method of
structuralism takes into account that its *objects of study* cannot have
had simple origins in the sovereign subject of an "author." But the
power of the *investigating subject*, which brings intelligibility to
the natural object by imitating it as a structure, in spite of the many
delicate argumentations around it,[]{#calibre_link-1616} cannot
ultimately be denied within the framework of structural study. A
structure, it must be repeated, is the natural object plus the
subjective intelligence of the structuralist: "the simulacrum is
intellect added to object, and this addition has an anthropological
value, in that it is man himself, his history, his situation, his
freedom, and the very resistance which nature offers to his
mind."^[]{#calibre_link-529}[63](#calibre_link-120){.nounder}^

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1617}
:::

The notion of "communication" (a "function" of human structures),
important to structuralism as a tool of investigation, also carries with
it the notion of unified subjects, of meaning as portable property: ".
... *communication*, which, in fact, implies the *transmission charged
with passing, from one subject to the other, the identity* of a
*signified* object of a *meaning* or a *concept* in principle
separable[]{#calibre_link-1618} from the process of passage and of the
signifying operation." (*Pos* F 34).

[]{#calibre_link-817}Derrida finds the concept of the binary sign
itself, in its role as the guide of this objective enterprise, committed
to a science of presence. Barthes writes eloquently: "The sign is not
only the object of a particular knowledge, but also the object of a
*vision*, analogous to the vision of the celestial spheres in
Cicero's[]{#calibre_link-1619} *Somnium Scipionis* or related to the
molecular representations used by chemists; the semiologist *sees* the
sign moving in the field of signification, he enumerates its valences,
traces their configuration: the sign is, for him, a sensous
idea."^[]{#calibre_link-530}[64](#calibre_link-121){.nounder}^ And
Derrida, diagnosing the symptoms of this longing for presence, writes:
"... a semiology ... whose ... concepts and fundamental presuppositions
are most precisely[]{#calibre_link-1620} locatable from Plato to
Husserl, passing by way of Aristotle, Rousseau, Hegel, etc." (*Pos* F
33)

Yet since, as I have argued, the structure of the grammè is the sign
under erasure---both *conserving* and effacing the sign, Derrida must
make use of the concept of the sign. His relationship to structuralism
is therefore intimate. In an interview with Julia Kristeva, Derrida
points out that Saussure's[]{#calibre_link-1621} binary concept of the
sign, questioning the separable primacy of meaning---the transcendental
signified---pointed a way out of the metaphysics of presence:

Saussurian semiology noted, against tradition, that the signified was
inseparable from the signifier, that \[they\] are the two faces of one
and the same production. ... By showing that "it is impossible for sound
alone, the material element, to belong[]{#calibre_link-1622} to the
language" and that "\[in its essence the linguistic signifier\] is in no
way phonic" (p.
164)^[]{#calibre_link-531}[65](#calibre_link-122){.nounder}^; by
desubstantializing at once the signified content and the "substance of
expression"---which is therefore no longer exclusively the phonè---. ...
Saussure contributed greatly to turning against the metaphysical
tradition the concept of the sign that he borrowed from it. (*Pos* F 28)

Derrida analyzes[]{#calibre_link-1623} Saussure's *Cours de linguistique
générale* and the linguistics of the first half of the present century
in the chapter of this book entitled "Linguistics and Grammatology," and
the argument about Saussure is best presented there. We might simply say
that Saussure was not a grammatologist because, having launched the
binary sign, he did not proceed to put it under erasure. The binary
opposition[]{#calibre_link-1624} within the Saussurian sign is in a
sense paradigmatic of the structure of structuralist methodology. "We
must doubtless resort to pairings like those of *signifier/signified*
and *synchronic/diachronic* in order to approach what distinguishes
structuralism from other modes of
thought."^[]{#calibre_link-532}[66](#calibre_link-123){.nounder}^

In the passage where Lévi-Strauss acknowledges his debt to Troubetzkoy,
for example, we notice the reference to[]{#calibre_link-1625} a study of
the *unconscious* infrastructure. In Derrida, via Freud, there would be
a difficulty in setting up the opposition between the conscious and the
unconscious within the subject []{#calibre_link-1010}as the founding
principle of a systematic study. The unconscious is undecidable, either
the always already other, out of reach of psychic descriptions, or else
it is thoroughly and constitutively implicated in
so-called[]{#calibre_link-1626} conscious activity. Further, as I have
pointed out, the opposition of the subject and the object, upon which
the possibility of objective descriptions rests, is also questioned by
the grammatological approach. The description of the object is as
contaminated by the patterns of the subject's desire as is the subject
constituted by that never-fulfilled desire. We can go yet further and
repeat[]{#calibre_link-1627} that the structure of binary oppositions in
general is questioned by grammatology. Differance invites us to undo the
need for balanced equations, to see if each term in an opposition is not
after all an accomplice of the other: "At the point where the concept of
differance intervenes ... all the conceptual oppositions of metaphysics,
to the extent that they have for ultimate reference the
presence[]{#calibre_link-1628} of a present, ... (signifier/signified;
sensible/intelligible; writing/speech; speech
[]{#calibre_link-1629}[]{#calibre_link-1630}*\[parole\]*/language
*\[langue\];* diachrony/synchrony; space/time; passivity/activity etc.)
become non-pertinent." (*Pos* 41)

It is therefore not too extravagant to say that "writing" or
"differance" is the structure that would deconstruct structuralism---as
indeed it would deconstruct all texts, being, as we shall see, the
always already differentiated structure of deconstruction.

It should by now be[]{#calibre_link-1631} clear where the structuralists
have stopped short, or what they did not begin with. They have not
thought the "sous
rature."^[]{#calibre_link-533}[67](#calibre_link-124){.nounder}^ It is
as if they have grasped only Nietzsche's "knowledge," showing us the
interpretive power working through human society, so that all its
studies become "genealogical," an unending decipherment of sign-chains.
How close to that aspect of Nietzsche this passage
from[]{#calibre_link-1632} Roland Barthes sounds!: "... structural man
... too listens for the natural in culture, and constantly perceives in
it not so much stable, finite, 'true' meanings as the shudder of an
enormous machine which is humanity tirelessly undertaking to create
meaning, without which it would no longer be
human."^[]{#calibre_link-534}[68](#calibre_link-125){.nounder}^ But it
is also as if the gravest lesson of that knowledge, its need for
abdication, has not been[]{#calibre_link-1633} imagined by the
structuralists. Nongrammatological structuralism cannot afford to
cultivate the will to ignorance: *"Homo significans:* such would be the
new man of structural
inquiry."^[]{#calibre_link-535}[69](#calibre_link-126){.nounder}^

The solution is not merely to say "I shall not objectify." It is rather
to recognize at once that there is no other language but that of
"objectification" and that any distinction between "subjectification"
and[]{#calibre_link-1634} "objectification" is as provisional as the use
of any set of hierarchized oppositions. Derrida sets this forth most
energetically in two early essays where he deals with two structuralist
critics who take elaborate precautions against objectification. I have
already referred to one---"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Sciences of
Man"---where Derrida interprets Lévi-Strauss's attempt
[]{#calibre_link-879}at a mythomorphic[]{#calibre_link-1635} criticism
of myth. The other is "Cogito et l'histoire de la folie"---a critique of
Michel Foucault's *Histoire de la folie à l'âge
classique*.^[]{#calibre_link-536}[70](#calibre_link-127){.nounder}^

Foucault writes, writes Derrida, as if he *"knew* what madness meant"
(*ED* 66). Foucault speaks thus for Reason, madness's other---if his own
binary opposition is to be trusted. Yet he wishes to speak for "madness
*itself"* (ED 56), write "the archaeology of
\[its\][]{#calibre_link-1636}
silence."^[]{#calibre_link-537}[71](#calibre_link-128){.nounder}^ But
how can this be more than merely rhetorical? For an archaeolgy is
perpetrated through discourse, imposing reason's syntax upon folly's
silence. Indeed Foucault recognizes the problem and on occasion
articulates it.

But, "to say the difficulty, to say the difficulty of saying, is not yet
to surmount it" (*ED* 61). Foucault sidesteps precisely this issue, says
Derrida, by misreading[]{#calibre_link-1637} Descartes.

Foucault sees in Descartes one of the exemplary separators of reason and
madness. Derrida's reading of Descartes on folly is an elegant bit of
deconstruction; he spots the moment of the forgetting of the trace in
Descartes' text. Descartes, he argues, gives the name "folly" to the
*pre-*reflexive cogito---*before* the "I think" can be reflected upon
and pronounced. In the prereflexive cogito[]{#calibre_link-1638} "folly"
and "I think" are interchangeable, intersubstitutable. There the
distinction between reason and folly does not appear. There the "cogito"
cannot be communicated, made to appear to another self like my own. But
when Descartes begins to speak and reflect upon the cogito, he gives it
a temporal dimension, and distinguishes it from madness. The
relationship between the prereflexive cogito[]{#calibre_link-1639}
(which is also madness) and the temporal cogito (which is distinct from
madness) is thus analogous to that between the precomprehended question
of Being and the propositional concept of Being. The possibility of
discourse is lodged in the interminably repeated movement from the one
to the other---from "excess" to a "closed structure." (*ED* 94)
Foucault, not recognizing this, still remains
confined[]{#calibre_link-1640} within the structuralist science of
investigation through oppositions.

This is a dated Foucault, the Foucault of the sixties. Even then he was
violently unwilling to be called a structuralist, and he gets into this
section of my preface because he diagnoses an age in terms of its
*epistémè*, the self-defined structure of its knowing. This particular
characteristic of Foucault's work has not
disappeared.[]{#calibre_link-1641} To diagnose the epistemic structure,
he has had, with repeated protestations to the contrary, to step out of
epistemic structures in general, assuming that were possible. To write
his "archaeologies," he has had to analyze metaphors privileged by a
particular age in what Derrida would call "meta-metaphorics." By
describing grammatology as "a history of the possibility of history that
would[]{#calibre_link-1642} no longer be an archaeology," (43, 28),
Derrida seems to declare an advance over Foucault. And by denying the
status of a positive science to grammatology, he "erases" the advance.
[]{#calibre_link-1643}Perhaps there is an attempt to rewrite the
Foucauldian method in "The White Mythology," Derrida's extended essay on
metaphor:

Might we not dream ... of some meta-philosophy, of a more general
discourse which would still[]{#calibre_link-1644} be of a philosophical
kind, on metaphors of the "primary degree," on those non-true metaphors
which set philosophy ajar *\[entrouvert la philosophie\]?* There would
be some interest in work under the heading of a meta-metaphorics such as
this. ... First of all we shall direct interest upon a certain *usure*
\[both attrition through wear and tear and supplementation through
usury\] of metaphorical force[]{#calibre_link-1645} in philosophical
intercourse. It will become clear that this usure is not a supervenient
factor modifying a kind of trope-decay which is *other-wise destined to
remain intact;* on the contrary, it constitutes the very history and
structure of philosophical metaphor. (*MP* 308, 249; "White Mythology"
61, 6; italics mine)

(It should be mentioned here that, at the end of the second edition of
*Histoire[]{#calibre_link-1646} de la folie*, which appeared eleven
years after the first, Foucault includes a twenty-page rebuttal of
Derrida's critique, entitled "Mon corps, ce papier, ce feu." Foucault's
analysis of Derrida's misreading \[as he thinks\] of Descartes is
thorough and often convincing, and should be examined carefully. For our
purposes here, it suffices to note that Foucault does not address
himself to the precomprehended[]{#calibre_link-1647} cogito. His point
is rather to prove that Descartes does indeed exclude madness as he does
not exclude the dream. He takes Derrida's reading to be "a
generalization of doubt," a taking away of the Cartesian certitude from
Descartes. This reading is, of course, not altogether false, but it
leaves untouched the configuration of Derrida's more interesting
suggestion that the Cartesian certitude[]{#calibre_link-1648} is
grounded on a category that may just as easily be described as either
certitude or doubt, neither certitude nor doubt. In fact when, speaking
against Derrida, Foucault shows us that Descartes *disqualifies*
\[rather than excludes\] madness from giving evidence, as an "excessive
and impossible proof" \[p. 596\], we may suggest that Foucault's reading
in this case is not very different from Derrida's.)

But the most interesting thing about Foucault's rebuttal is the
virulence at the end. I shall make no attempt to defend Derrida here,
but will extract a passage from Foucault to give you a taste of the
hostility toward the threat of the "sous rature"---a concept that
Foucault, in these lines, does not seem to have carefully
attended---that is not necessarily confined to Michel Foucault:

Today Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1650} is the most decisive representative
of a \[classical\] system in its final glory; the reduction of
discursive practice to textual traces; the elision of the events that
are produced there in order to retain nothing but marks for a reading;
the invention of voices behind texts in order not to have to analyse the
modes of implication of the subject in discourse; assigning the spoken
and the unspoken[]{#calibre_link-1651} in the text to an originary place
in order not to have to reinstate []{#calibre_link-984}the discursive
practises in the field of transformations where they are effectuated.
... It is an historically sufficiently determined little pedagogy which
manifests itself most visibly. A pedagogy that tells the pupil that
there is nothing outside of the text, but that within it, in its
interstices, in its white spaces and
unspokennesses,[]{#calibre_link-1652} the reserve of the origin reigns;
it is not at all necessary to search elsewhere, for exactly here, to be
sure not in the words, but in words as erasures, in their *grill*, "the
meaning of being" speaks itself. A pedagogy that conversely gives to the
voice of the teacher that unlimited sovereignty which permits them to
read the text indefinitely \[p. 602\].

Derrida defends psychoanalysis against[]{#calibre_link-1653} Foucault,
who calls it "a monologue of reason *about*
madness."^[]{#calibre_link-538}[72](#calibre_link-129){.nounder}^ "It is
not by chance that it is only today that such a project \[as
Foucault's\] could be formed. ... It must be supposed that ... a certain
liberation of madness has begun, that psychiatry, in however small a
way, is open, that the concept of madness as unreason, if it ever had a
unity, has been dislocated." (*ED* 61)

Jacques Lacan, the[]{#calibre_link-1654} great contemporary interpreter
of Freud, is an instigator of such a dislocation. Not only has he
underwritten Freud's own denial of a difference in kind between the
"normal" and the "abnormal" psyche, but he has also rejected the dogma,
launched according to him by American ego
psychologists,^[]{#calibre_link-539}[73](#calibre_link-130){.nounder}^
that the ego is the primary determinant of the psyche. He works, rather,
with a "subject" which can[]{#calibre_link-1655} never be a "total
personality," the "exercise of whose function" is to be forever divided
from the object of its desire (Lacan computes the structural
relationships among need, demand for love, and desire), and to
constitute itself in the distortive play of metaphor and
metonymy---displacement and condensation---that forever distances the
other, the object of its desire, from itself. (*Ec* 692)
Freud[]{#calibre_link-1656} had not allowed verbality to lodge deeper
than the Preconscious, thus protecting the metaphysical alterity of the
Unconscious. Lacan extends Freud in a direction that Derrida would
endorse. He defines the unconscious in terms of the structure of a
language: "It is not only man who speaks, but... in man and by man it
\[id\] speaks, ... his nature becomes woven by the effects where the
structure of language,[]{#calibre_link-1657} whose material he becomes,
is recovered." (*Ec* 688--89)

Derrida is aware of the affinity between Lacan's thought and his own:
"In France, the 'literary criticism' marked by psychoanalysis had not
asked the question of the text. ... Although Lacan is not directly and
systematically interested in the so-called 'literary' text, ... the
*general* question of the text is incessantly at work \[in his
discourse\]."[]{#calibre_link-1658} (*FV* 100--01)

Yet in spite of, perhaps because of, this proximity, the relationship
between these two men is charged with unease. Dissociating himself from
the "perversions" spawned by his own work between 1953 and 1967, Lacan
[]{#calibre_link-944}finds it necessary to interject: "... my discourse
... is a different kind of buoy in this rising tide of the signifier, of
the signified, of the 'it speaks,' of trace, of
*grammè*[]{#calibre_link-1659}, of lure, of myth, from the circulation
of which I have now withdrawn. Aphrodite of this foam, there has arisen
from it latterly *differance*, with an
*a."^[]{#calibre_link-540}[74](#calibre_link-131){.nounder}^* Derrida,
in an uncharacteristically positivistic gesture, has settled the
question of Lacan's influence upon himself in a long footnote to an
interview. (*Pos* F 117 f., *Pos* E II. 43--44) But let us admit that,
on occasion, Derrida will not allow[]{#calibre_link-1660} Lacan the same
playfulness with terms that he allows
himself.^[]{#calibre_link-541}[75](#calibre_link-132){.nounder}^

The relationship between Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida has no
apparent bearing upon the subject matter of the *Grammatology*. But the
controlled and limited polemic between them does illuminate two issues
important for an understanding of the *Grammatology* within the general
framework of Derrida's thought: the place of "truth"
in[]{#calibre_link-1661} discourse and the place of the signifier in
general.

First, then, a consideration of the place of "truth" in Lacanian
discourse as Derrida interprets it.

The goal of Lacanian analysis is to draw out and establish the "truth"
of the subject. It is not a simple question of objectification of a
subjective situation. For "no language can speak the truth about truth,
for the grounds of truth are[]{#calibre_link-1662} that which it speaks,
it cannot found itself in any other way." (*Ec* 867--68) "Language
installs the dimension of truth (inconceivable outside of discourse or
what is structured as discourse), even as it excludes all guarantee of
this truth." Yet, just as, even while establishing the notion of "sous
rature," Heidegger could not relinquish a nostalgia for undoing
forgetfulness, so Lacan's thought[]{#calibre_link-1663} must work in
terms of a reference point that is the *primary truth*. The passage
above continues: "In relation to this absence of guarantee, a primary
affirmation is engendered that is also the *primary truth." (Sc* I. 98)
As in Heidegger the answer to the precomprehended question of Being
might be read as a self-sufficient signified of all signifiers, so
Lacan's ineffable primary truth becomes its[]{#calibre_link-1664} own
guarantee. Derrida makes the Heideggerian connections explicit:

Truth---cut off from \[or adulterated with, *coupée de\]* knowledge---is
constantly determined as revelation, non-veiling, that is: necessarily
as presence, presentation of the present, "Being of being"
(*Anwesenheit*) or, in a more literally Heideggerian mode, as the unity
of veiling and unveiling. The reference to the *results* of
Heidegger's[]{#calibre_link-1665} progress is often explicit in this
form ("the radical ambiguity indicated by Heidegger to the extent that
truth means revelation," \[*Ec*\] p. 166, "the passion for unveiling
which has an object: the truth." \[*Ec*\] p. 193, etc.) (*Pos* F 117,
*Pos* E II. 43)

Freud had given "a metaphysical name" to the radical alterity inhabiting
the psyche---the unconscious. It appears to Derrida that, in spite of
giving []{#calibre_link-1030}[]{#calibre_link-1666}to the unconscious
the structure of a language, Lacan has contrived to entrench Freud's
metaphysical suggestions by making the unconscious the seat of
verification and "truth." Lacan speaks often and at length about the
"veritable subject of the unconscious" (*Ec* 417) and of "the truth" of
the unconscious as the "cause" of the signifying symptomatology of the
subject. The analyst interprets the[]{#calibre_link-1667} distorted
*énonciation* (speech event) of the subject's symptom into the true
*énoncé* (narrated event) of the unconscious: "... to the extent that it
*\[the subject\]* speaks, it is in the place of the Other that it begins
to constitute that truthful lie *\[mensonge veridique\]* by way of which
what partakes of desire on the level of the unconscious gets itself
going."^[]{#calibre_link-542}[76](#calibre_link-133){.nounder}^

"Le mensonge veridique." This, Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1668} feels, is
too clearly Lacan's attitude toward fiction. Whereas Derrida sees
"truth" (if one can risk that word) as being constituted by "fiction"
(if one can risk *that* word), Lacan seems to use fiction as a clue to
truth. There is a fairly detailed discussion of this in Derrida's "Le
facteur de la vérité": "Once one had distinguished, as does the entire
philosophical tradition, between truth and[]{#calibre_link-1669}
reality, it goes without saying that truth 'establishes itself in the
structure of a fiction.' Lacan strongly insists upon the opposition
truth/reality which he advances as a paradox. This opposition, as
orthodox as possible, facilitates the passage of truth through fiction:
common sense will always have made the division between reality and
fiction." (*FV* 128) Here again, Lacan seems to
Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1670} to have carried forward Freud's less
adventurous side---the side that solves puzzles---at the expense of the
Freud who opens up the grammatology of the psyche. Lacan's misreading of
the quotation from Crébillon at the end of Poe's "The Purloined
Letter"---he substitutes "destin" (destiny) for the more problematic
"dessein" (design)---is perhaps paradigmatic of this attitude.

Derrida's second point of[]{#calibre_link-1671} disagreement with Lacan
relates to the "transcendental signifier." In a note on [page
32](#calibre_link-134){.nounder} ([page
324](#calibre_link-135){.nounder}) of the *Grammatology* Derrida
cautions us that, when we teach ourselves to reject the notion of the
primacy of the signified---of meaning over word---we should not satisfy
our longing for transcendence by giving primacy to the signifier---word
over meaning. And, Derrida feels that Lacan might have
perpetrated[]{#calibre_link-1672} precisely this.

The signifiers in Lacan are the symbols that relate the subject through
the structure of desire to the unconscious. "So runs the signifier's
answer \[to the subject\], above and beyond all significations: 'You
think you act when I stir you at the mercy of the bonds through which I
knot your desires. Thus do they grow and multiply in objects, bringing
you back to the fragmentation[]{#calibre_link-1673} of your shattered
childhood." (*Ec* 40, *FF* 71--72) "You will grasp why the relationship
of the subject to the signifier is the reference that we would place in
the foreground of a general rectification []{#calibre_link-1674}of
analytic theory, because it is as primary and constituting in the
setting up of the analytical experience, as it is primary and
constituting in the radical function of the
unconscious."^[]{#calibre_link-543}[77](#calibre_link-136){.nounder}^ It
has[]{#calibre_link-1675} "priority in relation to the signified." (*Ec*
29, *FF* 59) And "the signifier alone guarantees the theoretical
coherence of the entirety *\[ensemble\]* \[of the subject\] as an
entirety." (*Ec* 414) Each signifier in the subject is singular and
indivisible. In this it shares, Derrida suggests, the uniqueness and
unassailable presence traditionally accorded to the "idea." For the
hallmark of a philosophically[]{#calibre_link-1676} intelligible idea is
that it can be infinitely repeated as the "same" idea: it is singular
and indivisible. (FV 121, 126) To repeat our catechism: for Derrida, by
contrast to all this, the signifier and signified are interchangeable;
one is the differance of the other; the concept of the sign itself is no
more than a legible yet effaced, unavoidable tool. Repetition leads to a
simulacrum, not[]{#calibre_link-1677} to the "same."

Lacan's radical description of the function of the signifier combines
presence and absence. "For the signifier is a unit in its very
uniqueness, being by nature *symbol only of an absence." (Ec* 24, FF 29)
It signifies a desire for some thing that the subject has not, the other
of the subject. And the master signifier of these signifiers of desire
is the phallus, reflecting the powerful[]{#calibre_link-1678} human
passions, the fear of castration (of the mother) in the male and the
envy of the penis in the female. This is not the phallus as an actual
organ, penis or clitoris. It is the phallus as a *signifier*, that can
come to take the place of all signifiers signifying all desires for all
absences. "Its most profound relation: that by which the Ancients
incarnated the *Nous* and the *Logos." (Ec* 695)[]{#calibre_link-1679}
"The phallus is a signifier, a signifier whose function ... perhaps
lifts the veil from that which it held in the mysteries. For it is the
signifier destined to design in their entirety the effects of the
signified, to the extent that the signifier conditions them by its
signifier-presence *\[présence de signifiant\]." (Ec* 690) The position
of the phallus "on the chain of signifiers to which it
belongs[]{#calibre_link-1680} even as it makes it possible" (FV 132) is,
strictly speaking, *transcendental*. Heidegger's Being, even under
erasure, could be a transcendental signified. Lacan's phallus,
signifying an absence, is a transcendental signifier.

Within this sexual fable of the production of meaning, Derrida's term is
dissemination. Exploiting a false etymological kinship between semantics
and semen, Derrida offers[]{#calibre_link-1681} this version of
textuality: A sowing that does not produce plants, but is simply
infinitely repeated. A semination that is not insemination but
disseminaton, seed spilled in vain, an emission that cannot return to
its origin in the father. Not an exact and controlled polysemy, but a
proliferation of always different, always postponed meanings. Speaking
of the purloined letter as signifier, Lacan[]{#calibre_link-1682}
writes: "... a letter always arrives at its destination." (*Ec* 41, FF
72) It "always might not" (FV 115) is the mode of Derrida's answer.
Castration, the lack of superintendence []{#calibre_link-904}by phallic
authority, is what transforms the "author" or the "book" into a "text."
Presence can be articulated only if it is *fragmented* into discourse;
"castration" and dismemberment being both a menace to and the
condition[]{#calibre_link-1683} of the possibility of discourse.
Somewhat extravagantly, the phallus may itself be seen as the knife that
severs itself to perpetuate its dissemination. One begins to suspect
that a phallocentric fable of meaning simply will not suffice.

In what it seems satisfying to me to construe as a
![image](images/000003.jpg){.calibre7} gesture, Derrida offers us a
hymeneal fable. The hymen[]{#calibre_link-1684} is the always folded
(therefore never single or simple) space in which the pen writes its
dissemination. "Metaphorically" it means the consummation of marriage.
"Literally" its presence signifies the absence of consummation. This
and/or structure bodies forth the play of presence and absence. The
hymen undoes oppositions because it acts as it suffers. This fabulous
hymen, anagram of *hymme*, "always[]{#calibre_link-1685} intact as it is
always ravished, a screen, a tissue," undoes "the assurance of mastery"
(*Dis* 260). I refer the reader to Derrida's "La double séance," where
the hymen is lavishly (un) folded.

"If we imagine one hand writing upon the surface of the mystic
writing-pad while another periodically raises its covering sheet from
the wax slab, we shall have a concrete representation of the way in
which[]{#calibre_link-1686} I tried to picture the functioning of the
perceptual apparatus of our mind" (*GW* XIV 11, *SE* XIX 234). Derrida's
legend of meaning undoes Freud's phallocentrism through a double-jointed
notion like the Freudian mystic writing-pad sketched above. No longer
castration (the realization of sexual difference as the model for the
difference between signifier and signified) as the origin of
signification.[]{#calibre_link-1687} Rather *involve* that sexual
difference in the "concrete representation" (in the long run these words
must be criticized, of course) of the making of meaning: dissemination
into the hymen. Into the (n)ever-virgin, (n)ever-violated hymen of
interpretation, always supplementing through its fold which is also an
opening, is spilled the seed of meaning; a seed that scatters itself
abroad rather than[]{#calibre_link-1688} inseminates. Or, turning the
terms around, the playfully disseminating rather than proprietorially
hermeneutic gesture of interpretation (n)ever penetrates the hymen of
the text. It is a sexual union forever deferred. In a triumph of
colloquialism, Derrida writes what might be roughly translated as "It
\[dissemination\] comes too soon." But in the French the play is more
pronounced: "Elle---le \[le sens\][]{#calibre_link-1689} laisse d'avance
tomber" (*Dis* 300)---"She lets it \[the meaning\] fall in advance."
Derrida takes advantage of the simple grammatical fact that
dissemination---the male act---being a noun ending in "tion," is
feminine in French. The pronoun "elle" confuses sexual agency. And the
"---" between subject and object-predicate commemorates the deferment
inhabiting the hymeneal dissemination of meaning.

[]{#calibre_link-945}Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1690} would see in Lacan's
idiom of "good and bad faith," of "authenticity," of "truth," the
remnants of a postwar "existentialist" ethic. He would see in Lacan many
unacknowledged debts to the Hegelian and Husserlian phenomenology that
the psychoanalyst ridicules (*Pos* F 117, *Pos* E II. 43). Lacan does
abundantly present himself as the prophet who is energetically unveiling
the "true" Freud. Such a vocation[]{#calibre_link-1691} offends Derrida
the deconstructor, for whom the critic's selfhood is as vulnerable with
textuality as the text itself.

The previous section concerned itself with three magistral
grammatologues: Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger. We
come back to them in another way at the end of this section. For Derrida
the provisionally locatable priming-point of structuralism, the
awareness[]{#calibre_link-1692} of the structurality of things, does not
lie only in the discovery of the "objective" structures of language,
providing "scientific" models for the study of "man." It lies also in
the rigorous reopening of the question of the relationship between
"subjective" and "objective" structures, a structure of desire that puts
the status of the human being and of that very distinction in question:

Where[]{#calibre_link-1693} and how does this decentering, this notion
of the structurality of structure, occur? It would be somewhat naive to
refer to an event, a doctrine, or an author in order to designate this
occurrence. It is no doubt part of the totality of an
era^[]{#calibre_link-544}[78](#calibre_link-137){.nounder}^ . ...
Nevertheless, if I wished to give some sort of indication by choosing
one or two "names," and by recalling those authors in whose discourses
this[]{#calibre_link-1694} occurrence has most nearly maintained its
most radical formulation, I would probably cite the Nietzschean critique
of metaphysics, the critique of the concepts of being and truth, for
which were substituted the concepts of play, interpretation, and sign
(sign without truth present); the Freudian critique of self-presence,
that is, the critique of consciousness, of the subject, of self-identity
and[]{#calibre_link-1695} self-proximity or self-possession; and, more
radically, the Heideggerian destruction of metaphysics, of ontotheology,
of the determination of being as presence. (ED 411--12, *SC* 249--50)

### ***IV*** {#iv .h2}

The launching of the structural method meant an "inflation of the sign
'language'," and thus, as we have seen, an "inflation of the sign
itself." (15, 6) And this, in fact, meant an inflation, not of the
graphic,[]{#calibre_link-1696} but of the phonic sign, of the rôle of
the element of sound in the production of meaning, language as speech.
[Chapter 2](#calibre_link-14){.nounder} of the *Grammatology* describes
how Saussure prescribed linguistics to be a study of speech alone,
rather than speech and writing. The emphasis is shared by Jakobson, by
Lévi-Strauss, []{#calibre_link-985}indeed by all semiological
structuralism. Lacan, dealing ostensibly' with the signifier
alone,[]{#calibre_link-1697} sees it as half of a *"phonematic*
opposition" (*Ec* 414) and calls the subject's language, when it
indicates the charge of the truth of the unconscious---a "full *speech"
\[parole pleine\]*.

In the *Grammatology* Derrida suggests that this rejection of writing as
an appendage, a mere technique, and yet a menace built into speech---in
effect, a scapegoat---is a symptom of a much broader tendency. He
relates[]{#calibre_link-1698} this *phonocentrism* to
*logocentrism*---the belief that the first and last things are the
Logos, the Word, the Divine Mind, the infinite understanding of God, an
infinitely creative subjectivity, and, closer to our time, the
self-presence of full self-consciousness. In the *Grammatology* and
elsewhere, Derrida argues that the evidence for this originary and
teleologic presence has customarily been found[]{#calibre_link-1699} in
the voice, the *phone*. This is most clearly presented in terms of
Husserlian thought in [Chapter 6](#calibre_link-31){.nounder}, "The
Voice that Keeps Silence," of *Speech and Phenomena*. We have seen how,
according to Derrida, Husserl's text is tortured by a suppressed insight
that the Living Present is always already inhabited by difference. What
allows Husserl to operate this suppression is the evidence for
self-presence[]{#calibre_link-1700} that he finds in the voice---not the
"real" voice, but the principle of the voice in our interior soliloquy:
"Why is the phoneme the most 'ideal' of signs? ... When I speak, it
belongs to the phenomenological essence of this operation that *I hear
myself* \[je m'entende: *hear and understand\] at the same time* that I
speak. ... As pure auto-affection, the operation of hearing oneself
speak seems to reduce[]{#calibre_link-1701} even the inward surface of
one's own body. ... This auto-affection is no doubt the possibility for
what is called subjectivity." (VP 86--87, 88, 89; SP 77, 79)

The suggestion is, then, that this phonocentrism-logocentrism relates to
centrism itself---the human desire to posit a "central" presence at
beginning and end:

The notion of the sign ... remains within the heritage of that
logocentrism which[]{#calibre_link-1702} is also a phonocentrism:
absolute proximity of voice and being, of voice and the meaning of
being, of voice and the ideality of meaning... We already have a
foreboding that phonocentrism merges with the historical determination
of the meaning of being in general as *presence*, with all the
sub-determinations which depend on this general form ... (presence of
the thing to the sight as *eidos*, presence[]{#calibre_link-1703} as
substance/essence/existence (*ousia*), temporal presence as point
(*stigm*è) of the now or of the moment (*nun*), the self-presence of the
cogito, consciousness, subjectivity, the co-presence of the other and of
the self, intersubjectivity as the intentional phenomenon of the ego,
and so forth). Logocentrism would thus support the determination of the
being of the entity as presence. (23, 11--12)

[]{#calibre_link-1704}Lacan's phallocentrism, extending, as Derrida sees
it, Freud's metaphysical bondage, fits into this pattern: "Freud, like
his followers, only *described* the []{#calibre_link-1007}necessity of
phallogocentrism. ... It is neither an ancient nor a speculative
mistake. ... It is an enormous and old root." (FV 145)

It is this longing for a center, an authorizing pressure, that spawns
hierarchized oppositions. The superior term[]{#calibre_link-1705}
belongs to presence and the logos; the inferior serves to define its
status and mark a fall. The oppositions between intelligible and
sensible, soul and body seem to have lasted out "the history of Western
philosophy," bequeathing their burden to modern linguistics' opposition
between meaning and word. The opposition between writing and speech
takes its place within this pattern.

In the spirit[]{#calibre_link-1706} of interpretation rather than of
commentary, I have described the structure of writing as the sign under
erasure. It would now be appropriate to recall the opening pages of this
Preface, and call the structure of writing "metaphysics under erasure."
Trace-structure, everything always already inhabited by the track of
something that is not itself, questions presence-structure. If "the
present of[]{#calibre_link-1707} self-presence ... \[seems\] as
indivisible as the blink of an eye" (VP 66, SP 59), we must recognize
that "there is a duration to the blink, and it closes the eye." (VP 73,
SP 65) This presence of the trace and trace of the presence Derrida
names "archiécriture."

You will participate in the slow unfolding of these arguments in the
first part of *Of Grammatology*. I shall not "repeat" them at
length[]{#calibre_link-1708} here. But I shall point out again what I
have pointed at before: the name "writing" is given here to an entire
structure of investigation, not merely to "writing in the narrow sense,"
graphic notation on tangible material. Thus *Of Grammatology* is not a
simple valorization of writing over speech, a simple reversal of the
hierarchy, a sort of anti-McLuhan. The repression of writing in the
narrow[]{#calibre_link-1709} sense is a pervasive symptom of centrism
and that is why much of our book concerns itself precisely with that.
The usual notion of writing in the narrow sense does contain the
elements of the structure of writing in general: the absence of the
"author" and of the "subject-matter," interpretability, the deployment
of a space and a time that is not "its own." We "recognize" all this in
writing in the[]{#calibre_link-1710} narrow sense and "repress" it; this
allows us to ignore that everything else is also inhabited by the
structure of writing in general, that "the thing itself always escapes."
(VP 165, SP 104) Derrida's choice of the words "writing" or
"arche-writing" is thus not fortuitous. Indeed, as Derrida repeatedly
points out in the section on Lévi-Strauss, no rigorous distinction
between writing in the narrow[]{#calibre_link-1711} and the general
senses can be made. One slips into the other, putting the distinction
under erasure. Writing has had the negative privilege of being the
scapegoat whose exclusion represents the definition of the metaphysical
enclosure.

Yet the choice of "writing" is also polemical, against the manifest
phonocentrism of structuralism. And this is precisely what has sometimes
led to []{#calibre_link-1034}that general[]{#calibre_link-1712}
misunderstanding, to the hasty view that Derrida seems to be restoring
priority to writing over speech in the study of language. But this is,
of course, a very hasty view. A careful reading of the *Grammatology*
shows quickly that Derrida points out, rather, that speech too---grafted
within an empirical context, within the structure of speaker-listener,
within the general context of the language,[]{#calibre_link-1713} and
the possibiliy of the absence of the speaker-listener (see page
liii)---is structured as writing, that in this general sense, there is
"writing in speech" (*ED* 294). The first part of the book is entitled
"Writing *Before* the Letter"---writing before the fact of writing in
the narrow sense. The second part, "Nature, Culture, Writing," shows
how, in the texts of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Claude
Lévi-Strauss,[]{#calibre_link-1714} the declared opposition between
Nature and Culture is undone by both the empirical *fact* and the
*structure* of writing.

But if there is no structural distinction between writing and speech,
the choice of "writing" as an operative term is itself suspect, and a
candidate for legible erasure. Derrida puts it this way: "This common
root, which is not a root but the concealment of origin and which
is[]{#calibre_link-1715} not common because it does not come to the same
thing except with the unmonotonous insistence of difference, the
unnamable movement of *difference-itself* which I have strategically
nicknamed *trace, reserve*, or *differance*, can be called writing only
within the *historical* enclosure, that is to say within the boundaries
of metaphysics." (142, 93).

If, in other words, the history of metaphysics
could[]{#calibre_link-1716} have been different, this problematic
"common root" could have been named "speech." But, according to the only
metaphysics and the only language we know or can know, the text of
philosophy (of the so-called "sciences of man," of literature ...) is
always written (we read it in books, on tape, through the psychic
machine); yet that text is always designated by philosophy (and so
forth) to be speech[]{#calibre_link-1717} ("Plato says ...," or at most,
"it is as if Plato said ..."). "Writing" is "immediate(ly) repressed."
What is written is read as speech or the surrogate of speech. "Writing"
is the name of what is never named. Given differance, however, it is a
violence even to name it thus, or name it with a *proper* name. One can
tolerate nothing more than the nicknaming of *bricolage*.

Derrida would not privilege[]{#calibre_link-1718} a signifier into
transcendence. The movement of "difference-itself," precariously saved
by its resident "contradiction," has many nicknames: trace, differance,
reserve, supplement, dissemination, hymen, greffe, pharmakon, parergon,
and so on. They form a chain where each may be substituted for the
other, but not exactly (of course, even two uses of the same word would
not be exactly the same): "no[]{#calibre_link-1719} concept overlaps
with any other" (*Pos* F 109, *Pos* E 41). Each substitution is also a
displacement, and carries a different metaphoric charge, as Derrida
reminds us often. He is particularly careful in the case of
"differance." It is []{#calibre_link-1027}not easy to coin a word
without seeming to privilege it as a term of final reference. The essay
"La différance" therefore spends a lot of energy on reminding us that
*[]{#calibre_link-1720}"Differance* is neither a *word* nor a
*concept,"* that it "is not theological, not even in the most negative
order of negative theology. The latter ... always hastens to remind us
that, if we deny the predicate of existence to God, it is in order to
recognize him as a superior, inconceivable, and ineffable mode of
being." (*MP* 6, SP 134) Yet giving a definite name is a gesture of
control as authorized[]{#calibre_link-1721} by metaphysical practice. At
the end of the essay he must therefore caution: "For us, differance
remains a metaphysical name. ... 'Older' than Being itself, our language
has no name for such a differance. ... Not even the name 'differance,'
which ... continually breaks up in a chain of differant
*\[différantes\]* substitutions." (*MP* 28, SP 158--59) Of "hymen," he
writes: "This word ... is not indispensable.[]{#calibre_link-1722} ...
If one replaced 'hymen' with 'marriage' or 'crime,' 'identity' or
'difference,' etc., the effect would be the same, except for a
condensation or economic accumulation. ..." (ED 149--50)

He practices this caution in an unemphatic way. He does not hold on to a
single conceptual master-word for very long. "Arche-writing," "trace,"
"supplementarity," such important words in the *Grammatology*, do
not[]{#calibre_link-1723} remain consistently important conceptual
master-words in subsequent texts. Derrida's vocabulary is forever on the
move. He does not relinquish a term altogether. He simply reduces it to
the lower case of a common noun, where each context establishes its
provisional definition yet once again.

In the face of a textual energy that sets itself against congealment, I
have already offered approximative[]{#calibre_link-1724} descriptions of
trace, differance, dissemination, hymen. Derrida's own remark to
Jean-Louis Houdebine is not coy: *"Dissemination* ultimately has no
meaning and cannot be channeled into a definition. I will make no
attempt at that here and prefer to refer to the working of the texts."
(*Pos* F 61, *Pos* E 37) Keeping that admonition in mind, let us say
briefly that "Spacing ... 'is' the index of an
irreducible[]{#calibre_link-1725} outside, and at the same time the
index of a *movement*, of a displacement which indicates an irreducible
alterity." (*Pos* F 107--08, *Pos* E II. 40) As such it reflects the
structure of differance, as does a holding in "reserve," and the
*"entame"*---both beginning something and breaking into something, both
origin and trace. The supplement "is" an *"addition* \[that\] comes to
*make up for* a deficiency, ...[]{#calibre_link-1726} to compensate for
a primordial non-self-presence." (VP 97, SP 87) The structure of
supplementarity is set forth in the second half of *Of Grammatology*.
The *pharmakon* is a Greek word that includes among its meanings poison,
medicine, magic potion. It is a word used to describe writing in Plato's
*Phaedrus*. Plato describes Socrates as the *pharmakeus*---poisoner,
medicine man, sorcerer. Yet neither of[]{#calibre_link-1727} writing nor
of Socrates does Plato use the related word *pharmakos*---scapegoat.
Around this lacuna, Derrida recounts the fable of writing (and
[]{#calibre_link-1728}Socrates) as scapegoat and welcomes *pharmakon*
into this chain of substitutions for "écriture." *Greffe* is
grafting-work, both horticultural and other wise (*Dis* 230).
*Parergon*, a latecomer among these nicknames, is both a frame and a
supplementary "addition."

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1729}
:::

Perhaps the definition of these nicknames should escape the form of
mastery represented by the copula "is." In that spirit Derrida writes:

The *pharmakon* is neither the cure nor the poison, neither good nor
evil, neither the inside nor the outside, neither speech nor writing;
the *supplément* is neither a plus nor a minus, neither an outside nor
the complement of an inside, neither an accident
nor[]{#calibre_link-1730} an essence, etc.; the *hymen* is neither
confusion nor distinction, neither identity nor difference, neither
consummation nor virginity, neither the veil nor the unveiling, neither
the inside nor the outside, etc.; the *gramme* is neither a signifier
nor a signified, neither a sign nor a thing, neither a presence nor an
absence, neither a position nor a negation, etc.; l' *espacement*
\[spacing\] is neither[]{#calibre_link-1731} space nor time; the
*entame* is neither the \[marred\] integrity of a beginning or of a
simple cut nor simply the secondary state. Neither/nor is at once *at
once* or rather or *rather. (Pos* F 59, *Pos* E I. 36)

This might seem an attractively truant world of relativism. But the
fearful pleasure of a truant world is the sense of an authority being
defied. That absolute ground of authority Derrida
would[]{#calibre_link-1732} deny. It would be a spurious pleasure for
the literary critic to feel that this is a more literary idiom than the
austere propositional language we habitually associate with philosophy
proper. Textuality inhabits both, and the distinction between them
remains to be deconstructed. Once this is grasped, it may be noted that
the awareness of the need for deconstruction seems more congenial to the
"irresponsible"[]{#calibre_link-1733} discourse of what is
conventionally called literature. "The natural tendency of *theory*---of
what unites philosophy and science in the *epistémè* \[the accepted
description of *how* one knows\]---will push rather toward filling in
the breach than toward forcing the enclosure. It was normal that the
breakthrough was more secure and more penetrating in the areas of
literature and poetry." (139, 92) The method[]{#calibre_link-1734} of
deconstruction has obvious interest for literary criticism.
Problematizing the distinction between philosophy and literature, it
would read "even philosophy" as "literature."

(It is not enough, however, simply to exclaim over the presence of two
seemingly contradictory arguments within a text and declare a text
satisfactorily disunified, and one's critical approach satisfactorily
grammatological.[]{#calibre_link-1735} If conventional criticism took
pleasure in establishing the "unified" meaning of a text, this brand of
criticism would derive a matching sense of mastery in disclosing a lack
of unity. Such a critical method, relying heavily on polysemy, would not
face the radical playfulness of dissemination. And the critical
conclusions themselves, disclosing opposites, would imply their
reconciliation in[]{#calibre_link-1736} the text.)

[]{#calibre_link-824}Speaking of Derrida and Heidegger, I attempted a
brief description of deconstructive procedure: to spot the point where a
text covers, up its grammatological structure. Here let us expand that
description a little.

"The desire for unity and order," I wrote, "compels the author and the
reader to balance the equation that is the text's system." Derrida in
fact relates this balancing[]{#calibre_link-1737} of equations to the
great circular project of all philosophy in the most general
sense.^[]{#calibre_link-545}[79](#calibre_link-138){.nounder}^ Hegel's
concept of the interiorization *\[Erinnerung\]* of philosophy is, in
this reading, one version of a colossal exigency. The related and
powerful dogma in criticism, most recently underwritten by the critics
of the Geneva
School,^[]{#calibre_link-546}[80](#calibre_link-139){.nounder}^ is the
circle of hermeneutics (interpretation rather than exposition):
criticism[]{#calibre_link-1738} as a movement of identification between
the "subjectivity" of the author as implied in the text, and the
"subjectivity" of the critic:

In fact, it is against the incessant reappropriation of this work of the
simulacrum \[as opposed to the identical repetition\] in a Hegelian type
of dialectics ... that I am attempting to channel the critical
enterprise, Hegelian idealism consisting precisely in
*[]{#calibre_link-1739}sublating* the binary oppositions of classical
idealism, of resolving their contradiction in a third term which turns
up to "aufheben," to deny while uplifting, while idealizing, while
sublimating in an anamnestic interiority (*Erinnerung* \[the German word
also for memory\]) while *interning* difference in a presence to itself.
(*Pos* F 59, *Pos* E I. 36)

Hegel articulated the circle as his central theme[]{#calibre_link-1740}
(39--41, 25--26), sublating the balanced binary oppositions of classical
philosophy. But even in a classical philosophical text there seems to be
a moment when the possibility of the indefinite loss of meaning
(dissemination) is pulled back into the circuit of meaningfulness; the
orderly oppositions functioning under the benign supervision of order as
presence, presence as order. Such moments, too,[]{#calibre_link-1741}
operate in the interests of the circular project of philosophy. Derrida
disengages them in such divergent texts as those of Aristotle and
Descartes. When Aristotle declares Zeno's *aporia* (time both is and is
not) and steps over it without deconstructing it (*MP* 57, Eng 73--74),
or when Descartes proves God's existence by means of the natural light
(of reason), which, "as something natural, ... has[]{#calibre_link-1742}
its source in God, in the God whose existence has been put in doubt and
then demonstrated *thanks to it"* (*MP* 319, *WM* 69--70), then Derrida
points at that equation-balancing at work. Speaking of the metaphor of
the house chosen again and again by philosophical practice, Derrida
suggests the pervasiveness of the circular project, and its articulation
in Hegel: ". ... the borrowed dwelling *\[demeure\]
...*[]{#calibre_link-1743} expropriation, being-away-from-home, but
still in a dwelling, away from home but in someone's home, a place of
self-recovery, self-recognition, self-mustering, self-resemblance,
outside of the self in itself \[*hors de soi en soi\]*. This is
philosophical metaphor as a detour in (or in view of) the
reappropriation, []{#calibre_link-1744}the second coming, the
self-presence of the idea in its light. A metaphorical
journey[]{#calibre_link-1745} from the Platonic *eidos* to the Hegelian
Idea." (*MP* 302, WM 55)

"Outside of the self---in itself." Derrida is doing more here than
simply commenting on philosophy's circular project. He is describing one
of the mainstays of this project---the opposition between metaphor and
truthmetaphor as a detour to truth, truth as "outside itself" in the
borrowed dwelling of a metaphor, but also "itself,"
since[]{#calibre_link-1746} the metaphor points at its own truth.

Traditional textual interpretation founds itself on this particular
understanding of metaphor: a detour to truth. Not only individual
metaphors or systems of metaphors, but fiction in general is seen as a
detour to a truth that the critic can deliver through her
interpretation. We do not usually examine the premises of this familiar
situation. If we did,[]{#calibre_link-1747} we would find, of course,
that not only is there no pure language that is free from metaphor---the
metaphor "is therefore involved in the field it would be the purpose of
a general 'metaphorology' to subsume" (*MP* 261, WM 18); we would find
also that the idea that fiction begins in the truth of the author and
ends in the uncovering of that truth by the critic is given the lie by
our critical and[]{#calibre_link-1748} pedagogical practice. Although we
customarily say that the text is autonomous and self-sufficient, there
would be no justification for our activity if we did not feel that the
text *needed* interpretation. The so-called secondary material is not a
simple adjunct to the so-called primary text. The latter inserts itself
within the interstices of the former, filling holes that are always
already there.[]{#calibre_link-1749} Even as it adds itself to the text,
criticism supplies a lack in the text and the gaps in the chain of
criticism anterior to it. The text is not unique (the acknowledged
presence of polysemy already challenges that uniqueness); the critic
creates a substitute. The text belongs to language, not to the sovereign
and generating author. (New Criticism, although it vigorously argued the
self-enclosure[]{#calibre_link-1750} and "organic unity" of the text,
and indulged in practice in the adulation of the author, had a sense of
this last insight in its critique of the "intentional fallacy.")
Derrida, questioning the unity of language itself, and putting metaphor
under erasure, radically opens up textuality.

Curiously enough, deconstructive criticism must take the "metaphoric"
structure of a text very seriously. Since[]{#calibre_link-1751}
metaphors are not reducible to truth, their own structures "as such" are
part of the textuality (or message) of the text.

And, as I have hinted before, deconstruction must also take into account
the lack of sovereignty of the critic himself. Perhaps this "will to
ignorance" is simply a matter of attitude, a realization that one's
choice of "evidence" is provisional, a self-distrust, a
distrust[]{#calibre_link-1752} of one's own power, the control of one's
vocabulary, a shift from the phallocentric to the hymeneal. Even so,
[]{#calibre_link-1753}it is an important enough lesson for the critic,
that self-professed custodian of the public "meaning" of literature. The
tone of the section entitled "The Exorbitant. Question of Method" where
Derrida "justifies" his choice of subject, gives us a glimpse of that
lesson learned. I quote[]{#calibre_link-1754} a few sentences from it:
"We must begin *wherever we are* and the thought of the trace ... has
already taught us that it is impossible to justify a point of departure
absolutely. *Wherever we are;* in a text where we already believe
ourselves to be" (232--33, 162).

But in the long run a critic cannot himself present his own
vulnerability. We come back simply to that question of attitude. And to
the[]{#calibre_link-1755} awareness that both literature *and* its
criticism must open itself to a deconstructive reading, that criticism
does not reveal the "truth" of literature, just as literature reveals no
"truth."

A reading that *produces* rather than *protects*. That description of
deconstruction we have already entertained. Here is another: "... the
task is... to dismantle *\[déconstruire\]* the metaphysical and
rhetorical[]{#calibre_link-1756} structures which are at work in \[the
text\], not in order to reject or discard them, but to reinscribe them
in another way." (*MP* 256, WM 13)

How to dismantle these structures? By using a signifier not as a
transcendental key that will unlock the way to truth but as a
*bricoleur*'s or tinker's tool---a "positive lever" (*Pos* F 109, *Pos*
E II. 41). If in the process of deciphering a text in the
traditional[]{#calibre_link-1757} way we come across a word that seems
to harbor an unresolvable contradiction, and by virtue of being *one*
word is made sometimes to work in one way and sometimes in another and
thus is made to point away from the absence of a unified meaning, we
shall catch at that word. If a metaphor seems to suppress its
implications, we shall catch at that metaphor. We shall follow its
adventures through the[]{#calibre_link-1758} text and see the text
coming undone as a structure of concealment, revealing its
self-transgression, its undecidability. It must be emphasized that I am
not speaking simply of locating a moment of ambiguity or irony
ultimately incorporated into the text's system of unified meaning but
rather a moment that genuinely threatens to collapse that system. (It
should also be repeated that, although in the[]{#calibre_link-1759}
*Grammatology* Derrida fastens upon the *word* \[signifier, metaphor\]
"supplement" and related *words* in Rousseau's text as his lever, once
the critic's glance is allowed to play upon parts of words and the
spacing of a page, the prising-lever of undecidability may become much
more elusive.) At any rate, the relationship between the reinscribed
text and the so-called original text is not that of
patency[]{#calibre_link-1760} and latency, but rather the relationship
between two palimpsests. The "original" text itself is that palimpsest
on so-called "pre"-texts that the critic might or might not be able to
disclose and any original inscription would still only be a trace:
"Reading then resembles those X-ray pictures which discover, under the
epidermis of the last painting, another hidden picture:
[]{#calibre_link-895}of the same painter[]{#calibre_link-1761} or
another painter, no matter, who would himself, for want of materials, or
for a new effect, use the substance of an ancient canvas or conserve the
fragment of a first sketch" (*Dis* 397).

I have suggested that Derrida implicates himself in the Freudian
procedure of attending to the detail of a text. Here let me place,
beside the metaphors of palimpsest and x-ray picture, Freud's own
analogy---"though[]{#calibre_link-1762} I know that in these matters
analogies never carry us very far"---for the distortion of the psychic
text:

\[there are\] various methods ... for making \[an undesirable\] book
innocuous. \[Derrida would transfer the analogy to the "undesirable"
grammatological "threat" inhabiting every text.\] One way would be for
the offending passages to be thickly crossed through so that they were
illegible. In that[]{#calibre_link-1763} case they could not be
transcribed, and the next copyist of the book would produce a text which
was unexceptionable but which had gaps in certain passages, and so might
be unintelligible in them. Another way ... would be ... to proceed to
distort the text. Single words would be left out or replaced by others,
and new sentences interpolated. *Best of all, the whole passage would be
erased and a new[]{#calibre_link-1764} one which said exactly the
opposite put in its place." (GW* XVI. 81--82, SE XXIII. 236; italics are
mine)

(It is characteristic, of course, that Freud, who put the psyche under
erasure, should, at the same time, use a thoroughly "centric" sentiment
to close the passage: "It no longer contained what the author wanted to
say.")

The sense of the horizon of indefinite meaning, with the
provisional[]{#calibre_link-1765} anchor of the text never given up, has
led to a handful of spectacular readings. The two most adventurous are
"La double séance" (a reading of Mallarmé's "Mimique"; *Dis* 199--317)
and "La dissémination" (a reading of Philippe Sollers' *Nombres; Dis*
319--407). Those acts of controlled acrobatics are difficult to match.
Yet the reading of *Phaedrus* in "La pharmacie de Platon" (*Dis*
69--197) and of *The[]{#calibre_link-1766} Essay on the Origin of
Languages* (235--445, 165--316), although less playful, seem equally
impressive.

Speaking of the hymen, Derrida emphasizes the role of the blank spaces
of the page in the play of meaning. Analogically, Derrida himself often
devotes his attention to the text in its margins, so to speak. He
examines the minute particulars of an undecidable moment, nearly
imperceptible displacements,[]{#calibre_link-1767} that might otherwise
escape the reader's eye. Reading Foucault, he concentrates on three
pages out of 673. Reading Rousseau, he chooses a text that is far from
"central." Reading Heidegger, he proceeds to write a note on a note to
*Sein und Zeit*.

His method, as he says to Jean-Louis Houdebine, perhaps a little too
formulaically, is reversal and displacement. It is not enough "simply to
*neutralize*[]{#calibre_link-1768} the binary oppositions of
metaphysics." We must recognize that, within the familiar philosophical
oppositions, there is always "a violent []{#calibre_link-1769}hierarchy.
One of the two terms controls the other (axiologically, logically,
etc.), holds the superior position. To deconstruct the opposition is
first... to overthrow *\[renverser\]* the hierarchy." (*Pos* F 57, *Pos*
E. I. 36) To fight violence with violence. In the
*[]{#calibre_link-1770}Grammatology* this structural phase would be
represented by all those pages where, all apologies to the contrary, the
polemical energy seems clearly engaged in putting writing above speech.
But in the next phase of deconstruction, this reversal must be
displaced, the winning term put under erasure. The critic must make room
for "the irruptive emergence of a new 'concept,' a concept which no
longer[]{#calibre_link-1771} allows itself to be understood in terms of
the previous regime \[system of oppositions\]." In terms of our book,
this would be the aspect that "allows for the dissonant emergence of a
writing inside of speech, thus disorganizing all the received order and
invading the whole sphere of speech" (*Pos* E I. 36).

To locate the promising marginal text, to disclose the undecidable
moment, to pry it loose[]{#calibre_link-1772} with the positive lever of
the signifier; to reverse the resident hierarchy, only to displace it;
to dismantle in order to reconstitute what is always already inscribed.
Deconstruction in a nutshell. But take away the assurance of the text's
authority, the critic's control, and the primacy of meaning, and the
possession of this formula does not guarantee much.

Why should we undo and redo a text[]{#calibre_link-1773} at all? Why not
assume that words and the author "mean what they say?" It is a complex
question. Here let us examine Derrida's most recent meditation upon the
desire of deconstruction.

Derrida acknowledges that the desire of deconstruction may itself become
a desire to reappropriate the text actively through mastery, to show the
text what it "does not know." And as she deconstructs, all
protestations[]{#calibre_link-1774} to the contrary, the critic
necessarily assumes that she at least, and for the time being, means
what she says. Even the declaration of her vulnerability must come,
after all, in the controlling language of demonstration and reference.
In other words, the critic provisionally forgets that her own text is
necessarily self-deconstructed, always already a palimpsest.

The desire of deconstruction[]{#calibre_link-1775} has also the opposite
allure. Deconstruction seems to offer a way out of the closure of
knowledge. By inaugurating the open-ended indefiniteness of
textuality---by thus "placing in the abyss" (*mettre en abîme*), as the
French expression would literally have it---it shows us the lure of the
abyss as freedom. The fall into the abyss of deconstruction inspires us
with as much pleasure as fear. We are[]{#calibre_link-1776} intoxicated
with the prospect of never hitting bottom.

Thus a further deconstruction deconstructs deconstruction, both as the
search for a foundation (the critic behaving as if she means what she
says in her text), and as the pleasure of the bottomless. The tool for
this, as []{#calibre_link-905}indeed for any deconstruction, is our
desire, itself a deconstructive and grammatological structure that
forever differs[]{#calibre_link-1777} from (we only desire what is not
ourselves) and defers (desire is never fulfilled) the text of our
selves. Deconstruction can therefore never be a positive science. For we
are in a bind, in a "double (read abyssal) bind," Derrida's newest
nickname for the schizophrenia of the "sous
rature."^[]{#calibre_link-547}[81](#calibre_link-140){.nounder}^ We
*must* do a thing *and* its opposite, and indeed we desire to do both,
and so on indefinitely. Deconstruction[]{#calibre_link-1778} is a
perpetually self-deconstructing movement that is inhabited by
differance. No text is ever *fully* deconstructing or deconstructed. Yet
the critic provisionally musters the metaphysical resources of criticism
and performs what declares itself to be *one* (unitary) act of
deconstruction. As I point out on pages **lxxxi-lxxxii,** the kinship
with Freud's interminable and terminable analysis,
involving[]{#calibre_link-1779} both subject and analyst, is here not to
be ignored.

Derrida is now ready to suggest that, in a certain sense, it is
impossible "not to deconstruct/be deconstructed." All texts, whether
written in the narrow sense or not, are rehearsing their grammatological
structure, self-deconstructing as they constitute themselves. The single
act of critical deconstruction is as necessary yet pointless,
arrogant[]{#calibre_link-1780} yet humble, as all human gestures. "In
the deconstruction of the arche, one does not make a choice" (91,
**62**).

These, then, are the lineaments of the Derridean double bind,
deconstruction under erasure, the abyss placed in the abyss, active
forgetfulness. (Here it may be pointed out that one of the traditional
charges against writing is that it breeds passive forgetfulness (55, 37
and passim).[]{#calibre_link-1781} In this respect also, deconstruction
reinscribes the value of writing.) On page **xlv** I bring a charge of
"prudence" against Derrida. The new Derrida shows us that this
"prudence" is also the greatest "danger," the will to knowledge as will
to ignorance and vice versa. "The 'knowledge' of the philosopher places
him among the dreamers, for knowledge is a dream. But the philospher
'knowingly' agrees[]{#calibre_link-1782} to dream, to dream of
knowledge, agrees to 'forget' the lesson of philosophy, only so as to
'prove' that lesson. ... It is a vertiginous movement."

As *Glas* will suggest, this philosophical agreement is the
reader/writer's contract (*seing*) with the text. Let me add yet once
again that this terrifying and exhilarating vertigo is not "mystical" or
"theological." The abyss appears when Nietzsche,
Freud,[]{#calibre_link-1783} Heidegger, Derrida lift the lid of the most
familiar and comforting notions about the possibility of knowledge.

### **V** {#v .h2}

*Of Grammatology* is the provisional origin of this Preface. But we have
not kept track of the book's outline. We have considered instead the
importance of erasure in Derrida; provided some ingredients for the
computation []{#calibre_link-946}of the intertextuality between Derrida,
and Nietzsche, Heidegger,[]{#calibre_link-1784} Freud, Husserl; given
some indications of Derrida's view of Structuralism, especially of the
metapsychological practice of Jacques Lacan; commented on the place of
"writing" in Derrida's thought, hinted at the chain of its
substitutions, given the recipe for deconstruction. Now that we begin
the concluding movements of this repetitive preface, let us make *Of
Grammatology* our provisional end.

[]{#calibre_link-1785}Derrida situates *Of Grammatology* among his own
texts thus:

*Of Grammatology* can be taken as a long essay articulated in two parts
... *between* which one can stitch in *L'écriture et la différence*. The
*Grammatology* often refers to it. In that case, the interpretation of
Rousseau \[[Part II](#calibre_link-101){.nounder} of *Of Grammatology\]*
would be the twelfth item of the collection. Conversely, one can insert
*Of Grammatology* in the[]{#calibre_link-1786} middle of *L'écriture et
la différence*. Since six texts of the latter are anterior, in fact and
in principle, to the publication ... in *Critique*, of the articles
announcing *Of Grammatology;* the five last, beginning with "Freud and
the Scene of Writing" are engaged in the grammatological overture.
(*Pos* F 12--13)

Although Derrida continues "... things don't let themselves be
reconstituted so simply,"[]{#calibre_link-1787} this fable of
fragmentation is not without interest. There is a certain
stitched-togetherness in *Of Grammatology*, and a decided disjunction
between the sweeping, summarizing, theoretical breadth of the first
part, and the interpretative, slow, reader's pace of the second.

[Part I](#calibre_link-141){.nounder} is an expanded version of a
two-part review of Madeleine V-David's *Le débat sur les écritures et
l'hiéroglyphe aux[]{#calibre_link-1788} xvii° et xviii° siècles*, André
Lerori-Gourhan's *Le geste et la parole*, and the papers of a colloquium
entitled *L'écriture et la psychologie des
peuples*.^[]{#calibre_link-548}[82](#calibre_link-142){.nounder}^
Although the review articles contained most of the material of the
entire [Part I](#calibre_link-141){.nounder} in their present order, it
is in [Chapter 3](#calibre_link-18){.nounder}---"Of Grammatology as A
Positive Science"---that their mark is most clearly felt. Each of the
three books reviewed receives[]{#calibre_link-1789} a section of the
chapter. The first gives a summary of the moment when grammatology could
historically have opened but did not, the moment of the decipherment of
non-European scripts. The second investigates the possible physiological
bases for the differentiation between writing and speech and genetic
writing as the determinant of life. The third deals with the
implications of varieties of "nonphonetic"[]{#calibre_link-1790}
writing. One cannot help wondering if all this overt interest in an
account of writing in the narrow sense---rather than in the
interpretation of texts---is not simply due to the regulating presence
of books to be reviewed.

Indeed, in [Part I](#calibre_link-141){.nounder} and in the postscript
to "Freud and the Scene of Writing," Derrida speaks most often of
re-writing the "history of writing" in []{#calibre_link-1791}something
suspiciously like the[]{#calibre_link-1792} narrow sense---"an immense
field where hitherto one has only done preparatory work" (ED 340).
"Writing" so envisaged is on the brink of becoming a unique signifier,
and Jacques Derrida's chief care. In his later work, the theoretical
significance of the structure of writing and the grammatological opening
remain intact. But he quietly drops the idea of being the authorized
grammatological historian[]{#calibre_link-1793} of writing in the narrow
sense. "Writing" then takes its place on the chain of substitutions. In
the *Grammatology*, then, we are at a specific and precarious moment in
Derrida's career.

It is fascinating to study the changes and interpolations made in the
text of the review articles as they were transformed into the book. (The
text *is* genuinely enriched as the appropriate "difference"-s are
changed[]{#calibre_link-1794} to "differance"-s.) Most of the changes
make the philosophical ground of the argument stronger. The superb
discussion of the proper name (136--37, 89--90) is a case in point. So
is the long footnote on the psychoanalysis of writing (132--34,
333--34), and the insertion of the remarks on the radical alterity
necessarily inhabiting the sign. (69, 47) So is the cautionary addition
on [page 125](#calibre_link-143){.nounder} (84).
(The[]{#calibre_link-1795} original version ran: "It \[genetic script\]
is a liberation which makes for the appearing of the *grammè* as such
and no doubt makes possible the emergence of 'writing' in the narrow
sense." *\[Crit* II. 46\] In the *Grammatology* Derrida annuls the
possibility of the *grammè* ever appearing *as such*. He adds the
following parenthesis after "as such": "\[that is to say according to a
new structure of nonpresence\],"[]{#calibre_link-1796} and goes on to
add the following sentences: "But one cannot think them \[the
structurations of this *grammè\]* without the most general concept of
the *gramm*è. That is irreducible and impregnable.")

From our point of view, what is most interesting is that the theme of
"sous rature" is given its development almost entirely in the book
rather than in the articles. As I have mentioned above,
Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1797} never discusses "sous rature" at great
length. But in the articles all we have is a *mention* of the practice
(*Crit* I. 1029) as it is to be found on [page
38](#calibre_link-144){.nounder} (23) of *Of Grammatology*. The use of
the crossed lines on [page 31](#calibre_link-145){.nounder} (19), the
discussion of Heidegger's notion of Being between pages 31 and 38
(19--23), the putting of "experience" under erasure on [page
89](#calibre_link-146){.nounder} (60--61), of the "past" on [page
97](#calibre_link-147){.nounder} (66--67),[]{#calibre_link-1798} and the
"originarity of the trace" on [page 110](#calibre_link-148){.nounder}
(75) are all passages only found in the book.

On the other hand, and curiously enough, the argument for historical
necessity seems also to have been emphasized as the review articles were
turned into the first part of the book. The first tiny change---from
"the phoneticization of writing dissimulated its own history while
producing it" (*Crit* I. 1017)[]{#calibre_link-1799} to "the
phoneticization of writing *must* dissimulate its own history while
producing it" (11, 3)---sets the tone for all the small
[]{#calibre_link-906}but weighty changes that will be made. They are not
many, but they are unequivocal. Most of them, naturally enough, are
confined to [Chapter 1](#calibre_link-10){.nounder}, "The End of the
Book and the Beginning of Writing." The paragraph beginning "these
disguises are not historical contingencies"[]{#calibre_link-1800} (17,
7; the article had only the first two sentences) is a representative
example. The repression of writing, and its recognition today, are seen
as historically necessary events. In a text where he elaborately
launches a theory against teleological patternings of history and
thought, where he delivers the notion of the play of necessity and
contingency, why does Derrida fabricate so strong an
argument[]{#calibre_link-1801} for historical necessity? Why is the
opening chapter---"The End of the Book and the Beginning of
Writing"---full of a slightly embarrassing messianic promise? If we
really do not believe in "epistemological cut-off points," or in the
possibility of stepping out of the metaphysical enclosure by simply
deciding to, or in the linearity of time, then with what seriousness can
we declare a different[]{#calibre_link-1802} "world to come," a world
where the "values of sign, speech, and writing," will be made to
tremble? (14, 5) How reconcile ourselves with this break between the
world of the past and the world of the future? It seems an empiricist
betrayal of the structure of difference and postponement, and any
deconstructive reading of Derrida will have to take this into account.

(We have seen that Derrida will[]{#calibre_link-1803} not call
grammatology a psychoanalysis of logocentrism. On [page
20](#calibre_link-149){.nounder} \[9--10\] of the *Grammatology*, there
is the merest hint of a psychoanalytical patterning of the history of
writing that Derrida does not pursue: "This situation \[the role of
writing in the naming of the human element\] has always already been
announced. Why is it today in the process of making itself recognized
*as such* and *after the[]{#calibre_link-1804} fact \[après coup\]"?*
Making itself recognized *as such*. Derrida makes an attempt on that
page at answering that part of the question in terms of the development
in ways and means of information retrieval, phonography, and
cybernetics, all joining forces with anthropology and the history of
writing---the sciences of man. But elsewhere in the book, as we have
seen, he emphasizes that the situation can[]{#calibre_link-1805} never
be recognized *as such*, that we must surrender ourselves to being
inscribed within the chain of future deconstructions and decipherings.
It is therefore the *après coup* that seems more interesting here. That
is the French word for Freud's *"Nachträglichkeit"*---translated into
English as "deferred action." As we recall, at the time that a stimulus
is received, it goes *either* into the perceptual[]{#calibre_link-1806}
system or into the Unconscious and produces a permanent trace. That
particular trace might be energized into consciousness (as Freud reminds
us over and over again, this topographical language must be used with
caution) long afterward---*nachträglich, après coup*. But it never comes
up *as such;* in fact, as Derrida argues, following Freud, the trace
*\[die Bahnung\]* itself is primary. There is no
"thing"[]{#calibre_link-1807} there in the
[]{#calibre_link-924}Unconscious but simply the possibility for this
particular path to be energized. When the track is opened up, and we
have the *après coup* perception of the originary trace, the impulse in
the Unconscious is not exhausted. Unconscious impulses are
indestructible. Now before the remarks about theoretical mathematics,
information retrieval *et alia* on [page
20](#calibre_link-149){.nounder} \[9--10\], Derrida slips
in,[]{#calibre_link-1808} immediately after the sentences we are
examining, the following words: "This question would call forth an
interminable analysis." "Interminable analysis." The words themselves
recall Freud's late essay "Analysis Terminable and
Interminable."^[]{#calibre_link-549}[83](#calibre_link-150){.nounder}^
The impulses in the Unconscious are indestructible, *après coup* they
come up into consciousness interminably, and thus constitute the
subject. A neurosis[]{#calibre_link-1809} can never be analyzed to the
full---the analysis would in fact, be interminable, if the practical
analyst did not terminate it. Is the trace of the repression of writing
in some indeterminate historical Unconscious "coming up" to our
consciousness at the present historical moment, *après coup?* Derrida
himself is clearly not willing to assume the responsibility for what
might seem a psychoanalytic[]{#calibre_link-1810} schema. This again is
an undertaking for a future deconstructor. Yet there is, no doubt, a
strong sympathy between Freud's notion of the theoretical impossibility
of a full analysis and Derrida's polemic of the need for the perpetual
renewal of the grammatological or deconstructive undertaking. In fact,
that is what all of Derrida's work on "writing" has presented---although
it seems to be receiving[]{#calibre_link-1811} articulation today,
variations of previous articulations have existed throughout history and
the complex will have to be confronted perpetually as the language of
confrontation, obeying our will to power, adapts to and is retrieved by
logocentrism, or, as Freud would say, with a little help from Heidegger,
as "the ego treats ![image](images/000006.jpg){.calibre7} itself
as[]{#calibre_link-1812} a new ![image](images/000002.jpg){.calibre7}
\[GW XVI. 84, SE XXIII. 238; erasures mine\] It seems quite plausible,
then, to ask: if "the Freudian discourse---its syntax or ... its work"
were delivered from "his necessarily metaphysical and traditional
concepts" \[ED 294\], would one be able to decipher a psychoanalytic
schema in the obstinate historical pattern of *Of
Grammatology?*[]{#calibre_link-1813})

There is also the shadow of a geographical pattern that falls upon the
first part of the book. The relationship between logocentrism and
ethnocentrism is indirectly invoked in the very first sentence of the
"Exergue." Yet, paradoxically, and almost by a reverse ethnocentrism,
Derrida insists that logocentrism is a property of the *West*. He does
this so frequently that a quotation would be
superfluous.[]{#calibre_link-1814} Although something of the Chinese
prejudice of the West is discussed in [Part
I](#calibre_link-141){.nounder}, the *East* is never seriously studied
or deconstructed in the Derridean text. Why then must it remain,
recalling Hegel and Nietzsche in their most cartological humors, as the
name of the limits of the text's knowledge?

[]{#calibre_link-995}The discussion of Lévi-Strauss in [Part
II](#calibre_link-101){.nounder}, the only genuinely polemical and
perhaps the least formally[]{#calibre_link-1815} awkward section of the
book, first appeared in 1966, as part of an issue on Lévi-Strauss of the
*Cahiers pour l'analyse* (IV, September-October, 1966).

Derrida chooses Lévi-Strauss as his subject because, "at once conserving
and annulling inherited conceptual oppositions, this thought, like
Saussure's, stands on a borderline: sometimes within an uncriticized
conceptuality, sometimes putting a strain[]{#calibre_link-1816} on the
boundaries, and working toward deconstruction" (154, 105). And he takes
Lévi-Strauss to task for slackness of method, for sentimental
ethnocentrism, for an oversimplified reading of Rousseau. He criticizes
Lévi-Strauss for conceiving of writing only in the narrow sense, for
seeing it as a scapegoat for all the exploitative evils of
"civilization," and for conceiving of the violent
Nambikwara[]{#calibre_link-1817} as an innocent community "without
writing." If the end of [Part I](#calibre_link-141){.nounder} seems too
concerned with writing in the narrow sense, these chapters redeem
themselves in that respect. For in them Derrida repeatedly moves us from
writing in the narrow sense to writing in general---through such
"systematic" statements as: "the genealogical relation and social
classification are the stitched seam of
arche-writing,[]{#calibre_link-1818} condition of the (so-called oral)
language, and of writing in the colloquial sense" (182, 125) to such
"poetic" ones as: "the *silva* \[forest\] is savage, the *via rupta*
\[path cut through\] is written ... it is difficult to imagine that
access to the possibility of road maps is not access to writing" (158,
108).

Perhaps the most interesting reason given for the impossibility of a
community without writing[]{#calibre_link-1819} is that the bestowing of
the proper name, something no society can avoid, is itself inhabited by
the structure of writing. For the phrase "proper name" signifies a
classification, an institution carrying the trace of history, into which
a certain sort of sign is made to fit. Thus the proper name, as soon as
it is understood as such, is no longer fully unique and proper to the
holder. The proper[]{#calibre_link-1820} name is always already common
by virtue of belonging to the category "proper." It is always already
under erasure: "When within *consciousness*, the name *is called*
proper, it is already classified and is obliterated in *being named*. It
is already no more than a *so-called* proper name" (161, 109).
Lévi-Strauss knows this, as his discussion of proper names in *The
Savage Mind* (pp. 226f., Eng. pp. 172f.)[]{#calibre_link-1821}
demonstrates. But, having nothing but a restricted concept of writing,
he cannot relate the proper name to writing: "The essence or the energy
of the *graphein ...* \[is\] the originary effacement of the proper
name" (159, 108).

This argument does not only serve to undo the anthropoloigst's reverse
ethnocentrism toward an "innocent community without writing." It points
to the presence of writing in[]{#calibre_link-1822} general in all the
ramifications of the []{#calibre_link-925}"proper"---the own, the
distinguishing characteristic, the literal, the exclusively clean. It is
so pervasive a Derridean theme that I can do no more than mention it
here. In a way, Derrida's chief concern might be summarized thus: to
problematize the proper name and proper (literal) meaning, the proper in
general.

The argument points also to the theme of[]{#calibre_link-1823} the play
of desire around the proper name: The narcissistic desire to make one's
own "proper" name "common," to make it enter and be at one with the body
of the mothertongue; and, at the same time, the oedipal desire to
preserve one's proper name, to see it as the analogon of the *name* of
the father. Much of Derrida's recent work meditates on this play. I
shall quote the beginning of *Glas*, where[]{#calibre_link-1824} Hegel
(the "proper" name) is invoked as the eagle (the "common" name) that the
French pronunciation of his name---"aigle"---turns him into:

Who, he?

His name is so strange. From the eagle he draws his imperial or
historical power. Those who still pronounce it as French, and there are
those, are silly only to a certain point: the restitution ... of the
magisterial cold ... of the eagle caught in ice[]{#calibre_link-1825}
and frost *\[gel\]*. Let the emblemished philosopher be thus congealed.
(p. 7)

Pages 145 to 151 (97--102) are a theoretical "justification" of what
Derrida will come to call "intertextuality:" the interweaving of
different texts (literally "web"-s) in an act of criticism that refuses
to think of "influence" or "interrelationship" as simple historical
phenomena. Intertextuality becomes the most
striking[]{#calibre_link-1826} conceptual and typographical signature in
[]{#calibre_link-1827}[]{#calibre_link-1828}*Glas*. Pages 226 to 234
(157--64)---"The Exorbitant: Question of Method"---are, as I have
suggested, a simple and moving exposition of the method of
deconstruction as understood by the early Derrida.

Rousseau's place in Derrida's text is most importantly marked by the
former's use of the word "supplement": "Writing will appear to me more
and more," Derrida writes, "as another name for this
structure[]{#calibre_link-1829} of supplementarity. ... It does not
suffice to say that Rousseau thinks the supplement without thinking it,
that he does not match his saying and his meaning, his descriptions and
his declarations. ... Using the word and describing the thing, Rousseau
in a way displaces and deforms the sign 'supplement,' the unity of the
signifier and the signified. ... But these displacements and
deformations are regulated[]{#calibre_link-1830} by the contradictory
unity---itself supplementary---of a desire" (348, 245). Of the issue of
supplementarity itself, abundantly developed by Derrida in this book,
there is no need to speak. Of more interest to me is the question, how
does the word "supplement" signify Rousseau's desire? Before I attempt
to gauge []{#calibre_link-1053}Derrida's enigmatic answer to this
question, I shall digress and point at the rather
endearing[]{#calibre_link-1831} conservatism of [Chapter
3](#calibre_link-18){.nounder}, Section I: "The Place of the Essay."

There is a certain mark of superior academic scholarship in that section
that seems out of joint with the theoretical spirit of the book. Here
the philosopher who has written "The outside
![image](images/000004.jpg){.calibre7} the inside" in [Part
I](#calibre_link-141){.nounder}, speaks with perfect seriousness about
internal and external evidence,[]{#calibre_link-1832} and the thinker of
"intertextuality" concerns himself with the relative dating of *The
Essay on the Origin of Languages* and *The Discourse on Inequality*.
This reader is happy that those marks of traditional scholarship were
not unstitched. It is engrossing to watch the bold argument operating in
the service of a conventional debate. For the burden of the proof lies
on "the economy of pity"---the supplementarity[]{#calibre_link-1833} of
pity in both Rousseau texts---and intertextual practice does emerge as
the two texts are woven together: "From one \[text\] to the other, an
emphasis is displaced, a continuous sliding is in operation. ... The
Discourse wants to *mark the beginning. ...* The Essay would make us
*sense the beginnings*.... It seizes man ... in that subtle transition
from origin to genesis. ... The description of pure nature
in[]{#calibre_link-1834} the *Discourse* made room within itself for
such a transition. As always, it is the unseizable limit of the
*almost"* (358, 253). I do not believe that Derrida ever again devotes
himself to this sort of textual scholarship. Here, too, the reading of
*Of Grammatology* gives us the taste of a rather special early Derrida,
the young scholar transforming the ground rules of scholarship.

The book ends with[]{#calibre_link-1835} Rousseau's dream, the
supplementary desire that I refer to above. Such an ending is a
characteristic Derrida touch, criticism giving up the idiom of
expository mastery in the end and taking on the idiom of the fabulist.
"La pharmacie de Platon" ends with the scene of Plato in his pharmacy,
"White Mythology" with the heliotrope stone. Examples can be multiplied.

Rousseau, that famous masturbator,[]{#calibre_link-1836} has a
philosophical wet dream: "Rousseau's dream consisted of making the
supplement enter metaphysics by force" (444, 315).

But is not that force precisely the energy of Derrida's own project? Is
this not precisely the trick of writing, that dream-cum-truth, that
breaches the metaphysical closure with an intrinsic yet supplementary
violence? At the end of Derrida's book on Rousseau,
Rousseau[]{#calibre_link-1837} is set dreaming of Derrida. Perhaps the
book does end with its author's signature.

It is customary at this point to say a few words about the problem of
translation. Derrida's text certainly offers its share of
"untranslatable" words. I have had my battles with "exergue" and
"propre."^[]{#calibre_link-550}[84](#calibre_link-151){.nounder}^ My
special worry is []{#calibre_link-1838}"entamer." As we have seen, it is
an important word in Derrida's vocabulary. It means
both[]{#calibre_link-1839} to break into and to begin. I have made do
with "broach" or "breach," with the somewhat fanciful confidence that
the shadow-word "breach" or "broach" will declare itself through it.
With "entamer" as well as with other words and expressions, I have
included the original in parenthesis whenever the wording and syntax of
the French seemed to carry a special charge. To an extent, this
particular[]{#calibre_link-1840} problem informs the entire text.
Denying the uniqueness of words, their substantiality, their
transferability, their repeatability, *Of Grammatology* denies the
possibility of translation. Not so paradoxically perhaps, each twist of
phrase becomes at the same time "significant" and playful when language
is manipulated for the purpose of putting signification into question,
for deconstructing the[]{#calibre_link-1841} binary opposition
"signifier-signified." That playfulness I fear I have not been able
remotely to capture. Even so simple a word as "de" carries a touch of
play---hinting at both "of" and "from." (I have once resorted to
"from/of," where the playfulness seemed to ask for special recognition
\[[page 269](#calibre_link-152){.nounder}\].) But that sort of
heavy-handedness cannot punctuate an entire text where "penser" (to
think) carries[]{#calibre_link-1842} within itself and points at
"panser" (to dress a wound); for does not thinking seek forever to clamp
a dressing over the gaping and violent wound of the impossibility of
thought? The translation of the title, suggesting "a piece of" as well
as "about," I have retained against expert counsel.

I began this preface by informing my readers that Derrida's theory
admitted---as it denied---a preface by[]{#calibre_link-1843} questioning
the absolute repeatability of the text. It is now time to acknowledge
that his theory would likewise admit---as it denies---translation, by
questioning the absolute privilege of the original. Any act of reading
is besieged and delivered by the precariousness of intertextuality. And
translation is, after all, one version of
intertextuality.^[]{#calibre_link-551}[85](#calibre_link-153){.nounder}^
If there are no unique words, if, as soon as[]{#calibre_link-1844} a
privileged concept-word emerges, it must be given over to the chain of
substitutions and to the "common language," why should that act of
substitution that is translation be suspect? If the proper name or
sovereign status of the author is as much a barrier as a right of way,
why should the translator's position be secondary? It must now be
evident that, desiring to conserve the "original"
(*[]{#calibre_link-1845}De la grammatologie*) and seduced by the freedom
of the absence of a sovereign text (not only is there no *Of
Grammatology* before mine, but there have been as many translations of
the text as readings, the text is infinitely translatable), translation
itself is in a double bind (see pages lxxvii-lxxviii).

And, from quite another point of view, most practically and rigorously
speaking, both Derrida[]{#calibre_link-1846} and I being very roughly
bilingual---his English a cut above my French---where does French end
and English begin?

[]{#calibre_link-947}I shall not launch my philosophy of translation
here. Instead I give you a glimpse of Derrida's:

Within the limits of its possibility, or its *apparent* possibility,
translation practices the difference between signified and signifier.
But, if this difference is never pure, translation[]{#calibre_link-1847}
is even less so, and a notion of *transformation* must be substituted
for the notion of translation: a regulated transformation of one
language by another, of one text by another. We shall not have and never
have had to deal with some "transfer" of pure signifieds that the
signifying instrument---or "vehicle"---would leave virgin and intact,
from one language to another, or within one and the same
language.[]{#calibre_link-1848} (*Pos* 31)

"From one language to another, *or* within one and the same language."
Translation is a version of the intertexuality that comes to bear also
within the "same" language. Ergo ...

Heidegger's deconstructive (or "destructive") method is often based on
consideration of how the so-called content of philosophy is affected by
the exigencies of translation. Derrida writes of this in "La
différance"[]{#calibre_link-1849} and "Ousia et grammè." (*MP* 3--29, SP
129--60; MP 31--78) In the latter example there is a double play:
Heidegger laments the loss for philosophy when the lone latin "presence"
was pressed into service to translate the many nuanced Greek words
signifying philosophical shadings of the idea of presence. Derrida
engages in the parallel lament---how translate the many nuanced
Heideggerian German words signifying[]{#calibre_link-1850} philosophical
shadings of the idea of presence through the lone Romance "présence?"
Derrida goes on to use the business of "mistranslations" as an effective
deconstructive lever of his own. The most sustained example is "La
pharmacie de Platon," where he appropriately asks: why have translators
obliterated the word *"pharmakon"* by providing a collection of
different words as its translated substitute?

[]{#calibre_link-1851}
:::

And all said and done, that is the sort of reader I would hope for. A
reader who would fasten upon my mistranslations, and with that leverage
deconstruct Derrida's text beyond what Derrida as controlling subject
has directed in it.

## []{#calibre_link-956 .calibre3}***Preface*** {#calibre_link-7 .h1}

The first part of this book, "Writing before the
Letter,"^[]{#calibre_link-552}[1](#calibre_link-155){.nounder}^ sketches
in broad outlines a theoretical matrix. It indicates certain significant
historical moments, and proposes certain critical concepts.

These critical concepts are put to the test in the second part, "Nature,
Culture, Writing." This is the moment, as it were, of the example,
although strictly speaking, that notion is not[]{#calibre_link-1857}
acceptable within my argument. I have tried to defend, patiently and at
length, the choice of these examples (as I have called them for the sake
of convenience) and the necessity for their presentation. It is a
question of a reading of what may perhaps be called the "age" of
Rousseau. A reading merely outlined; considering the need for such an
analysis, the difficulty of the problems, and the
nature[]{#calibre_link-1858} of my project, I have felt justified in
selecting a short and little-known text, the *Essay on the Origin of
Languages*.[]{#calibre_link-1105}[\*](#calibre_link-156){.nounder} I
shall have to explain the privileged place I give to that work. There is
yet another reason why my reading might be incomplete: although I have
no ambition to illustrate a new method, I have attempted to produce,
often embarrassing myself in the process, the problems of
critical[]{#calibre_link-1859} reading. These problems are at all times
related to the guiding intention of this book. My interpretation of
Rousseau's text follows implicitly the propositions ventured in [Part
I](#calibre_link-141){.nounder}; propositions that demand that reading
should free itself, at least in its axis, from the classical categories
of history---not only from the categories of the history of ideas and
the history of literature but also, and[]{#calibre_link-1860} perhaps
above all, from the categories of the history of philosophy.

It goes without saying that around that axis I have had to respect
classical norms, or at least I have attempted to respect them. Although
the word "age" or "epoch" can be given more than these determinations, I
should mention that I have concerned myself with a *structural figure*
as much as a *historical totality*. I have
attempted[]{#calibre_link-1861} to relate these two seemingly necessary
approaches, thus repeating the question of the text, its historical
status, its proper time and space. The age already in the *past* is in
fact constituted in every respect as a *text*, in a sense of these words
that I []{#calibre_link-1862}shall have to establish. As such the age
conserves the values of legibility and the efficacy of a model and thus
disturbs the time (tense) of[]{#calibre_link-1863} the line or the line
of time. I have tried to suggest this by calling upon and questioning
the declared Rousseauism of a modern anthropologist.

### ***Exergue*** {#calibre_link-9 .h2}

[]{#calibre_link-937}1. The one who will shine in the science of writing
will shine like the sun. A scribe (*EP*, p. 87)

O Samas (sun-god), by your light you scan the totality of lands as if
they were cuneiform signs (ibid.).

2\. These three ways of writing correspond almost exactly to three
different stages according to which one can consider men gathered into a
nation. The depicting[]{#calibre_link-1868} of objects is appropriate to
a savage people; signs of words and of propositions, to a barbaric
people; and the alphabet to civilized people. J.-J. Rousseau, *Essai sur
l'origine des langues*.

3\. Alphabetic script is in itself and for itself the most intelligent.
Hegel, *Enzyklopädie*.

This triple exergue is intended not only to focus attention on the
*ethnocentrism* which, everywhere and always,[]{#calibre_link-1869} had
controlled the concept of writing. Nor merely to focus attention on what
I shall call *logocentrism:* the metaphysics of phonetic writing (for
example, of the alphabet) which was fundamentally---for enigmatic yet
essential reasons that are inaccessible to a simple historical
relativism---nothing but the most original and powerful ethnocentrism,
in the process of imposing itself upon the world,
controlling[]{#calibre_link-1870} in one and the same *order:*

1\. *the concept of writing* in a world where the phoneticization of
writing must dissimulate its own history as it is produced;

2\. *the history of* (the only) *metaphysics*, which has, in spite of
all differences, not only from Plato to Hegel (even including Leibniz)
but also, beyond these apparent limits, from the pre-Socratics to
Heidegger, always assigned the origin of[]{#calibre_link-1871} truth in
general to the logos: the history of truth, of the truth of truth, has
always been---except for a metaphysical diversion that we shall have to
explain---the debasement of writing, and its repression outside "full"
speech.

3\. *the concept of science* or the scientificity of science---what has
always been determined as *logic---a* concept that has always been a
philosophical concept, even if the practice[]{#calibre_link-1872} of
science has constantly challenged its imperialism of the logos, by
invoking, for example, from the beginning and ever increasingly,
nonphonetic writing. No doubt this subversion has always been contained
within a system of direct address *\[système allocutoire\]* which gave
birth to the project of science and to the conventions of all
nonphonetic
characteristics.^[]{#calibre_link-553}[1](#calibre_link-157){.nounder}^
It could not have been otherwise.[]{#calibre_link-1873} Nonetheless,
[]{#calibre_link-1874}it is a peculiarity of our epoch that, at the
moment when the phoneticization of writing---the historical origin and
structural possibility of philosophy as of science, the condition of the
*epistémè*---begins to lay hold on world
culture,^[]{#calibre_link-554}[2](#calibre_link-158){.nounder}^ science,
in its advancements, can no longer be satisfied with it. This
inadequation had always already begun to make its presence felt. But
today something[]{#calibre_link-1875} lets it appear as such, allows it
a kind of takeover without our being able to translate this novelty into
clear cut notions of mutation, explicitation, accumulation, revolution,
or tradition. These values belong no doubt to the system whose
dislocation is today presented as such, they describe the styles of an
historical movement which was meaningful---like the concept of history
itself---only[]{#calibre_link-1876} within a logocentric epoch.

By alluding to a science of writing reined in by metaphor, metaphysics,
and theology,^[]{#calibre_link-555}[3](#calibre_link-159){.nounder}^
this exergue must not only announce that the science of
writing---*grammatology^[]{#calibre_link-556}[4](#calibre_link-160){.nounder}^*---shows
signs of liberation all over the world, as a result of decisive efforts.
These efforts are necessarily discreet, dispersed, almost imperceptible;
that is a quality of their meaning and of the
milieu[]{#calibre_link-1877} within which they produce their operation.
I would like to suggest above all that, however fecund and necessary the
undertaking might be, and even if, given the most favorable hypothesis,
it did overcome all technical and epistemological obstacles as well as
all the theological and metaphysical impediments that have limited it
hitherto, such a science of writing runs the risk of never being
established[]{#calibre_link-1878} as such and with that name. Of never
being able to define the unity of its project or its object. Of not
being able either to write its discourse on method or to describe the
limits of its field. For essential reasons: the unity of all that allows
itself to be attempted today through the most diverse concepts of
science and of writing, is, in principle, more or less covertly yet
always, determined[]{#calibre_link-1879} by an historico-metaphysical
epoch of which we merely glimpse the *closure*. I do not say the *end*.
The idea of science and the idea of writing---therefore also of the
science of writing---is meaningful for us only in terms of an origin and
within a world to which a certain concept of the sign (later I shall
call it *the* concept of sign) and a certain concept of the
relationships between speech and writing,[]{#calibre_link-1880} have
*already* been assigned. A most determined relationship, in spite of its
privilege, its necessity, and the field of vision that it has controlled
for a few millennia, especially in the West, to the point of being now
able to produce its own dislocation and itself proclaim its limits.

Perhaps patient meditation and painstaking investigation on and around
what is still provisionally called writing,[]{#calibre_link-1881} far
from falling short of a science of writing or of hastily dismissing it
by some obscurantist reaction, letting it rather develop its positivity
as far as possible, are the wanderings of a way of thinking that is
faithful and attentive to the ineluctable world of the future which
proclaims itself at present, beyond the closure of knowledge.
[]{#calibre_link-1882}The future can only be anticipated in the form of
an[]{#calibre_link-1883} absolute danger. It is that which breaks
absolutely with constituted normality and can only be proclaimed,
*presented*, as a sort of monstrosity. For that future world and for
that within it which will have put into question the values of sign,
word, and writing, for that which guides our future anterior, there is
as yet no exergue.

### []{#calibre_link-1011 .calibre3}**1 *The End of the Book and the Beginning of Writing*** {#calibre_link-10 .h2}

***Socrates, he who does not
write**[]{#calibre_link-1107}[\*](#calibre_link-162){.nounder}---Nietzsche*

However the topic is considered, the *problem of language* has never
been simply one problem among others. But never as much as at present
has it invaded, *as such*, the global horizon of the most diverse
researches and the most heterogeneous discourses, diverse and
heterogeneous in their intention, method,[]{#calibre_link-1886} and
ideology. The devaluation of the word "language" itself, and how, in the
very hold it has upon us, it betrays a loose vocabulary, the temptation
of a cheap seduction, the passive yielding to fashion, the consciousness
of the avant-garde, in other words---ignorance---are evidences of this
effect. This inflation of the sign "language" is the inflation of the
sign itself, absolute inflation, inflation[]{#calibre_link-1887} itself.
Yet, by one of its aspects or shadows, it is itself still a sign: this
crisis is also a symptom. It indicates, as if in spite of itself, that a
historico-metaphysical epoch *must* finally determine as language the
totality of its problematic horizon. It must do so not only because all
that desire had wished to wrest from the play of language finds itself
recaptured within that play but also[]{#calibre_link-1888} because, for
the same reason, language itself is menaced in its very life, helpless,
adrift in the threat of limitlessness, brought back to its own finitude
at the very moment when its limits seem to disappear, when it ceases to
be self-assured, contained, and *guaranteed* by the infinite signified
which seemed to exceed it.

#### ***The Program*** {#calibre_link-11 .h3}

By a slow movement whose necessity is hardly
perceptible,[]{#calibre_link-1889} everything that for at least some
twenty centuries tended toward and finally succeeded in being gathered
under the name of language is beginning to let itself be transferred to,
or at least summarized under, the name of writing. By a hardly
perceptible necessity, it seems as though the concept of writing---no
[]{#calibre_link-1035}longer indicating a particular, derivative,
auxiliary form of language in general (whether[]{#calibre_link-1890}
understood as communication, relation, expression, signification,
constitution of meaning or thought, etc.), no longer designating the
exterior surface, the insubstantial double of a major signifier, *the
signifier of the signifier*---is beginning to go beyond the extension of
language. In all senses of the word, writing thus *comprehends*
language. Not that the word "writing" has ceased to
designate[]{#calibre_link-1891} the signifier of the signifier, but it
appears, strange as it may seem, that "signifier of the signifier" no
longer defines accidental doubling and fallen secondarity. "Signifier of
the signifier" describes on the contrary the movement of language: in
its origin, to be sure, but one can already suspect that an origin whose
structure can be expressed as "signifier of the signifier" conceals and
erases[]{#calibre_link-1892} itself in its own production. There the
signified always already functions as a signifier. The secondarity that
it seemed possible to ascribe to writing alone affects all signifieds in
general, affects them always already, the moment they *enter the game*.
There is not a single signified that escapes, even if recaptured, the
play of signifying references that constitute language. The advent of
writing[]{#calibre_link-1893} is the advent of this play; today such a
play is coming into its own, effacing the limit starting from which one
had thought to regulate the circulation of signs, drawing along with it
all the reassuring signifieds, reducing all the strongholds, all the
out-of-bounds shelters that watched over the field of language. This,
strictly speaking, amounts to destroying the concept of "sign" and
its[]{#calibre_link-1894} entire logic. Undoubtedly it is not by chance
that this *overwhelming* supervenes at the moment when the extension of
the concept of language effaces all its limits. We shall see that this
overwhelming and this effacement have the same meaning, are one and the
same phenomenon. It is as if the Western concept of language (in terms
of what, beyond its plurivocity and beyond the strict and
problematic[]{#calibre_link-1895} opposition of speech *\[parole\]* and
language *\[langue\]*, attaches it *in general* to phonematic or
glossematic production, to language, to voice, to hearing, to sound and
breadth, to speech) were revealed today as the guise or disguise of a
primary writing:^[]{#calibre_link-557}[1](#calibre_link-163){.nounder}^
more fundamental than that which, before this conversion, passed for the
simple "supplement to the spoken word" (Rousseau). Either writing
was[]{#calibre_link-1896} never a simple "supplement," or it is urgently
necessary to construct a new logic of the "supplement." It is this
urgency which will guide us further in reading Rousseau.

These disguises are not historical contingencies that one might admire
or regret. Their movement was absolutely necessary, with a necessity
which cannot be judged by any other tribunal. The privilege of the
*phone* does not depend[]{#calibre_link-1897} upon a choice that could
have been avoided. It responds to a moment of *economy* (let us say of
the "life" of "history" or of "being as self-relationship"). The system
of "hearing (understanding)-oneself-speak" through the phonic
substance---which *presents itself* as the nonexterior,
[]{#calibre_link-1898}nonmundane, therefore nonempirical or
noncontingent signifier---has necessarily dominated the history of the
world during[]{#calibre_link-1899} an entire epoch, and has even
produced the idea of the world, the idea of world-origin, that arises
from the difference between the worldly and the non-worldly, the outside
and the inside, ideality and nonideality, universal and nonuniversal,
transcendental and empirical,
etc.^[]{#calibre_link-558}[2](#calibre_link-164){.nounder}^

With an irregular and essentially precarious success, this movement
would apparently have tended, as toward its
*telos*[]{#calibre_link-1900}, to confine writing to a secondary and
instrumental function: translator of a full speech that was fully
*present* (present to itself, to its signified, to the other, the very
condition of the theme of presence in general), technics in the service
of language, *spokesman*, interpreter of an originary speech itself
shielded from interpretation.

Technics in the service of language: I am not
invoking[]{#calibre_link-1901} a general essence of technics which would
be already familiar to us and would help us in *understanding* the
narrow and historically determined concept of writing as an example. I
believe on the contrary that a certain sort of question about the
meaning and origin of writing precedes, or at least merges with, a
certain type of question about the meaning and origin of technics. That
is why the notion[]{#calibre_link-1902} of technique can never simply
clarify the notion of writing.

It is therefore as if what we call language could have been in its
origin and in its end only a moment, an essential but determined mode, a
phenomenon, an aspect, a species of writing. And as if it had succeeded
in making us forget this, and *in wilfully misleading us*, only in the
course of an adventure: as that adventure itself.
All[]{#calibre_link-1903} in all a short enough adventure. It merges
with the history that has associated technics and logocentric
metaphysics for nearly three millennia. And it now seems to be
approaching what is really its own *exhaustion;* under the
circumstances---and this is no more than one example among others---of
this death of the civilization of the book, of which so much is said and
which manifests itself particularly[]{#calibre_link-1904} through a
convulsive proliferation of libraries. All appearances to the contrary,
this death of the book undoubtedly announces (and in a certain sense
always has announced) nothing but a death of speech (of a *so-called*
full speech) and a new mutation in the history of writing, in history as
writing. Announces it at a distance of a few centuries. It is on that
scale that we must reckon it here,[]{#calibre_link-1905} being careful
not to neglect the quality of a very heterogeneous historical duration:
the acceleration is such, and such its qualitative meaning, that one
would be equally wrong in making a careful evaluation according to past
rhythms. "Death of speech" is of course a metaphor here: before we speak
of disappearance, we must think of a new situation for speech, of its
subordination within a structure[]{#calibre_link-1906} of which it will
no longer be the archon.

To affirm in this way that the concept of writing exceeds and
comprehends that of language, presupposes of course a certain definition
of language []{#calibre_link-1907}and of writing. If we do not attempt
to justify it, we shall be giving in to the movement of inflation that
we have just mentioned, which has also taken over the word "writing,"
and that not fortuitously. For[]{#calibre_link-1908} some time now, as a
matter of fact, here and there, by a gesture and for motives that are
profoundly necessary, whose degradation is easier to denounce than it is
to disclose their origin, one says "language" for action, movement,
thought, reflection, consciousness, unconsciousness, experience,
affectivity, etc. Now we tend to say "writing" for all that and more: to
designate not only the physical[]{#calibre_link-1909} gestures of
literal pictographic or ideographic inscription, but also the totality
of what makes it possible; and also, beyond the signifying face, the
signified face itself. And thus we say "writing" for all that gives rise
to an inscription in general, whether it is literal or not and even if
what it distributes in space is alien to the order of the voice:
cinematography, choreography, of course,[]{#calibre_link-1910} but also
pictorial, musical, sculptural "writing." One might also speak of
athletic writing, and with even greater certainty of military or
political writing in view of the techniques that govern those domains
today. All this to describe not only the system of notation secondarily
connected with these activities but the essence and the content of these
activities themselves. It is also in this[]{#calibre_link-1911} sense
that the contemporary biologist speaks of writing and *pro-gram* in
relation to the most elementary processes of information within the
living cell. And, finally, whether it has essential limits or not, the
entire field covered by the cybernetic *program* will be the field of
writing. If the theory of cybernetics is by itself to oust all
metaphysical concepts---including the concepts of
soul,[]{#calibre_link-1912} of life, of value, of choice, of
memory---which until recently served to separate the machine from
man,^[]{#calibre_link-559}[3](#calibre_link-165){.nounder}^ it must
conserve the notion of writing, trace, grammè \[written mark\], or
grapheme, until its own historico-metaphysical character is also
exposed. Even before being determined as human (with all the distinctive
characteristics that have always been attributed to man and the entire
system of significations[]{#calibre_link-1913} that they imply) or
nonhuman, the *grammè---or* the *grapheme*---would thus name the
element. An element without simplicity. An element, whether it is
understood as the medium or as the irreducible atom, of the
arche-synthesis in general, of what one must forbid oneself to define
within the system of oppositions of metaphysics, of what consequently
one should not even call *experience* in general,
that[]{#calibre_link-1914} is to say the origin of *meaning* in general.

This situation has always already been announced. Why is it today in the
process of making itself known *as such* and *after the fact?* This
question would call forth an interminable analysis. Let us simply choose
some points of departure in order to introduce the limited remarks to
which I shall confine myself. I have already alluded to *theoretical*
mathematics;[]{#calibre_link-1915} its writing---whether understood as a
sensible *graphie* \[manner of writing\] (and that already presupposes
an identity, therefore an ideality, of its form, which
[]{#calibre_link-948}in principle renders absurd the so easily admitted
notion of the "sensible signifier"), or understood as the ideal
synthesis of signifieds or a trace operative on another level, or
whether it is understood, more profoundly, as the
*passage*[]{#calibre_link-1916} of the one to the other---has never been
absolutely linked with a phonetic production. Within cultures practicing
so-called phonetic writing, mathematics is not just an enclave. That is
mentioned by all historians of writing; they recall at the same time the
imperfections of alphabetic writing, which passed for so long as the
most convenient and "the most
intelligent"^[]{#calibre_link-560}[4](#calibre_link-166){.nounder}^
writing. This enclave is also[]{#calibre_link-1917} the place where the
practice of scientific language challenges intrinsically and with
increasing profundity the ideal of phonetic writing and all its implicit
metaphysics (metaphysics *itself*), particularly, that is, the
philosophical idea of the *epistémè;* also of *istoria*, a concept
profoundly related to it in spite of the dissociation or opposition
which has distinguished one from the other during[]{#calibre_link-1918}
one phase of their common progress. History and knowledge, *istoria* and
*epistémè* have always been determined (and not only etymologically or
philosophically) as detours *for the purpose of* the reappropriaton of
presence.

But beyond theoretical mathematics, the development of the *practical
methods* of information retrieval extends the possibilities of the
"message" vastly, to the point where it is[]{#calibre_link-1919} no
longer the "written" translation of a language, the transporting of a
signified which could remain spoken in its integrity. It goes hand in
hand with an extension of phonography and of all the means of conserving
the spoken language, of making it function without the presence of the
speaking subject. This development, coupled with that of anthropology
and of the history of writing, teaches us[]{#calibre_link-1920} that
phonetic writing, the medium of the great metaphysical, scientific,
technical, and economic adventure of the West, is limited in space and
time and limits itself even as it is in the process of imposing its laws
upon the cultural areas that had escaped it. But this nonfortuitous
conjunction of cybernetics and the "human sciences" of writing leads to
a more profound reversal.

#### ***The Signifier*** {#calibre_link-12 .h3}

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1921}
:::

and Truth

The "rationality"---but perhaps that word should be abandoned for
reasons that will appear at the end of this sentence---which governs a
writing thus enlarged and radicalized, no longer issues from a logos.
Further, it inaugurates the destruction, not the demolition but the
de-sedimentation, the de-construction, of all the significations that
have their source in that of the logos.
Particularly[]{#calibre_link-1922} the signification of *truth*. All the
metaphysical determinations of truth, and even the one beyond
metaphysical ontotheology that Heidegger reminds us of, are more or less
immediately inseparable from the instance of the logos, or of a reason
thought within the lineage of the logos, in whatever sense it is
understood: in the pre-Socratic []{#calibre_link-821}or the
philosophical sense, in the sense of God's
infinite[]{#calibre_link-1923} understanding or in the anthropological
sense, in the pre-Hegelian or the post-Hegelian sense. Within this
logos, the original and essential link to the *phonè* has never been
broken. It would be easy to demonstrate this and I shall attempt such a
demonstration later. As has been more or less implicitly determined, the
essence of the *phonè* would be immediately proximate to that which
within "thought"[]{#calibre_link-1924} as logos relates to "meaning,"
produces it, receives it, speaks it, "composes" it. If, for Aristotle,
for example, "spoken words (ta en tē phonē) are the symbols of mental
experience (pathēmata tes psychēs) and written words are the symbols of
spoken words" (*De interpretatione*, 1, 16a 3) it is because the voice,
producer of *the first symbols*, has a relationship of essential and
immediate proximity[]{#calibre_link-1925} with the mind. Producer of the
first signifier, it is not just a simple signifier among others. It
signifies "mental experiences" which themselves reflect or mirror things
by natural resemblance. Between being and mind, things and feelings,
there would be a relationship of translation or natural signification;
between mind and logos, a relationship of conventional symbolization.
And the *first*[]{#calibre_link-1926} convention, which would relate
immediately to the order of natural and universal signification, would
be produced as spoken language. Written language would establish the
conventions, interlinking other conventions with them.

Just as all men have not the same writing so all men have not the same
speech sounds, but mental experiences, of which these are the *primary
symbols (semeīa prótos*), are[]{#calibre_link-1927} the same for all, as
also are those things of which our experiences are the images (*De
interpretatione*, 1, 16a. Italics added).

The feelings of the mind, expressing things naturally, constitute a sort
of universal language which can then efface itself. It is the stage of
transparence. Aristotle can sometimes omit it without
risk.^[]{#calibre_link-561}[5](#calibre_link-167){.nounder}^ In every
case, the voice is closest to the signified,
whether[]{#calibre_link-1928} it is determined strictly as sense
(thought or lived) or more loosely as thing. All signifiers, and first
and foremost the written signifier, are derivative with regard to what
would wed the voice indissolubly to the mind or to the thought of the
signified sense, indeed to the thing itself (whether it is done in the
Aristotelian manner that we have just indicated or in the manner of
medieval theology,[]{#calibre_link-1929} determining the *res* as a
thing created from its *eidos*, from its sense thought in the logos or
in the infinite understanding of God). The written signifier is always
technical and representative. It has no constitutive meaning. This
derivation is the very origin of the notion of the "signifier." The
notion of the sign always implies within itself the distinction between
signifier and signified,[]{#calibre_link-1930} even if, as Saussure
argues, they are distinguished simply as the two faces of one and the
same leaf. This notion remains therefore within the heritage of that
logocentrism which is also a phonocentrism:
[]{#calibre_link-936}absolute proximity of voice and being, of voice and
the meaning of being, of voice and the ideality of meaning. Hegel
demonstrates very clearly the strange privilege of sound in
idealization,[]{#calibre_link-1931} the production of the concept and
the self-presence of the subject.

This ideal motion, in which through the sound what is as it were the
simple subjectivity *\[Subjektivität\]*, the soul of the material thing
expresses itself, the ear receives also in a theoretical
*\[theoretisch\]* way, just as the eye shape and colour, thus allowing
the interiority of the object to become interiority itself *\[läβt
dadurch[]{#calibre_link-1932} das Innere der Gegenstände für das Innere
selbst werden\] (Esthétique*, III. I tr. fr. p.
16).[]{#calibre_link-1109}[\*](#calibre_link-168){.nounder} ... The ear,
on the contrary, perceives *\[vernimmt\]* the result of that interior
vibration of material substance without placing itself in a practical
relation toward the objects, a result by means of which it is no longer
the material form *\[Gestalt\]* in its repose, but the first, more ideal
activity of the[]{#calibre_link-1933} soul itself which is manifested
*\[zum Vorschein kommt\]* (p.
296).[]{#calibre_link-1110}[†](#calibre_link-169){.nounder}

What is said of sound in general is a fortiori valid for the *phonè* by
which, by virtue of hearing (understanding)-oneself-speak---an
indissociable system---the subject affects itself and is related to
itself in the element of ideality.

We already have a foreboding that phonocentrism merges with the
historical determination of the meaning[]{#calibre_link-1934} of being
in general as *presence*, with all the subdeterminations which depend on
this general form and which organize within it their system and their
historical sequence (presence of the thing to the sight as *eidos*,
presence as substance/essence/existence *\[ousia\]*, temporal presence
as point *\[stigmè\]* of the now or of the moment *\[nun\]*, the
self-presence of the cogito, consciousness,
subjectivity,[]{#calibre_link-1935} the co-presence of the other and of
the self, intersubjectivity as the intentional phenomenon of the ego,
and so forth). Logocentrism would thus support the determination of the
being of the entity as presence. To the extent that such a logocentrism
is not totally absent from Heidegger's thought, perhaps it still holds
that thought within the epoch of onto-theology, within the philosophy of
presence,[]{#calibre_link-1936} that is to say within philosophy
*itself*. This would perhaps mean that one does not leave the epoch
whose closure one can outline. The movements of belonging or not
belonging to the epoch are too subtle, the illusions in that regard are
too easy, for us to make a definite judgment.

The epoch of the logos thus debases writing considered as mediation of
[]{#calibre_link-975}mediation and as a fall into the
exteriority[]{#calibre_link-1937} of meaning. To this epoch belongs the
difference between signified and signifier, or at least the strange
separation of their "parallelism," and the exteriority, however
extenuated, of the one to the other. This appurtenance is organized and
hierarchized in a history. The difference between signified and
signifier belongs in a profound and implicit way to the totality of the
great epoch covered[]{#calibre_link-1938} by the history of metaphysics,
and in a more explicit and more systematically articulated way to the
narrower epoch of Christian creationism and infinitism when these
appropriate the resources of Greek conceptuality. This appurtenance is
essential and irreducible; one cannot retain the convenience or the
"scientific truth" of the Stoic and later medieval opposition between
*signans* and *signatum*[]{#calibre_link-1939} without also bringing
with it all its metaphysico-theological roots. To these roots adheres
not only the distinction between the sensible and the
intelligible---already a great deal---with all that it controls, namely,
metaphysics in its totality. And this distinction is generally accepted
as self-evident by the most careful linguists and semiologists, even by
those who believe that the scientificity[]{#calibre_link-1940} of their
work begins where metaphysics ends. Thus, for example:

As modern structural thought has clearly realized, language is a system
of signs and linguistics is part and parcel of the science of signs, or
*semiotics* (Saussure's *sémiologie*). The mediaeval definition of
sign---*"aliquid stat pro aliquo"*---has been resurrected and put
forward as still valid and productive. Thus the constitutive
mark[]{#calibre_link-1941} of any sign in general and of any linguistic
sign in particular is its twofold character: every linguistic unit is
bipartite and involves both aspects---one sensible and the other
intelligible, or in other words, both the *signans* "signifier"
(Saussure's *signifiant*) and the *signatum* "signified" (*signifié*).
These two constituents of a linguistic sign (and of sign in general)
necessarily suppose and[]{#calibre_link-1942} require each
other.^[]{#calibre_link-562}[6](#calibre_link-170){.nounder}^

But to these metaphysico-theological roots many other hidden sediments
cling. The semiological or, more specifically, linguistic "science"
cannot therefore hold on to the difference between signifier and
signified---the very idea of the sign---without the difference between
sensible and intelligible, certainly, but also not without retaining,
more profoundly and more implicitly,[]{#calibre_link-1943} and by the
same token the reference to a signified able to "take place" in its
intelligibility, before its "fall," before any expulsion into the
exteriority of the sensible here below. As the face of pure
intelligibility, it refers to an absolute logos to which it is
immediately united. This absolute logos was an infinite creative
subjectivity in medieval theology: the intelligible face of
the[]{#calibre_link-1944} sign remains turned toward the word and the
face of God.

Of course, it is not a question of "rejecting" these notions; they are
necessary and, at least at present, nothing is conceivable for us
without them. It is a question at first of demonstrating the systematic
and historical []{#calibre_link-601}solidarity of the concepts and
gestures of thought that one often believes can be innocently separated.
The sign and[]{#calibre_link-1945} divinity have the same place and time
of birth. The age of the sign is essentially theological. Perhaps it
will never *end*. Its historical *closure* is, however, outlined.

Since these concepts are indispensable for unsettling the heritage to
which they belong, we should be even less prone to renounce them. Within
the closure, by an oblique and always perilous movement, constantly
risking falling[]{#calibre_link-1946} back within what is being
deconstructed, it is necessary to surround the critical concepts with a
careful and thorough discourse---to mark the conditions, the medium, and
the limits of their effectiveness and to designate rigorously their
intimate relationship to the machine whose deconstruction they permit;
and, in the same process, designate the crevice through which the yet
unnameable glimmer beyond[]{#calibre_link-1947} the closure can be
glimpsed. The concept of the sign is here exemplary. We have just marked
its metaphysical appurtenance. We know, however, that the thematics of
the sign have been for about a century the. agonized labor of a
tradition that professed to withdraw meaning, truth, presence, being,
etc., from the movement of signification. Treating as suspect, as I just
have, the difference between[]{#calibre_link-1948} signified and
signifier, or the idea of the sign in general, I must state explicitly
that it is not a question of doing so in terms of the instance of the
present truth, anterior, exterior or superior to the sign, or in terms
of the place of the effaced difference. Quite the contrary. We are
disturbed by that which, in the concept of the sign---which has never
existed or functioned outside the history[]{#calibre_link-1949} of (the)
philosophy (of presence)---remains systematically and genealogically
determined by that history. It is there that the concept and above all
the work of deconstruction, its "style," remain by nature exposed to
misunderstanding and nonrecognition.

The exteriority of the signifier is the exteriority of writing in
general, and I shall try to show later that there is no linguistic sign
before[]{#calibre_link-1950} writing. Without that exteriority, the very
idea of the sign falls into decay. Since our entire world and language
would collapse with it, and since its evidence and its value keep, to a
certain point of derivation, an indestructible solidity, it would be
silly to conclude from its placement within an epoch that it is
necessary to "move on to something else," to dispose of the sign, of the
term[]{#calibre_link-1951} and the notion. For a proper understanding of
the gesture that we are sketching here, one must understand the
expressions "epoch," "closure of an epoch," "historical genealogy" in a
new way; and must first remove them from all relativism.

Thus, within this epoch, reading and writing, the production or
interpretation of signs, the text in general as fabric of signs, allow
themselves to be confined[]{#calibre_link-1952} within secondariness.
They are preceded by a truth, or a meaning already constituted by and
within the element of the logos. Even when []{#calibre_link-856}the
thing, the "referent," is not immediately related to the logos of a
creator God where it began by being the spoken/thought sense, the
signified has at any rate an immediate relationship with the logos in
general (finite or infinite), and a mediated one
with[]{#calibre_link-1953} the signifier, that is to say with the
exteriority of writing. When it seems to go otherwise, it is because a
metaphoric mediation has insinuated itself into the relationship and has
simulated immediacy; the writing of truth in the soul, opposed by
*Phaedrus* (278a) to bad writing (writing in the "literal" *\[propre\]*
and ordinary sense, "sensible" writing, "in space"), the book of Nature
and God's[]{#calibre_link-1954} writing, especially in the Middle Ages;
all that functions as *metaphor* in these discourses confirms the
privilege of the logos and founds the "literal" meaning then given to
writing: a sign signifying a signifier itself signifying an eternal
verity, eternally thought and spoken in the proximity of a present
logos. The paradox to which attention must be paid is this: natural and
universal writing,[]{#calibre_link-1955} intelligible and nontemporal
writing, is thus named by metaphor. A writing that is sensible, finite,
and so on, is designated as writing in the literal sense; it is thus
thought on the side of culture, technique, and artifice; a human
procedure, the ruse of a being accidentally incarnated or of a finite
creature. Of course, this metaphor remains enigmatic and refers to a
"literal" meaning of writing[]{#calibre_link-1956} as the first
metaphor. This "literal" meaning is yet unthought by the adherents of
this discourse. It is not, therefore, a matter of inverting the literal
meaning and the figurative meaning but of determining the "literal"
meaning of writing as metaphoricity itself.

In "The Symbolism of the Book," that excellent chapter of *European
Literature and the Latin Middle Ages*, E. R. Curtius
describes[]{#calibre_link-1957} with great wealth of examples the
evolution that led from the *Phaedrus* to Calderon, until it seemed to
be "precisely the reverse" (tr. fr. p. 372)
[]{#calibre_link-1112}[\*](#calibre_link-171){.nounder} by the "newly
attained position of the book" (p. 374) \[p. 306\]. But it seems that
this modification, however important in fact it might be, conceals a
fundamental continuity. As was the case with the Platonic writing of the
truth in the soul, in the[]{#calibre_link-1958} Middle Ages too it is a
writing understood in the metaphoric sense, that is to say a *natural*,
eternal, and universal writing, the system of signified truth, which is
recognized in its dignity. As in the *Phaedrus*, a certain fallen
writing continues to be opposed to it. There remains to be written a
history of this metaphor, a metaphor that systematically contrasts
divine or natural writing and[]{#calibre_link-1959} the human and
laborious, finite and artificial inscription. It remains to articulate
rigorously the stages of that history, as marked by the quotations
below, and to follow the []{#calibre_link-850}theme of God's book
(nature or law, indeed natural law) through all its modifications.

Rabbi Eliezer said: "If all the seas were of ink, and all ponds planted
with reeds, if the sky and the earth were parchments and
if[]{#calibre_link-1960} all human beings practised the art of
writing---they would not exhaust the Torah I have learned, just as the
Torah itself would not be diminished any more than is the sea by the
water removed by a paint brush dipped in

supreme Wisdom uses in all its revelations to humanity---which is found

unvollkommensten\]*, is more like the metaphorical expression of the
dream than the prose of wakefulness, ... we may wonder if this
language[]{#calibre_link-1963} is not the true and wakeful language of
the superior regions. If, when we consider ourselves awakened, we are
not plunged in a millennial slumber, or at least in the echo of its
dreams, where we only perceive a few isolated and obscure words of God's
language, as a sleeper perceives the conversation of the people around
him."[]{#calibre_link-1117}[§](#calibre_link-176){.nounder}

to[]{#calibre_link-1964} a universal reading, which only existence

Above all, the profound differences distinguishing all these treatments
of the same metaphor must not be ignored. In the history of this
treatment, the most decisive separation appears at the moment when, at
the same time as the science of nature, the determination of absolute
presence is constituted as self-presence, as subjectivity.
It[]{#calibre_link-1965} is the moment of the great rationalisms of the
seventeenth century. From then on, the condemnation of fallen and finite
writing will take another form, within which we still
[]{#calibre_link-1063}live: it is non-self-presence that will be
denounced. Thus the exemplariness of the "Rousseauist" moment, which we
shall deal with later, begins to be explained. Rousseau repeats the
Platonic gesture by referring to another[]{#calibre_link-1966} model of
presence: self-presence in the senses, in the sensible cogito, which
simultaneously carries in itself the inscription of divine law. On the
one hand, *representative*, fallen, secondary, instituted writing,
writing in the literal and strict sense, is condemned in *The Essay on
the Origin of Languages* (it "enervates" speech; to "judge genius" from
books is like "painting a man's portrait[]{#calibre_link-1967} from his
corpse," etc.). Writing in the common sense is the dead letter, it is
the carrier of death. It exhausts life. On the other hand, on the other
face of the same proposition, writing in the metaphoric sense, natural,
divine, and living writing, is venerated; it is equal in dignity to the
origin of value, to the voice of conscience as divine law, to the heart,
to sentiment, and so forth.

[]{#calibre_link-1968}The Bible is the most sublime of all books, ...
but it is after all a book. ... It is not at all in a few sparse pages
that one should look for God's law, but in the human heart where His
hand deigned to write (*Lettre* à
*Vernes).[]{#calibre_link-1120}[\*](#calibre_link-178){.nounder}*

If the natural law had been written only in the human reason, it would
be little capable of directing most of our actions. But it is also
engraved in the heart of man in[]{#calibre_link-1969} ineffacable
characters. ... There it cries to him (*L'état de
guerre*.)[]{#calibre_link-1121}[†](#calibre_link-179){.nounder}

Natural writing is immediately united to the voice and to breath. Its
nature is not grammatological but pneumatological. It is hieratic, very
close to the interior holy voice of the *Profession of Faith*, to the
voice one hears upon retreating into oneself: full and truthful presence
of the divine voice to our inner sense: "The[]{#calibre_link-1970} more
I retreat into myself, the more I consult myself, the more plainly do I
read these words written in my soul: be just and you will be happy. ...
I do not derive these rules from the principles of the higher
philosophy, I find them in the depths of my heart written by nature in
characters which nothing can
efface."[]{#calibre_link-1122}[††](#calibre_link-180){.nounder}

There is much to say about the fact that the native unity of the voice
and[]{#calibre_link-1971} writing is *prescriptive*. Arche-speech is
writing because it is a law. A natural law. The beginning word is
understood, in the intimacy of self-presence, as the voice of the other
and as commandment.

There is therefore a good and a bad writing: the good and natural is the
divine inscription in the heart and the soul; the perverse and artful is
technique, exiled in the exteriority of the body.[]{#calibre_link-1972}
A modification well within []{#calibre_link-1973}the Platonic diagram:
writing of the soul and of the body, writing of the interior and of the
exterior, writing of conscience and of the passions, as there is a voice
of the soul and a voice of the body. "Conscience is the voice of the
soul, the passions are the voice of the body" \[p. 249\]. One must
constantly go back toward the "voice of nature," the "holy voice
of[]{#calibre_link-1974} nature," that merges with the divine
inscription and prescription; one must encounter oneself within it,
enter into a dialogue within its signs, speak and respond to oneself in
its pages.

It was as if nature had spread out all her magnificence in front of our
eyes to offer its text for our consideration. ... I have therefore
closed all the books. Only one is open to all eyes. It is the book
of[]{#calibre_link-1975} Nature. In this great and sublime book I learn
to serve and adore its author.

The good writing has therefore always been *comprehended*. Comprehended
as that which had to be comprehended: within a nature or a natural law,
created or not, but first thought within an eternal presence.
Comprehended, therefore, within a totality, and enveloped in a volume or
a book. The idea of the book is the idea[]{#calibre_link-1976} of a
totality, finite or infinite, of the signifier; this totality of the
signifier cannot be a totality, unless a totality constituted by the
signified preexists it, supervises its inscriptions and its signs, and
is independent of it in its ideality. The idea of the book, which always
refers to a natural totality, is profoundly alien to the sense of
writing. It is the encyclopedic protection of[]{#calibre_link-1977}
theology and of logocentrism against the disruption of writing, against
its aphoristic energy, and, as I shall specify later, against difference
in general. If I distinguish the text from the book, I shall say that
the destruction of the book, as it is now under way in all domains,
denudes the surface of the text. That necessary violence responds to a
violence that was no less necessary.

Written Being/The Being Written

The reassuring evidence within which Western tradition had to organize
itself and must continue to live would therefore be as follows: the
order of the signified is never contemporary, is at best the subtly
discrepant inverse or parallel---discrepant by the time of a
breath---from the order of the signifier. And the sign must be the unity
of a heterogeneity, since the[]{#calibre_link-1979} signified (sense or
thing, noeme or reality) is not in itself a signifier, a *trace:* in any
case is not constituted in its sense by its relationship with a possible
trace. The formal essence of the signified is *presence*, and the
privilege of its proximity to the logos as *phonè* is the privilege of
presence. This is the inevitable response as soon as one asks: "what is
the sign?," that is to say,[]{#calibre_link-1980} when one submits the
sign to the question of essence, to the "ti esti." The "formal essence"
of the sign can only be determined in terms of presence.
[]{#calibre_link-926}One cannot get around that response, except by
challenging the very form of the question and beginning to think that
the sign ![image](images/000004.jpg){.calibre7} that ill-named
![image](images/000008.jpg){.calibre7}[]{#calibre_link-1981}, the only
one, that escapes the instituting question of philosophy: "what
is...?"^[]{#calibre_link-564}[8](#calibre_link-181){.nounder}^

Radicalizing the concepts of *interpretation, perspective, evaluation,
difference*, and all the "empiricist" or nonphilosophical motifs that
have constanty tormented philosophy throughout the history of the West,
and besides, have had nothing but the inevitable weakness of being
produced in the field of philosophy,[]{#calibre_link-1982} Nietzsche,
far from remaining *simply* (with Hegel and as Heidegger wished)
*within* metaphysics, contributed a great deal to the liberation of the
signifier from its dependence or derivation with respect to the logos
and the related concept of truth or the primary signified, in whatever
sense that is understood. Reading, and therefore writing, the text were
for Nietzsche
"originary"^[]{#calibre_link-565}[9](#calibre_link-182){.nounder}^
operations (I[]{#calibre_link-1983} put that word within quotation marks
for reasons to appear later) with regard to a sense that they do not
first have to transcribe or discover, which would not therefore be a
truth signified in the original element and presence of the logos, as
*topos noetos*, divine understanding, or the structure of a priori
necessity. To save Nietzsche from a reading of the Heideggerian type, it
seems that we[]{#calibre_link-1984} must above all not attempt to
restore or make explicit a less naive "ontology," composed of profound
ontological intuitions acceding to some originary truth, an entire
fundamentality hidden under the appearance of an empiricist or
metaphysical text. The virulence of Nietzschean thought could not be
more competely misunderstood. On the contrary, one must *accentuate* the
"naiveté" of a breakthrough[]{#calibre_link-1985} which cannot attempt a
step outside of metaphysics, which cannot *criticize* metaphysics
radically without still utilizing in a certain way, in a certain type or
a certain style of *text*, propostions that, read within the philosophic
corpus, that is to say according to Nietzsche ill-read or unread, have
always been and will always be "naivetés," incoherent signs of an
absolute appurtenance. Therefore,[]{#calibre_link-1986} rather that
protect Nietzsche from the Heideggerian reading, we should perhaps offer
him up to it completely, underwriting that interpretation without
reserve; in a *certain way* and up to the point where, the content of
the Nietzschean discourse being almost lost for the question of being,
its form regains its absolute strangeness, where his text finally
invokes a different type of reading, more[]{#calibre_link-1987} faithful
to his type of writing: Nietzsche has *written what* he has written. He
has written that writing---and first of all his own---is not originarily
subordinate to the logos and to truth. And that this subordination has
*come into being* during an epoch whose meaning we must deconstruct. Now
in this direction (but only in this direction, for read otherwise, the
Nietzschean demolition remains dogmatic[]{#calibre_link-1988} and, like
all reversals, a captive of that metaphysical edifice which it professes
to overthrow. On that point and in that *order of reading*, the
conclusions of []{#calibre_link-149}Heidegger and Fink are irrefutable),
Heideggerian thought would reinstate rather than destroy the instance of
the logos and of the truth of being as "primum signatum:" the
"transcendental" signified ("transcendental" in a certain
sense,[]{#calibre_link-1989} as in the Middle Ages the
transcendental---ens, *unum, verum, bonum*---was said to be the "primum
cognitum") implied by all categories or all determined significations,
by all lexicons and all syntax, and therefore by all linguistic
signifiers, though not to be identified simply with any one of those
signifiers, allowing itself to be precomprehended through each of them,
remaining irreducible to all[]{#calibre_link-1990} the epochal
determinations that it nonetheless makes possible, thus opening the
history of the logos, yet itself being only through the logos; that is,
*being nothing* before the logos and outside of it. The logos *of*
being, "Thought obeying the Voice of
Being,"^[]{#calibre_link-566}[10](#calibre_link-183){.nounder}^ is the
first and the last resource of the sign, of the difference between
*signans* and *signatum*. There has to be a transcendental
signified[]{#calibre_link-1991} for the difference between signifier and
signified to be somewhere absolute and irreducible. It is not by chance
that the thought of being, as the thought of this transcendental
signified, is manifested above all in the voice: in a language of words
\[*mots*\]. The voice *is heard* (understood)---that undoubtedly is what
is called conscience---closest to the self as the absolute effacement of
the signifier:[]{#calibre_link-1992} pure auto-affection that
necessarily has the form of time and which does not borrow from outside
of itself, in the world or in "reality," any accessory signifier, any
substance of expression foreign to its own spontaneity. It is the unique
experience of the signified producing itself spontaneously, from within
the self, and nevertheless, as signified concept, in the element of
ideality or universality.[]{#calibre_link-1993} The unworldly character
of this substance of expression is constitutive of this ideality. This
experience of the effacement of the signifier in the voice is not merely
one illusion among many---since it is the condition of the very idea of
truth---but I shall elsewhere show in what it does delude itself. This
illusion is the history of truth and it cannot be dissipated so quickly.
Within the[]{#calibre_link-1994} closure of this experience, the word
*\[mot\] is* lived as the elementary and undecomposable unity of the
signified and the voice, of the concept and a transparent substance of
expression. This experience is considered in its greatest purity---and
at the same time in the condition of its possibility---as the experience
of "being." The word "being," or at any rate the words designating the
sense of being[]{#calibre_link-1995} in different languages, is, with
some others, an "originary word"
(*"Urwort"*),^[]{#calibre_link-567}[11](#calibre_link-184){.nounder}^
the transcendental word assuring the possibility of being-word to all
other words. As such, it is precomprehended in all language and---this
is the opening of *Being and Time*---only this precomprehension would
permit the opening of the question of the sense of being in general,
beyond all regional ontologies and all
metaphysics:[]{#calibre_link-1996} a question that broaches philosophy
(for example, in the *Sophist*) and lets itself []{#calibre_link-950}be
taken over by philosophy, a question that Heidegger repeats by
submitting the history of metaphysics to it. Heidegger reminds us
constantly that the sense of being is neither the word "being" nor the
concept of being. But as that sense is nothing outside of language and
the language of words, it is tied, if not[]{#calibre_link-1997} to a
particular word or to a particular system of language (concesso non
dato), at least to the possibility of the word in general. And to the
possibility of its irreducible simplicity. One could thus think that it
remains only to choose between two possibilities. (1) Does a modern
linguistics, a science of signification breaking the unity of the word
and breaking with its alleged irreducibility,[]{#calibre_link-1998}
still have anything to do with "language?" Heidegger would probably
doubt it. (2) Conversely, is not all that is profoundly meditated as the
thought or the question of being enclosed within an old linguistics of
the word which one practices here unknowingly? Unknowingly because such
a linguistics, whether spontaneous or systematic, has always had to
share the presuppositions of metaphysics. The[]{#calibre_link-1999} two
operate on the same grounds.

It goes without saying that the alternatives cannot be so simple.

On the one hand, if modern linguistics remains completely enclosed
within a classical conceptuality, if especially it naively uses the word
*being* and all that it presupposes, that which, within this
linguistics, deconstructs the unity of the word in general can no
longer, according to the model[]{#calibre_link-2000} of the Heideggerian
question, as it functions powerfully from the very opening of *Being and
Time*, be circumscribed as ontic science or regional ontology. In as
much as the question of being unites indissolubly with the
precomprehension of the *word being*, without being reduced to it, the
linguistics that works for the deconstruction of the constituted unity
of that word has only, in fact or in[]{#calibre_link-2001} principle, to
have the question of being posed in order to define its field and the
order of its dependence.

Not only is its field no longer simply ontic, but the limits of ontology
that correspond to it no longer have anything regional about them. And
can what I say here of linguistics, or at least of a certain work that
may be undertaken within it and thanks to it, not be said of all
research[]{#calibre_link-2002} *in as much as and to the strict extent
that* it would finally deconstitute the founding concept-words of
ontology, of being in its privilege? Outside of linguistics, it is in
psychoanalytic research that this breakthrough seems at present to have
the greatest likelihood of being expanded.

Within the strictly limited space of this breakthrough, these "sciences"
are no longer *dominated* by the questions[]{#calibre_link-2003} of a
transcendental phenomenology or a fundamental ontology. One may perhaps
say, following the order of questions inaugurated by *Being and Time*
and radicalizing the questions of Husserlian phenomenology, that this
breakthrough does []{#calibre_link-952}not belong to science itself,
that what thus seems to be produced within an ontic field or within a
regional ontology, does not belong to them by rights and
leads[]{#calibre_link-2004} back to the question of being itself.

Because it is indeed the *question* of being that Heidegger asks
metaphysics. And with it the question of truth, of sense, of the logos.
The incessant meditation upon that question does not restore confidence.
On the contrary, it dislodges the confidence at its own depth, which,
being a matter of the meaning of being, is more difficult than is often
believed.[]{#calibre_link-2005} In examining the state just before all
determinations of being, destroying the securities of onto-theology,
such a meditation contributes, quite as much as the most contemporary
linguistics, to the dislocation of the unity of the sense of being, that
is, in the last instance, the unity of the word.

It is thus that, after evoking the "voice of being," Heidegger recalls
that it is silent, mute,[]{#calibre_link-2006} insonorous, wordless,
originarily *a-phonic (die Gewähr der lautlosen Stimme verborgener
Quellen ...*). The voice of the sources is not heard. A rupture between
the originary meaning of being and the word, between meaning and the
voice, between "the voice of being" and the *"phonè,"* between "the call
of being," and articulated sound; such a rupture, which at once confirms
a fundamental metaphor, and[]{#calibre_link-2007} renders it suspect by
accentuating its metaphoric discrepancy, translates the ambiguity of the
Heideggerian situation with respect to the metaphysics of presence and
logocentrism. It is at once contained within it and transgresses it. But
it is impossible to separate the two. The very movement of transgression
sometimes holds it back short of the limit. In opposition to what we
suggested above,[]{#calibre_link-2008} it must be remembered that, for
Heidegger, the sense of being is never simply and rigorously a
"signified." It is not by chance that that word is not used; that means
that being escapes the movement of the sign, a proposition that can
equally well be understood as a repetition of the classical tradition
and as a caution with respect to a technical or metaphysical theory of
signification. On the other[]{#calibre_link-2009} hand, the sense of
being is literally neither "primary," nor "fundamental," nor
"transcendental," whether understood in the scholastic, Kantian, or
Husserlian sense. The restoration of being as "transcending" the
categories of the entity, the opening of the fundamental ontology, are
nothing but necessary yet provisional moments. From *The Introduction to
Metaphysics* onward, Heidegger renounces[]{#calibre_link-2010} the
project of and the word
ontology.^[]{#calibre_link-568}[12](#calibre_link-185){.nounder}^ The
necessary, originary, and irreducible dissimulation of the meaning of
being, its occultation within the very blossoming forth of presence,
that retreat without which there would be no history of being which was
completely *history* and history of *being*, Heidegger's insistence on
noting that being is produced as history only through the logos, and is
nothing[]{#calibre_link-2011} outside of it, the difference between
being and the entity---all this clearly indicates that fundamentally
nothing escapes the movement of the signifier []{#calibre_link-951}and
that, in the last instance, the difference between signified and
signifier *is nothing*. This proposition of transgression, not yet
integrated into a careful discourse, runs the risk of formulating
regression itself. One must therefore go *by way[]{#calibre_link-2012}
of* the question of being as it is directed by Heidegger and by him
alone, at and beyond onto-theology, in order to reach the rigorous
thought of that strange nondifference and in order to determine it
correctly. Heidegger occasionally reminds us that "being," as it is
fixed in its general syntactic and lexicological forms within
linguistics and Western philosophy, is not a primary and
absolutely[]{#calibre_link-2013} irreducible signified, that it is still
rooted in a system of languages and an historically determined
"significance," although strangely privileged as the virtue of
disclosure and dissimulation; particularly when he invites us to
meditate on the "privilege" of the "third person singular of the present
indicative" and the "infinitive." Western metaphysics, as the limitation
of the sense of being[]{#calibre_link-2014} within the field of
presence, is produced as the domination of a linguistic
form.^[]{#calibre_link-569}[13](#calibre_link-186){.nounder}^ To
question the origin of that domination does not amount to hypostatizing
a transcendental signified, but to a questioning of what constitutes our
history and what produced transcendentality itself. Heidegger brings it
up also when in *Zur Seinsfrage*, for the same reason, he lets the word
"being" be read only if[]{#calibre_link-2015} it is crossed out
(*kreuzweise Durchstreichung*). That mark of deletion is not, however, a
"merely negative symbol" (p. 31) \[p. 83\]. That deletion is the final
writing of an epoch. Under its strokes the presence of a transcendental
signified is effaced while still remaining legible. Is effaced while
still remaining legible, is destroyed while making visible the very idea
of the sign. In as much[]{#calibre_link-2016} as it de-limits
onto-theology, the metaphysics of presence and logocentrism, this last
writing is also the first writing.

To come to recognize, not within but on the horizon of the Heideggerian
paths, and yet in them, that the sense of being is not a transcendental
or trans-epochal signified (even if it was always dissimulated within
the epoch) but already, in a truly *unheard of* sense, a
determined[]{#calibre_link-2017} signifying trace, is to affirm that
within the decisive concept of ontico-ontological difference, *all is
not to be thought at one go;* entity and being, ontic and ontological,
"ontico-ontological," are, in an original style, *derivative* with
regard to difference; and with respect to what I shall later call
*differance*, an economic concept designating the production of
differing/deferring. The ontico-ontological[]{#calibre_link-2018}
difference and its ground (*Grand*) in the "transcendence of Dasein"
(*Vom Wesen des Grundes* \[Frankfurt am Main, 1955\], p. 16 \[p. 29\])
are not absolutely originary. Differance by itself would be more
"originary," but one would no longer be able to call it "origin" or
"ground," those notions belonging essentially to the history of
onto-theology, to the system functioning as the effacing of
difference.[]{#calibre_link-2019} It can, however, be thought of in the
closest proximity to itself only on []{#calibre_link-938}one condition:
that one begins by determining it as the ontico-ontological difference
before erasing that determination. The necessity of passing through that
erased determination, the necessity of that *trick of writing* is
irreducible. An unemphatic and difficult thought that, through much
unperceived mediation, must carry[]{#calibre_link-2020} the entire
burden of our question, a question that I shall provisionally call
*historial \[historiale\]*. It is with its help that I shall later be
able to attempt to relate differance and writing.

The hestitation of these thoughts (here Nietzsche's and Heidegger's) is
not an "incoherence": it is a trembling proper to all post-Hegelian
attempts and to this passage between two epochs. The
movements[]{#calibre_link-2021} of deconstruction do not destroy
structures from the outside. They are not possible and effective, nor
can they take accurate aim, except by inhabiting those structures.
Inhabiting them *in a certain way*, because one always inhabits, and all
the more when one does not suspect it. Operating necessarily from the
inside, borrowing all the strategic and economic resources of subversion
from the old[]{#calibre_link-2022} structure, borrowing them
structurally, that is to say without being able to isolate their
elements and atoms, the enterprise of deconstruction always in a certain
way falls prey to its own work. This is what the person who has begun
the same work in another area of the same habitation does not fail to
point out with zeal. No exercise is more widespread today and one should
be able to formalize its[]{#calibre_link-2023} rules.

Hegel was already caught up in this game. *On the one hand*, he
undoubtedly *summed up* the entire philosophy of the logos. He
determined ontology as absolute logic; he assembled all the
delimitations of philosophy as presence; he assigned to presence the
eschatology of parousia, of the self-proximity of infinite subjectivity.
And for the same reason he had to debase or subordinate
writing.[]{#calibre_link-2024} When he criticizes the Leibnizian
characteristic, the formalism of the understanding, and mathematical
symbolism, he makes the same gesture: denouncing the
being-outside-of-itself of the logos in the sensible or the intellectual
abstraction. Writing is that forgetting of the self, that
exteriorization, the contrary of the interiorizing memory, of the
*Erinnerung* that opens the history of the spirit.[]{#calibre_link-2025}
It is this that the *Phaedrus* said: writing is at once mnemotechnique
and the power of forgetting. Naturally, the Hegelian critique of writing
stops at the alphabet. As phonetic writing, the alphabet is at the same
time more servile, more contemptible, more secondary ("alphabetic
writing expresses *sounds* which are themselves signs. It consists
therefore of the signs of signs *\['aus Zeichen der
Zeichen',"[]{#calibre_link-2026} Enzyklopädie*, §
459\])[]{#calibre_link-1124}[\*](#calibre_link-187){.nounder} but it is
also the best writing, the mind's writing; its effacement before the
voice, that in it which respects the ideal interiority of phonic
signifiers, all that by which it sublimates []{#calibre_link-989}space
and sight, all that makes of it the writing of history, the writing,
that is, of the infinite spirit relating to itself in its discourse and
its culture:

It follows that to learn[]{#calibre_link-2027} to read and write an
alphabetic writing should be regarded as a means to infinite culture
(*unendliches Bildungsmittel*) that is not enough appreciated; because
thus the mind, distancing itself from the concrete sense-perceptible,
directs its attention on the more formal moment, the sonorous word and
its abstract elements, and contributes essentially to the founding and
purifying of the ground of[]{#calibre_link-2028} interiority within the
subject.

In that sense it is the *Aufhebung* of other writings, particularly of
hieroglyphic script and of the Leibnizian characteristic that had been
criticized previously through one and the same gesture. (*Aufhebung* is,
more or less implicitly, the dominant concept of nearly all histories of
writing, even today. It is *the* concept of history and of teleology.)
In fact, Hegel[]{#calibre_link-2029} continues: "Acquired habit later
also suppresses the specificity of alphabetic writing, which consists in
seeming to be, in the interest of sight, a detour \[*Umweg*\] through
hearing to arrive at representations, and makes it into a hieroglyphic
script for us, such that in using it, we do not need to have present to
our consciousness the mediation of sounds."

It is on this condition that Hegel subscribes[]{#calibre_link-2030} to
the Leibnizian praise of nonphonetic writing. It can be produced by deaf
mutes, Leibniz had said. Hegel:

Beside the fact that, by the practice which transforms this alphabetic
script into hieroglyphics, the aptitude for abstraction acquired through
such an exercise *is conserved* \[italics added\], the reading of
hieroglyphs is for itself a deaf reading and a mute writing (*ein taubes
Lesen und[]{#calibre_link-2031} ein stummes Schreiben*). What is audible
or temporal, visible or spatial, has each its proper basis and in the
first place they are of equal value; but in alphabetic script there is
only *one* basis and that following a specific relation, namely, that
the visible language is related only as a sign to the audible language;
intelligence expresses itself immediately and unconditionally through
speech[]{#calibre_link-2032} (ibid.).

What writing itself, in its nonphonetic moment, betrays, is life. It
menaces at once the breath, the spirit, and history as the spirit's
relationship with itself. It is their end, their finitude, their
paralysis. Cutting breath short, sterilizing or immobilizing spiritual
creation in the repetition of the letter, in the commentary or the
*exegesis*, confined in a narrow space, reserved[]{#calibre_link-2033}
for a minority, it is the principle of death and of difference in the
becoming of being. It is to speech what China is to Europe: "It is only
to the
exegeticism^[]{#calibre_link-570}[14](#calibre_link-188){.nounder}^ of
Chinese spiritual culture that their hieroglyphic writing is suited.
This type of writing is, besides, the part reserved for a very small
section of a people, the section that possesses the exclusive domain
[]{#calibre_link-990}of spiritual culture. ...[]{#calibre_link-2034} A
hieroglyphic script would require a philosophy as exegetical as Chinese
culture generally is" (ibid.).

If the nonphonetic moment menaces the history and the life of the spirit
as self-presence in the breath, it is because it menaces substantiality,
that other metaphysical name of presence and of *ousia*. First in the
form of the substantive. Nonphonetic writing breaks the noun apart. It
describes[]{#calibre_link-2035} relations and not appellations. The noun
and the word, those unities of breath and concept, are effaced within
pure writing. In that regard, Leibniz is as disturbing as the Chinese in
Europe: "This situation, the analytic notation of representations in
hieroglyphic script, which seduced Leibniz to the point of wrongly
preferring this script to the alphabetic, rather contradicts the
fundamental[]{#calibre_link-2036} exigency of language in general,
namely the noun. ... All difference *\[Abweichung\]* in analysis would
produce another formation of the written substantive."

The horizon of absolute knowledge is the effacement of writing in the
logos, the retrieval of the trace in parousia, the reappropriation of
difference, the accomplishment of what I have elsewhere
called^[]{#calibre_link-571}[15](#calibre_link-189){.nounder}^ the
*metaphysics of the proper \[le
propre*[]{#calibre_link-2037}---self-possession, propriety, property,
cleanliness\].

Yet, all that Hegel thought within this horizon, all, that is, except
eschatology, may be reread as a meditation on writing. Hegel is *also*
the thinker of irreducible difference. He rehabilitated thought as the
*memory productive* of signs. And he reintroduced, as I shall try to
show elsewhere, the essential necessity of the written trace in
a[]{#calibre_link-2038} philosophical---that is to say
Socratic---discourse that had always believed it possible to do without
it; the last philosopher of the book and the first thinker of writing.

### []{#calibre_link-973 .calibre3}**2 *Linguistics and Grammatology*** {#calibre_link-14 .h2}

***Writing is nothing but the representation of speech; it is bizarre
that one gives more care to the determining of the image than to the
object*.---***J.-J. Rousseau*, Fragment inédit d'un essai sur les
langues

The concept of writing should define the field of a science. But can it
be determined by scholars outside of all the historico-metaphysical
predeterminations that[]{#calibre_link-2041} we have just situated so
clinically? What can a science of writing begin to signify, if it is
granted:

1\) that the very idea of science was born in a certain epoch of
writing;

2\) that it was thought and formulated, as task, idea, project, in a
language implying a certain kind of structurally and axiologically
determined relationship between speech and writing;

3\) that, to that extent, it was[]{#calibre_link-2042} first related to
the concept and the adventure of phonetic writing, valorized as the
telos of all writing, even though what was always the exemplary model of
scientificity---mathematics---constantly moved away from that goal;

4\) that the strictest notion of a *general science of writing* was
born, for nonfortuitous reasons, during a certain period of the world's
history (beginning around the eighteenth[]{#calibre_link-2043} century)
and within a certain determined system of relationships between "living"
speech and inscription;

5\) that writing is not only an auxiliary means in the service of
science---and possibly its object---but first, as Husserl in particular
pointed out in *The Origin of Geometry*, the condition of the
possibility of ideal objects and therefore of scientific objectivity.
Before being its object, writing[]{#calibre_link-2044} is the condition
of the *epistémè*.

6\) that historicity itself is tied to the possibility of writing;to the
possibility of writing in general, beyond those particular forms of
writing in the name of which we have long spoken of peoples without
writing and without history. Before being the object of a history---of
an historical science-writing opens the field of history---of historical
becoming. And[]{#calibre_link-2045} the former (*Historie* in German)
presupposes the latter (*Geschichte*).

The science of writing should therefore look for its object at the roots
of scientificity. The history of writing should turn back toward the
origin of historicity. A science of the possibility of science? A
science of science []{#calibre_link-2046}which would no longer have the
form of *logic* but that of *grammatics?* A history of the possibility
of[]{#calibre_link-2047} history which would no longer be an
archaeology, a philosophy of history or a history of philosophy?

The *positive* and the classical sciences of writing are obliged to
repress this sort of question. Up to a certain point, such repression is
even necessary to the progress of positive investigation. Beside the
fact that it would still be held within a philosophizing logic, the
ontophenomenological[]{#calibre_link-2048} question of essence, that is
to say of the origin of writing, could, by itself, only paralyze or
sterilize the typological or historical research of *facts*.

My intention, therefore, is not to weigh that prejudicial question, that
dry, necessary, and somewhat facile question of right, against the power
and efficacy of the positive researches which we may witness today. The
genesis and system of[]{#calibre_link-2049} scripts had never led to
such profound, extended, and assured explorations. It is not really a
matter of weighing the question against the importance of the discovery;
since the questions are imponderable, they cannot be weighed. If the
issue is not quite that, it is perhaps because its repression has real
consequences in the very content of the researches that, in the present
case and in a privileged[]{#calibre_link-2050} way, are always arranged
around problems of definition and beginning.

The grammatologist least of all can avoid questioning himself about the
essence of his object in the form of a question of origin: "What is
writing?" means "where and when does writing begin?" The responses
generally come very quickly. They circulate within concepts that are
seldom criticized and move within evidence which[]{#calibre_link-2051}
always seems self-evident. It is around these responses that a typology
of and a perspective on the growth of writing are always organized. All
works dealing with the history of writing are composed along the same
lines: a philosophical and teleological classification exhausts the
critical problems in a few pages; one passes next to an exposition of
facts. We have a contrast between the theoretical[]{#calibre_link-2052}
fragility of the reconstructions and the historical, archeological,
ethnological, philosophical wealth of information.

The question of the origin of writing and the question of the origin of
language are difficult to separate. Grammatologists, who are generally
by training historians, epigraphists, and archeologists, seldom relate
their researches to the modern science of language. It is
all[]{#calibre_link-2053} the more surprising that, among the "sciences
of man," linguistics is the one science whose scientificity is given as
an example with a zealous and insistent unanimity.

Has grammatology, then, the right to expect from linguistics an
essential assistance that it has almost never looked for? On the
contrary, does one not find efficaciously at work, in the very movement
by which linguistics is instituted[]{#calibre_link-2054} as a science, a
metaphysical presupposition about the relationship between speech and
writing? Would that presupposition not hinder the constitution of a
general science of writing? Is not the lifting of
[]{#calibre_link-818}that presupposition an overthrowing of the
landscape upon which the science of language is peacefully installed?
For better and for worse? For blindness as well as for productivity?
This is the[]{#calibre_link-2055} second type of question that I now
wish to outline. To develop this question, I should like to approach, as
a privileged example, the project and texts of Ferdinand de Saussure.
That the particularity of the example does not interfere with the
generality of my argument is a point which I shall occasionally try not
merely to take for granted.

Linguistics thus wishes to be the science of
language.[]{#calibre_link-2056} Let us set aside all the implicit
decisions that have established such a project and all the questions
about its own origin that the fecundity of this science allows to remain
dormant. Let us first simply consider that the scientificity of that
science is often acknowledged because of its *phonological* foundations.
Phonology, it is often said today, communicates its scientificity to
linguistics,[]{#calibre_link-2057} which in turn serves as the
epistemological model for all the sciences of man. Since the deliberate
and systematic phonological orientation of linguistics (Troubetzkoy,
Jakobson, Martinet) carries out an intention which was originally
Saussure's, I shall, at least provisionally, confine myself to the
latter. Will my argument be equally applicable a fortiori to the most
accentuated forms of phonologism?[]{#calibre_link-2058} The problem will
at least be stated.

The science of linguistics determines language---its field of
objectivity---in the last instance and in the irreducible simplicity of
its essence, as the unity of the *phonè*, the *glossa*, and the *logos*.
This determination is by rights anterior to all the eventual
differentiations that could arise within the systems of terminology of
the different schools (language/speech[]{#calibre_link-2059}
*\[langue/parole\];* code/message; scheme/usage; linguistic/logic;
phonology/phonematics/phonetics/glossematics). And even if one wished to
keep sonority on the side of the sensible and contingent signifier
(which would be strictly speaking impossible, since formal identities
isolated within a sensible mass are already idealities that are not
purely sensible), it would have to be admitted that
the[]{#calibre_link-2060} immediate and privileged unity which founds
significance and the acts of language is the articulated unity of sound
and sense within the phonie. With regard to this unity, writing would
always be derivative, accidental, particular, exterior, doubling the
signifier: phonetic. "Sign of a sign," said Aristotle, Rousseau, and
Hegel.

Yet, the intention that institutes general linguistics as a
science[]{#calibre_link-2061} remains in this respect within a
contradiction. Its declared purpose indeed confirms, saying what goes
without saying, the subordination of grammatology, the
historico-metaphysical reduction of writing to the rank of an instrument
enslaved to a full and originarily spoken language. But another gesture
(not another statement of purpose, for here what does not go without
saying is done without being[]{#calibre_link-2062} said, written without
being []{#calibre_link-822}uttered) liberates the future of a general
grammatology of which linguistics-phonology would be only a dependent
and circumscribed area. Let us follow this tension between gesture and
statement in Saussure.

#### ***The Outside and the Inside[]{#calibre_link-1126}[\*](#calibre_link-191){.nounder}*** {#calibre_link-15 .h3}

On the one hand, true to the Western tradition that controls not only in
theory but in practice (*in the principle of its practice*)
the[]{#calibre_link-2063} relationships between speech and writing,
Saussure does not recognize in the latter more than a *narrow* and
*derivative* function. Narrow because it is nothing but one modality
among others, a modality of the events which can befall a language whose
essence, as the facts seem to show, can remain forever uncontaminated by
writing. "Language does have an ... oral tradition that is independent
of writing"[]{#calibre_link-2064} (*Cours de linguistique générale*, p.
46). Derivative because *representative:* signifier of the first
signifier, representation of the self-present voice, of the immediate,
natural, and direct signification of the meaning (of the signified, of
the concept, of the ideal object or what have you). Saussure takes up
the traditional definition of writing which, already in Plato and
Aristotle, was restricted[]{#calibre_link-2065} to the model of phonetic
script and the language of words. Let us recall the Aristotelian
definition: "Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience and
written words are the symbols of spoken words." Saussure: "Language and
writing are two distinct systems of signs; the second *exists for the
sole purpose of representing* the first" (p. 45; italics added) \[p.
23[]{#calibre_link-1127}[†](#calibre_link-192){.nounder}\]. This
representative determination,[]{#calibre_link-2066} beside communicating
without a doubt essentially with the idea of the sign, does not
translate a choice or an evaluation, does not betray a psychological or
metaphysical presupposition peculiar to Saussure; it describes or rather
reflects the structure of a certain type of writing: phonetic writing,
which we use and within whose element the *epistémè* in general (science
and philosophy), and linguistics[]{#calibre_link-2067} in particular,
could be founded. One should, moreover, say *model* rather than
*structure;* it is not a question of a system constructed and
functioning perfectly, but of an ideal explicitly directing a
functioning which *in fact* is never completely phonetic. In fact, but
also for reasons of essence to which I shall frequently return.

To be sure this factum of phonetic writing is massive; it
commands[]{#calibre_link-2068} our entire culture and our entire
science, and it is certainly not just one fact
[]{#calibre_link-145}among others. Nevertheless it does not respond to
any necessity of an absolute and universal essence. Using this as a
point of departure, Saussure defines the project and object of general
linguistics: "The linguistic object is not defined by the combination of
the written word and the spoken word: *the spoken
form[]{#calibre_link-2069} alone constitutes the object"* (p. 45;
italics added) \[pp. 23--24\].

The form of the question to which he responded thus entailed the
response. It was a matter of knowing what sort of *word* is the object
of linguistics and what the relationships are between the atomic unities
that are the written and the spoken word. Now the word (*vox*) is
already a unity of sense and sound, of concept and
voice,[]{#calibre_link-2070} or, to speak a more rigorously Saussurian
language, of the signified and the signifier. This last terminology was
moreover first proposed in the domain of spoken language alone, of
linguistics in the narrow sense and not in the domain of semiology ("I
propose to retain the word *sign* \[*signe*\] to designate the whole and
to replace *concept* and *sound-image* respectively by *signified
\[signifié\]* and *[]{#calibre_link-2071}signifier \[signifiant\]"* p.
99 \[p. 67\]). The *word* is thus already a constituted unity, an effect
of "the somewhat mysterious fact... that 'thought-sound' implies
divisions" (p. 156) \[p. 112\]. Even if the word is in its turn
articulated, even if it implies other divisions, as long as one poses
the question of the relationships between speech and writing in the
light of the indivisible units of the[]{#calibre_link-2072}
"thought-sound," there will always be the ready response. Writing will
be "phonetic," it will be the outside, the exterior representation of
language and of this "thought-sound." It must necessarily operate from
already constituted units of signification, in the formation of which it
has played no part.

Perhaps the objection will be made that writing up to the present has
not only not contradicted,[]{#calibre_link-2073} but indeed confirmed
the linguistics of the word. Hitherto I seem to have maintained that
only the fascination of the unit called *word* has prevented giving to
writing the attention that it merited. By that I seemed to suppose that,
by ceasing to accord an absolute privilege to the word, modern
linguistics would become that much more attentive to writing and would
finally cease to regard it with[]{#calibre_link-2074} suspicion. André
Martinet comes to the opposite conclusion. In his study "The
Word,"^[]{#calibre_link-572}[1](#calibre_link-193){.nounder}^ he
describes the necessity that contemporary linguistics obeys when it is
led, if not to dispense everywhere with the concept of the word, at
least to make its usage more flexible, to associate it with the concepts
of smaller or greater units (monemes or syntagms). In accrediting and
consolidating the division[]{#calibre_link-2075} of language into words
in certain areas of linguistics, writing would thus have encouraged
classical linguistics in its prejudices. Writing would have constructed
or at least condensed the "screen of the word."

[]{#calibre_link-134}What a contemporary linguist can say of the word
well illustrates the general revision of traditional concepts that the
functionalist and structuralist research of the last
thirty-five[]{#calibre_link-2076} years had to undertake in order to
give a scientific basis to the observation and description of languages.
Certain applications of linguistics, like the researches relating to
mechanical translation, by the emphasis they place on the written form
of language, could make us believe in the fundamental importance of the
divisions of the written text and make us forget that one must always
start with[]{#calibre_link-2077} the oral utterance in order to
understand the real nature of human language. Also it is more than ever
indispensable to insist on the necessity of pushing the examination
beyond the immediate appearances and the structures most familiar to the
researcher. It is behind the screen of the word that the truly
fundamental characteristics of human language often appear.

One cannot but subscribe to[]{#calibre_link-2078} this caution. Yet it
must always be recognized that it throws suspicion only on a certain
type of writing: phonetic writing conforming to the empirically
determined and practiced divisions of ordinary oral language. The
processes of mechanical translation to which it alludes conform
similarly to that spontaneous practice. Beyond that model and that
concept of writing, this entire demonstration
must,[]{#calibre_link-2079} it seems, be reconsidered. For it remains
trapped in the Saussurian limitation that we are attempting to explore.

In effect Saussure limits the number of systems of writing to two, both
defined as system of representation of the oral language, either
representing *words* in a synthetic and global manner, or representing
*phonetically* the elements of sounds constituting words:

There are only two[]{#calibre_link-2080} systems of writing: 1) In an
ideographic system each word is represented by a single sign that is
unrelated to the component sounds of the word itself. Each written sign
stands for a whole word and, indirectly, for the idea expressed by the
word. The classic example of an ideographic system of writing is
Chinese. 2) The system commonly known as "phonetic" tries to reproduce
the succession of sounds[]{#calibre_link-2081} that make up a word.
Phonetic systems are sometimes syllabic, sometimes alphabetic, i.e.,
based on the irreducible elements of speech. Moreover, ideographic
systems freely become mixtures when certain ideograms lose their
original value and become symbols of isolated sounds, (p. 47) \[pp.
25--26\]

This limitation is at bottom justified, in Saussure's eyes, by the
notion of the arbitrariness of the[]{#calibre_link-2082} sign. Writing
being defined as "a system of signs," there is no "symbolic" writing (in
the Saussurian sense), no figurative writing; there is no *writing* as
long as graphism keeps a relationship of natural figuration and of some
resemblance to what is then not *signified* but represented, drawn, etc.
The concept of pictographic or natural writing would therefore be
contradictory for Saussure. If[]{#calibre_link-2083} one considers the
now recognized fragility of the notions of pictogram, ideogram etc., and
the uncertainty of the frontiers between so-called pictographic,
ideographic, []{#calibre_link-1021}and phonetic scripts, one realizes
not only the unwiseness of the Saussurian limitation but the need for
general linguistics to abandon an entire family of concepts inherited
from metaphysics---often through the intermediary of
a[]{#calibre_link-2084} psychology---and clustering around the concept
of arbitrariness. All this refers, beyond the nature/culture opposition,
to a supervening opposition between *physis* and *nomos, physis* and
*techné*, whose ultimate function is perhaps to *derive* historicity;
and, paradoxically, not to recognize the rights of history, production,
institutions etc., except in the form of the arbitrary and in the
substance[]{#calibre_link-2085} of naturalism. But let us keep that
question provisionally open: perhaps this gesture, which in truth
presides over metaphysics, is also inscribed in the concept of history
and even in the concept of time.

In addition, Saussure introduces another massive limitation: "I shall
limit discussion to the phonetic system and especially to the one used
today, the system that stems from the Greek
alphabet"[]{#calibre_link-2086} (p. 48) \[p. 26\].

These two limitations are all the more reassuring because they are just
what we need at a specific point to fulfill the most legitimate of
exigencies; in fact, the condition for the scientificity of linguistics
is that the field of linguistics have hard and fast frontiers, that it
be a system regulated by an *internal* necessity, and that in a certain
way its structure be closed.[]{#calibre_link-2087} The representativist
concept of writing facilitates things. If writing is nothing but the
"figuration" (p. 44) \[p. 23\] of the language, one has the right to
exclude it from the interiority of the system (for it must be believed
that there is an *inside* of the language), as the image may be excluded
without damage from the system of reality. Proposing as his theme "the
representation of language[]{#calibre_link-2088} by writing" Saussure
thus begins by positing that writing is "unrelated to \[the\] ... inner
system" of language (p. 44), \[p. 23\]. External/internal,
image/reality, representation/presence, such is the old grid to which is
given the task of outlining the domain of a science. And of what
science? Of a science that can no longer answer to the classical concept
of the *epistém*è because the originality[]{#calibre_link-2089} of its
field---an originality that it inaugurates---is that the opening of the
"image" within it appears as the condition of "reality;" a relationship
that can no longer be thought within the simple difference and the
uncompromising exteriority of "image" and "reality," of "outside" and
"inside," of "appearance" and "essence," with the entire system of
oppositions which necessarily follows from it.
Plato,[]{#calibre_link-2090} who said basically the same thing about the
relationship between writing, speech, and being (or idea), had at least
a more subtle, more critical, and less complacent theory of image,
painting, and imitation than the one that presides over the birth of
Saussurian linguistics.

It is not by chance that the exclusive consideration of phonetic writing
permits a response to the exigencies of the
"internal[]{#calibre_link-2091} system." The basic functional principle
of phonetic writing is precisely to respect and protect
[]{#calibre_link-980}the integrity of the "internal system" of the
language, even if in fact it does not succeed in doing so. *The
Saussurian limitation does not respond, by a mere happy convenience, to
the scientific exigency of the "internal system." That exigency is
itself constituted, as the epistemological
exigency[]{#calibre_link-2092} in general, by the very possibility of
phonetic writing and by the exteriority of the "notation" to internal
logic*.

But let us not simplify: on that point Saussure too is not quite
complacent. Why else would he give so much attention to that external
phenomenon, that exiled figuration, that outside, that double? Why does
he judge it impossible "to simply disregard" \[literally "make
abstraction[]{#calibre_link-2093} of"\] what is nevertheless designated
as the abstract itself with respect to the inside of language? "Writing,
though unrelated to its inner system, is used continually to represent
language. We cannot simply disregard it. We must be acquainted with its
usefulness, shortcomings, and dangers" (p. 44) \[p. 23\].

Writing would thus have the exteriority that one attributes to utensils;
to what is even[]{#calibre_link-2094} an imperfect tool and a dangerous,
almost maleficent, technique. One understands better why, instead of
treating this exterior figuration in an appendix or marginally, Saussure
devotes so laborious a chapter to it almost at the beginning of the
*Course*. It is less a question of outlining than of protecting, and
even of restoring the internal system of the language in the purity of
its concept against[]{#calibre_link-2095} the gravest, most perfidious,
most permanent contamination which has not ceased to menace, even to
corrupt that system, in the course of what Saussure strongly wishes, in
spite of all opposition, to consider as an external history, as a series
of accidents affecting the language and befalling it *from without*, at
the moment of "notation" (p. 45) \[p. 24\], as if writing began and
ended with notation.[]{#calibre_link-2096} Already in the *Phaedrus*,
Plato says that the evil of writing comes from without (275a). The
contamination by writing, the fact or the threat of it, are denounced in
the accents of the moralist or preacher by the linguist from Geneva. The
tone counts; it is as if, at the moment when the modern science of the
logos would come into its autonomy and its scientificity, it became
necessary again to[]{#calibre_link-2097} attack a heresy. This tone
began to make itself heard when, at the moment of already tying the
*epistém*è and the *logos* within the same possibility, the *Phaedrus*
denounced writing as the intrusion of an artful technique, a forced
entry of a totally original sort, an archetypal violence: eruption of
the *outside* within the *inside*, breaching into the interiority of the
soul, the living self-presence[]{#calibre_link-2098} of the soul within
the true logos, the help that speech lends to itself. Thus incensed,
Saussure's vehement argumentation aims at more than a theoretical error,
more than a moral fault: at a sort of stain and primarily at a sin. Sin
has been defined often---among others by Malebranche and by Kant---as
the inversion of the natural relationship between the soul and the body
through passion. Saussure here[]{#calibre_link-2099} points at the
inversion of the natural relationship []{#calibre_link-809}between
speech and writing. It is not a simple analogy: writing, the letter, the
sensible inscription, has always been considered by Western tradition as
the body and matter external to the spirit, to breath, to speech, and to
the logos. And the problem of soul and body is no doubt derived from the
problem of writing from which it
seems---conversely---to[]{#calibre_link-2100} borrow its metaphors.

Writing, sensible matter and artificial exteriority: a "clothing." It
has sometimes been contested that speech clothed thought. Husserl,
Saussure, Lavelle have all questioned it. But has it ever been doubted
that writing was the clothing of speech? For Saussure it is even a
garment of perversion and debauchery, a dress of corruption and
disguise, a festival mask that must[]{#calibre_link-2101} be exorcised,
that is to say warded off, by the good word: "Writing veils the
appearance of language; it is not a guise for language but a disguise"
(p. 51) \[p. 30\]. Strange "image." One already suspects that if writing
is "image" and exterior "figuration," this "representation" is not
innocent. The outside bears with the inside a relationship that is, as
usual, anything but simple exteriority.[]{#calibre_link-2102} The
meaning of the outside was always present within the inside, imprisoned
outside the outside, and vice versa.

Thus a science of language must recover the *natural*---that is, the
simple and original---relationships between speech and writing, that is,
between an inside and an outside. It must restore its absolute youth,
and the purity of its origin, short of a history and a fall which would
have[]{#calibre_link-2103} perverted the relationships between outside
and inside. Therefore there would be a *natural order* of relationships
between linguistic and graphic signs, and it is the theoretician of the
arbitrariness of the sign who reminds us of it. According to the
historico-metaphysical presuppositions evoked above, there would be
first a *natural* bond of sense to the senses and it is this that passes
from sense[]{#calibre_link-2104} to sound: "the natural bond," Saussure
says, "the only true bond, the bond of sound" (p. 46 \[p. 25\]. This
natural bond of the signified (concept or sense) to the phonic signifier
would condition the natural relationship subordinating writing (visible
image) to speech. It is this natural relationship that would have been
inverted by the original sin of writing: "The graphic form *\[image\]*
manages[]{#calibre_link-2105} to force itself upon them at the expense
of sound ... and the natural sequence is reversed" (p. 47) \[p. 25\].
Malebranche explained original sin as inattention, the temptation of
ease and idleness, by that *nothing* that was Adam's "distraction,"
alone culpable before the innocence of the divine word: the latter
exerted no force, no efficacy, since *nothing* had taken place. Here
too, one gave in to *[]{#calibre_link-2106}ease*, which is curiously,
but as usual, on the side of technical artifice and not within the bent
of the natural movement thus thwarted or deviated:

First, the graphic form *\[image\]* of words strikes us as being
something permanent and stable, better suited than sound to constitute
the unity of language throughout time. Though it creates a purely
*fictitious* unity, the *superficial* bond []{#calibre_link-1054}of
writing[]{#calibre_link-2107} is much *easier* to grasp than the natural
bond, the only true bond, the bond of sound (p. 46; italics added) \[p.
25\].

That "the graphic form of words strikes us as being something permanent
and stable, better suited than sound to constitute the unity of language
throughout time," is that not a natural phenomenon too? In fact a bad
nature, "superficial" and "fictitious" and "easy," effaces a
good[]{#calibre_link-2108} nature by imposture; that which ties sense to
sound, the "thought-sound." Saussure is faithful to the tradition that
has always associated writing with the fatal violence of the political
institution. It is clearly a matter, as with Rousseau for example, of a
break with nature, of a usurpation that was coupled with the theoretical
blindness to the natural essence of language, at any rate to
the[]{#calibre_link-2109} natural bond between the "instituted signs" of
the voice and "the first language of man," the "cry of nature" (*Second
Discourse).[]{#calibre_link-1129}[\*](#calibre_link-194){.nounder}*
Saussure: "But the spoken word is so intimately bound to its written
*image* that the latter manages to *usurp* the main role" (p. 45;
italics added) \[p. 24\]. Rousseau: "Writing is nothing but the
representation of speech; it is *bizarre* that one gives more care to
the[]{#calibre_link-2110} determining of the *image* than to the
*object."* Saussure: "Whoever says that a certain letter must be
pronounced a certain way is mistaking the written *image* of a sound for
the sound itself. ... \[One\] attribute\[s\] the oddity *\[bizarrerie\]*
to an exceptional pronunciation" (p. 52) \[p.
30\].^[]{#calibre_link-573}[2](#calibre_link-195){.nounder}^ What is
intolerable and fascinating is indeed the intimacy intertwining image
and thing, *graph, i.e*., and phonè,[]{#calibre_link-2111} to the point
where by a mirroring, inverting, and perverting effect, speech seems in
its turn the speculum of writing, which "manages to usurp the main
role." Representation mingles with what it represents, to the point
where one speaks as one writes, one thinks as if the represented were
nothing more than the shadow or reflection of the representer. A
dangerous promiscuity and a nefarious complicity[]{#calibre_link-2112}
between the reflection and the reflected which lets itself be seduced
narcissistically. In this play of representation, the point of origin
becomes ungraspable. There are things like reflecting pools, and images,
an infinite reference from one to the other, but no longer a source, a
spring. There is no longer a simple origin. For what is reflected is
split *in itself* and not only as an addition[]{#calibre_link-2113} to
itself of its image. The reflection, the image, the double, splits what
it doubles. The origin of the speculation becomes a difference. What can
look at itself *is* not one; and the law of the addition of the origin
to its representation, of the thing to its image, is that one plus one
makes at least three. The []{#calibre_link-851}historical usurpation and
theoretical oddity that install the image within the
rights[]{#calibre_link-2114} of reality are determined as the
*forgetting* of a simple origin. By Rousseau but also for Saussure. The
displacement is hardly anagrammatic: "The result is that people forget
that they learn to speak before they learn to write and the natural
sequence is reversed" (p. 47) \[p. 25\]. The violence of forgetting.
Writing, a mnemotechnic means, supplanting good memory, spontaneous
memory, signifies forgetfulness.[]{#calibre_link-2115} It is exactly
what Plato said in the *Phaedrus*, comparing writing to speech as
*hypomnesis* to *mném*è, the auxilliary aide-mémoire to the living
memory. Forgetfulness because it is a mediation and the departure of the
logos from itself. Without writing, the latter would remain in itself.
Writing is the dissimulation of the natural, primary, and immediate
presence of sense to the soul within the logos.[]{#calibre_link-2116}
Its violence befalls the soul as unconsciousness. Deconstructing this
tradition will therefore not consist of reversing it, of making writing
innocent. Rather of showing why the violence of writing does not
*befall* an innocent language. There is an originary violence of writing
because language is first, in a sense I shall gradually reveal, writing.
"Usurpation" has always already begun. The sense[]{#calibre_link-2117}
of the right side appears in a mythological effect of return.

"The sciences and the arts" have elected to live within this violence,
their "progress" has consecrated forgetfulness and "corrupted manners
*\[moeurs\]."* Saussure again anagrammatizes Rousseau: "The literary
language adds to the undeserved importance of writing... Thus writing
assumes undeserved importance *\[une importance à laquelle
elle[]{#calibre_link-2118} n'a pas droit\]"* (p. 47) \[p. 25\]. When
linguists become embroiled in a theoretical mistake in this subject,
when they are taken in, they are *culpable*, their fault is above all
*moral;* they have yielded to imagination, to sensibility, to passion,
they have fallen into the "trap" (p. 46) \[p. 25\] of writing, have let
themselves be fascinated by the "influence *\[prestige\]* of the written
form" (ibid.),[]{#calibre_link-2119} of that custom, that second nature.
"The language does have a definite and stable oral tradition that is
independent of writing, but the influence *\[prestige\]* of the written
from prevents our seeing this." We are thus not blind to the visible,
but blinded by the visible, dazzled by writing. "The first linguists
confused language and writing, just as the humanists had done before
them. Even Bopp.[]{#calibre_link-2120} ... His immediate successors fell
into the same trap." Rousseau had already addressed the same reproach to
the Grammarians: "For the Grammarians, the art of speech seems to be
very little more than the art of
writing."^[]{#calibre_link-574}[3](#calibre_link-196){.nounder}^ As
usual, the "trap" is artifice dissimulated in nature. This explains why
*The Course in General Linguistics* treats *first* this strange external
system that is writing. As necessary[]{#calibre_link-2121} preamble to
restoring the natural to itself, one must first disassemble the trap. We
read a little further on:

[]{#calibre_link-144}To substitute immediately what is natural for what
is artificial would be necessary; but this is impossible without first
studying the sounds of what is language; detached from their graphic
signs, sounds represent only vague notions, and the prop provided by
writing, though deceptive,[]{#calibre_link-2122} is still preferable.
The first linguists, who knew nothing about the physiology of
articulated sounds, were constantly falling into a trap; to let go of
the letter was for them to lose their foothold; to me, it means a first
step in the direction of truth (p. 55. Opening of the chapter on
Phonology) \[p. 32\].

For Saussure, to give in to the "prestige of the written form" is, as I
have just said,[]{#calibre_link-2123} to give in to *passion*. It is
passion---and I weigh my word---that Saussure analyzes and criticizes
here, as a moralist and a psychologist of a very old tradition. As one
knows, passion is tyrannical and enslaving: "Philological criticism is
still deficient on one point: it follows the written language slavishly
and neglects the living language" (p. 14) \[pp. 1--2\]. "The tyranny of
writing," Saussure[]{#calibre_link-2124} says elsewhere (p. 53) \[p.
31\]. That tyranny is at bottom the mastery of the body over the soul,
and passion is a passivity and sickness of the soul, the moral
perversion is *pathological*. The reciprocal effect of writing on speech
is "wrong *\[vicieuse\],"* Saussure says, "such mistakes are really
pathological" (p. 53) \[p. 31\]. The inversion of the natural
relationships would thus have engendered[]{#calibre_link-2125} the
perverse cult of the letter-image: sin of idolatry, "superstition of the
letter" Saussure says in the
*Anagrams*^[]{#calibre_link-575}[4](#calibre_link-197){.nounder}^ where
he has difficulty in proving the existence of a "phoneme anterior to all
writing." The perversion of artifice engenders monsters. Writing, like
all artificial languages one would wish to fix and remove from the
living history of the natural language, participates in the
monstrosity.[]{#calibre_link-2126} It is a deviation from nature. The
characteristic of the Liebnizian type and Esperanto would be here in the
same position. Saussure's irritation with such possibilities drives him
to pedestrian comparisons: "A man proposing a fixed language that
posterity would have to accept for what it is would be like a hen
hatching a duck's egg" (p. 111) \[p. 76\]. And Saussure wishes to save
not only[]{#calibre_link-2127} the *natural life* of language, but the
natural habits of writing. Spontaneous life must be protected. Thus, the
introduction of scientific exigencies and the taste for exactitude into
ordinary phonetic writing must be avoided. In this case, rationality
would bring death, desolation, and monstrousness. That is why common
orthography must be kept away from the notations of the linguist and
*the multiplying[]{#calibre_link-2128} of diacritical signs must be
avoided:*

Are there grounds for substituting a phonologic alphabet for a system
*\[l'orthographe\]* already in use? Here I can only broach this
interesting subject. I think that phonological writing should be for the
use of linguists only. First, how would it be possible to make the
English, Germans, French, etc. adopt a uniform system! Next, an alphabet
applicable to[]{#calibre_link-2129} all languages would probably be
weighed down by diacritical marks; and---to say nothing of the
distressing []{#calibre_link-1028}appearance of a page of phonological
writing---attempts to gain precision would obviously confuse the reader
by obscuring what the writing was designed to express. The advantages
would not be sufficient to compensate for the inconveniences.
Phonological exactitude is not very desirable
outside[]{#calibre_link-2130} science (p. 57) \[p. 34\].

I hope my intention is clear. I think Saussure's reasons are good. I do
not question, *on the level on which he says it*, the truth of *what
Saussure says* in such a tone. And as long as an explicit problematics,
a *critique* of the relationships between speech and writing, is not
elaborated, what he denounces as the blind prejudice of classical
linguists or of common experience[]{#calibre_link-2131} indeed remains a
blind prejudice, on the basis of a general presupposition which is no
doubt common to the accused and the prosecutor.

I would rather announce the limits and the presuppositions of what seems
here to be self-evident and what seems to me to retain the character and
validity of evidence. The limits have already begun to appear: Why does
a project of *general* linguistics, concerning[]{#calibre_link-2132} the
*internal system in general of language in general*, outline the limits
of its field by excluding, as *exteriority in general*, a *particular*
system of writing, however important it might be, even were it to be *in
fact* universal?^[]{#calibre_link-576}[5](#calibre_link-198){.nounder}^
A particular system which has precisely for its *principle* or at least
for its *declared* project to be exterior to the spoken language.
Declaration of principle, pious[]{#calibre_link-2133} wish and
historical violence of a speech dreaming its full self-presence, living
itself as its own resumption; self-proclaimed language, auto-production
of a speech declared alive, capable, Socrates said, of helping itself, a
logos which believes itself to be its own father, being lifted thus
above written discourse, *infans* (speechless) and infirm at not being
able to respond when one questions[]{#calibre_link-2134} it and which,
since its "parent\['s help\] is \[always\] needed" (toū patrōs áeī
deītai boīthoū---*Phaedrus 275d*) must therefore be born out of a
primary gap and a primary *expatriation*, condemning it to wandering and
blindness, to mourning. Self-proclaimed language but actually speech,
deluded into believing itself completely alive, and violent, for it is
not "capable of protect\[ing\] or defend\[ing\]
\[itself\]"[]{#calibre_link-2135} (dunatōs mēn amūnai éauto) except
through expelling the other, and especially *its own* other, throwing it
*outside* and *below*, under the name of writing. But however important
it might be, and were it in fact universal or called upon to become so,
that particular model which is phonetic writing *does not exist;* no
practice is ever totally faithful to its principle. Even before
speaking, as I shall[]{#calibre_link-2136} do further on, of a radical
and a priori necessary infidelity, one can already remark its massive
phenomena in mathematical script or in punctuation, in *spacing* in
general, which it is difficult to consider as simple accessories of
writing. That a speech supposedly alive can lend itself to spacing in
its own writing is what relates it originarily to its own death.

Finally, the "usurpation" of[]{#calibre_link-2137} which Saussure
speaks, the violence by []{#calibre_link-965}which writing would
substitute itself for its own origin, for that which ought not only to
have engendered it but to have been engendered from itself---such a
reversal of power cannot be an accidental aberration. Usurpation
necessarily refers us to a profound possibility of essence. This is
without a doubt inscribed within speech itself and he should have
questioned[]{#calibre_link-2138} it, perhaps even started from it.

Saussure confronts the system of the spoken language with the system of
phonetic (and even alphabetic) writing as though with the telos of
writing. This teleology leads to the interpretation of all eruptions of
the nonphonetic within writing as transitory crisis and accident of
passage, and it is right to consider this teleology to be a Western
ethnocentrism,[]{#calibre_link-2139} a premathematical primitivism, and
a preformalist intuitionism. Even if this teleology responds to some
absolute necessity, it should be problematized as such. The scandal of
"usurpation" invites us expressly and intrinsically to do that. How was
the trap and the usurpation possible? Saussure never replies to this
question beyond a psychology of the passions or of the imagination; a
psychology reduced[]{#calibre_link-2140} to its most conventional
diagrams. This best explains why all linguistics, a determined sector
inside semiology, is placed under the authority and superiority of
psychology: "To determine the exact place of semiology is the task of
the psychologist" (p. 33) \[p. 16\]. The affirmation of the essential
and "natural" bond between the *phon*è and the sense, the privilege
accorded to an order of signifier[]{#calibre_link-2141} (which then
becomes the major signified of all other signifiers) depend expressly,
and in contradiction to the other levels of the Saussurian discourse,
upon a psychology of consciousness and of intuitive consciousness. What
Saussure does not question here is the essential possibility of
nonintuition. Like Husserl, Saussure determines this nonintuition
teleologically as *crisis*. The *empty* symbolism[]{#calibre_link-2142}
of the written notation---in mathematical technique for example---is
also for Husserlian intuitionism that which exiles us far from the
*clear* evidence of the sense, that is to say from the full presence of
the signified in its truth, and thus opens the possibility of crisis.
This is indeed a crisis of the logos. Nevertheless, for Husserl, this
possibility remains linked with the very moment of
truth[]{#calibre_link-2143} and the production of ideal objectivity: it
has in fact an essential need for
writing.^[]{#calibre_link-577}[6](#calibre_link-199){.nounder}^ By one
entire aspect of his text, Husserl makes us think that the negativity of
the crisis is not a mere accident. But it is then the concept of crisis
that should be suspect, by virtue of what ties it to a dialectical and
teleological determination of negativity.

On the other hand, to account for "usurpation"[]{#calibre_link-2144} and
the origin of "passion," the classical and very superficial argument of
the solid permanence of the written thing, not to be simply false, calls
forth descriptions which are precisely no longer within the province of
psychology. Psychology will never be able to accommodate within its
space that which constitutes the absence of the signatory, to say
nothing of the absence of the referent.[]{#calibre_link-2145}
[]{#calibre_link-1087}Writing is the name of these two absences.
Besides, is it not contradictory to what is elsewhere affirmed about
language having "a definite and \[far more\] stable oral tradition that
is independent of writing" (p. 46) \[p. 24\], to explain the usurpation
by means of writing's power of *duration*, by means of the *durability*
of the substance of writing? If these two "stabilities" were of the same
nature,[]{#calibre_link-2146} and if the stability of the spoken
language were superior and independent, the origin of writing, its
"prestige" and its supposed harmfulness, would remain an inexplicable
mystery. It seems then as if Saussure wishes *at the same time* to
demonstrate the corruption of speech by writing, to denounce the harm
that the latter does to the former, *and* to underline the inalterable
and natural independence[]{#calibre_link-2147} of language. "Languages
are independent of writing" (p. 45) \[p. 24\]. Such is the truth of
nature. And yet nature is affected---from without---by an overturning
which modifies it in its interior, denatures it and obliges it to be
separated from itself. Nature denaturing itself, being separated *from
itself*, naturally gathering its outside into its inside, is
*catastrophe*, a natural event that overthrows[]{#calibre_link-2148}
nature, or *monstrosity*, a natural deviation within nature. The
function assumed in Rousseau's discourse by the catastrophe (as we shall
see), is here delegated to monstrousness. Let us cite the entire
conclusion of Chapter VI of the *Course* ("Graphic Representation of
Language"), which must be compared to Rousseau's text on
*Pronunciation:*

But the tyranny of writing goes even further. By
imposing[]{#calibre_link-2149} itself upon the masses, spelling
influences and modifies language. This happens only in highly literary
languages where written texts play an important role. Then visual images
lead to wrong *\[vicieuses\]* pronunciations; such mistakes are really
pathological. Spelling practices cause mistakes in the pronunciation of
many French words. For instance, there were two spellings for the
surname Lefèvre[]{#calibre_link-2150} (from latin *faber*), one popular
and simple, the other learned and etymological: *Lefèvre* and
*Lefèbvre*. Because ν and *u* were not kept apart in the old system of
writing, *Lefèbvre* was read as *Lefébure*, with a *b* that has never
really existed and a *u* that was the result of ambiguity. Now, the
latter form is actually pronounced (pp. 53--54) \[p. 31\].

Where is the evil? one will perhaps ask. And what[]{#calibre_link-2151}
has been invested in the "living word," that makes such "aggressions" of
writing intolerable? What investment begins by determining the constant
action of writing as a deformation and an aggression? What prohibition
has thus been transgressed? Where is the sacrilege? Why should the
mother tongue be protected from the operation of writing? Why determine
that operation as a violence, and why should[]{#calibre_link-2152} the
transformation be only a deformation? Why should the mother tongue not
have a history, or, what comes to the same thing, produce its own
history in a perfectly natural, autistic, and domestic way, without ever
being affected by any outside? Why wish to punish writing for a
monstrous crime, to the point of wanting to reserve for it, even
[]{#calibre_link-2153}within scientific treatments, a "special
compartment"[]{#calibre_link-2154} that holds it at a distance? For it
is indeed within a sort of intralinguistic leper colony that Saussure
wants to contain and concentrate the problem of deformations through
writing. And, in order to be convinced that he would take in very bad
part the innocent questions that I have just asked---for after all
*Lefébure is not a bad name* and we can love this play---let us read the
following. The passage[]{#calibre_link-2155} below explains to us that
the "play" is not "natural," and its accents are pessimistic:
"Mispronunciations due to spelling will probably appear more frequently
and as time goes on, the number of useless letters pronounced by
speakers will probably increase." As in Rousseau in the same context,
the Capital is accused: "Some Parisians already pronounce the *t* in
*sept femmes* 'seven women'." Strange[]{#calibre_link-2156} example. The
historical gap---for it is indeed history that one must stop in order to
protect language from writing---will only widen:

Darmsteter foresees the day when even the last two letters of *vingt*
"twenty" will be pronounced---truly an orthographic *monstrosity*. Such
phonic *deformations* belong to language but *do not stem from its
natural functioning*. They are due to an *external* influence.
Linguistics[]{#calibre_link-2157} should put them into a *special
compartment* for observation: they are *teratological* cases (p. 54;
italics added) \[pp. 31--32\].

It is clear that the concepts of stability, permanence, and duration,
which here assist thinking the relationships between speech and writing,
are too lax and open to every uncritical investiture. They would require
more attentive and minute analyses. The same is
applicable[]{#calibre_link-2158} to an explanation according to which
"most people pay more attention to visual impressions simply because
these are sharper and more lasting than aural impressions" (p. 46) \[p.
25\]. This explanation of "usurpation" is not only empirical in its
form, it is problematic in its content, it refers to a metaphysics and
to an old physiology of sensory faculties constantly disproved by
science, as by[]{#calibre_link-2159} the experience of language and by
the body proper as language. It imprudently makes of visibility the
tangible, simple, and essential element of writing. Above all, in
considering the audible as the *natural* milieu within which language
must *naturally* fragment and articulate its instituted signs, thus
exercising its arbitrariness, this explanation excludes all possibility
of some natural relationship[]{#calibre_link-2160} between speech and
writing at the very moment that it affirms it. Instead of deliberately
dismissing the notions of nature and institution that it constantly
uses, which ought to be done first, it thus confuses the two. It finally
and most importantly contradicts the principal affirmation according to
which "the thing that constitutes language *\[l'essentiel de la langue\]
is ...* unrelated to the phonic[]{#calibre_link-2161} character of the
linguistic sign" (p. 21) \[p. 7\]. This affirmation will soon
[]{#calibre_link-2162}occupy us; within it the other side of the
Saussurian proposition denouncing the "illusions of script" comes to the
fore.

What do these limits and presuppositions signify? First that a
linguistics is not *general* as long as it defines its outside and
inside in terms of *determined* linguistic models; as long as it
does[]{#calibre_link-2163} not rigorously distinguish essence from fact
in their respective degrees of generality. The system of writing in
general is not exterior to the system of language in general, unless it
is granted that the division between exterior and interior passes
through the interior of the interior or the exterior of the exterior, to
the point where the immanence of language is essentially exposed to the
intervention[]{#calibre_link-2164} of forces that are apparently alien
to its system. For the same reason, writing in general is not "image" or
"figuration" of language in general, except if the nature, the logic,
and the functioning of the image within the system from which one wishes
to exclude it be reconsidered. Writing is not a sign of a sign, except
if one says it of all signs, which would be more profoundly true.
If[]{#calibre_link-2165} every sign refers to a sign, and if "sign of a
sign" signifies writing, certain conclusions---which I shall consider at
the appropriate moment---will become inevitable. What Saussure saw
without seeing, knew without being *able* to take into account,
following in that the entire metaphysical tradition, is that a certain
model of writing was necessarily but provisionally imposed (but for the
inaccuracy[]{#calibre_link-2166} in principle, insufficiency of fact,
and the permanent usurpation) as instrument and technique of
representation of a system of language. And that this movement, unique
in style, was so profound that it permitted the thinking, *within
language*, of concepts like those of the sign, technique,
representation, language. The system of language associated with
phonetic-alphabetic writing is that within[]{#calibre_link-2167} which
logocentric metaphysics, determining the sense of being as presence, has
been produced. This logocentrism, this *epoch* of the full speech, has
always placed in parenthesis, *suspended*, and suppressed for essential
reasons, all free reflection on the origin and status of writing, all
science of writing which was not *technology* and the *history of a
technique*, itself leaning upon a mythology[]{#calibre_link-2168} and a
metaphor of a natural
writing.[]{#calibre_link-1131}[\*](#calibre_link-200){.nounder} It is
this logocentrism which, limiting the internal system of language in
general by a bad abstraction, prevents Saussure and the majority of his
successors^[]{#calibre_link-578}[7](#calibre_link-201){.nounder}^ from
determining fully and explicitly that which is called "the integral and
concrete object of linguistics" (p. 23) \[p. 7\].

But conversely, as I announced above, it is when he is not expressly
dealing[]{#calibre_link-2169} with writing, when he feels he has closed
the parentheses on that subject, that Saussure opens the field of a
general grammatology. Which []{#calibre_link-2170}would not only no
longer be excluded from general linguistics, but would dominate it and
contain it within itself. Then one realizes that what was chased off
limits, the wandering outcast of linguistics, has indeed never ceased to
haunt language as its primary[]{#calibre_link-2171} and most intimate
possibility. Then something which was never spoken and which is nothing
other than writing itself as the origin of language writes itself within
Saussure's discourse. Then we glimpse the germ of a profound but
indirect explanation of the usurpation and the traps condemned in
Chapter VI. This explanation will overthrow even the form of the
question to which it was a premature reply.

#### ***The Outside ![image](images/000000.jpg){.calibre7} the Inside*** {#calibre_link-16 .h3}

The thesis of the *arbitrariness* of the sign (so grossly misnamed, and
not only for the reasons Saussure himself
recognizes)^[]{#calibre_link-579}[8](#calibre_link-202){.nounder}^ must
forbid a radical distinction between the linguistic and the graphic
sign. No doubt this thesis concerns only the necessity of relationships
between specific signifiers and signifieds *within* an
allegedly[]{#calibre_link-2173} natural relationship between the voice
and sense in general, between the order of phonic signifiers and the
content of the signifieds ("the only natural bond, the only true bond,
the bond of sound"). Only these relationships between specific
signifiers and signifieds would be regulated by arbitrariness. Within
the "natural" relationship between phonic signifiers and their
signifieds *in general*[]{#calibre_link-2174}, the relationship between
each determined signifier and its determined signified would be
"arbitrary."

Now from the moment that one considers the totality of determined signs,
spoken, and a fortiori written, as unmotivated institutions, one must
exclude any relationship of natural subordination, any natural hierarchy
among signifiers or orders of signifiers. If "writing" signifies
inscription[]{#calibre_link-2175} and especially the durable institution
of a sign (and that is the only irreducible kernel of the concept of
writing), writing in general covers the entire field of linguistic
signs. In that field a certain sort of instituted signifiers may then
appear, "graphic" in the narrow and derivative sense of the word,
ordered by a certain relationship with other instituted---hence
"written," even if they are[]{#calibre_link-2176} "phonic"---signifiers.
The very idea of institution---hence of the arbitrariness of the
sign---is unthinkable before the possibility of writing and outside of
its horizon. Quite simply, that is, outside of the horizon itself,
outside the world as space of inscription, as the opening to the
emission and to the spatial *distribution* of signs, to the *regulated
play* of their differences, even if they are[]{#calibre_link-2177}
"phonic."

Let us now persist in using this opposition of nature and institution,
of *physis* and *nomos* (which also means, of course, a distribution and
division regulated in fact by *law*) which a meditation on writing
should disturb although []{#calibre_link-915}it functions everywhere as
self-evident, particularly in the discourse of linguistics. We must then
conclude that only the signs called *natural*, those
that[]{#calibre_link-2178} Hegel and Saussure call "symbols," escape
semiology as grammatology. But they fall a fortiori outside the field of
linguistics as the region of general semiology. The thesis of the
arbitrariness of the sign thus indirectly but irrevocably contests
Saussure's declared proposition when he chases writing to the outer
darkness of language. This thesis successfully accounts for a
conventional relationship[]{#calibre_link-2179} between the phoneme and
the grapheme (in phonetic writing, between the phoneme,
signifier-signified, and the grapheme, pure signifier), but by the same
token it forbids that the latter be an "image" of the former. Now it was
indispensable to the exclusion of writing as "external system," that it
come to impose an "image," a "representaton," or a "figuration," an
exterior reflection of the reality[]{#calibre_link-2180} of language.

It matters little, here at least, that there is in fact an ideographic
filiation of the alphabet. This important question is much debated by
historians of writing. What matters here is that in the synchronic
structure and systematic principle of alphabetic writing---and phonetic
writing in general---no relationship of "natural" representation, none
of resemblance or participation, no[]{#calibre_link-2181} "symbolic"
relationship in the Hegelian-Saussurian sense, no "iconographic"
relationship in the Peircian sense, be implied.

One must therefore challenge, in the very name of the arbitrariness of
the sign, the Saussurian definition of writing as "image"---hence as
natural symbol---of language. Not to mention the fact that the phoneme
is the *unimaginable* itself, and no visibility can *resemble* it,
it[]{#calibre_link-2182} suffices to take into account what Saussure
says about the difference between the symbol and the sign (p. 101) \[pp.
68--69\] in order to be completely baffled as to how he can at the same
time say of writing that it is an "image" or "figuration" of language
and define language and writing elsewhere as "two distinct systems of
signs" (p. 45) \[p. 23\]. For the property of the sign is not to be an
image.[]{#calibre_link-2183} By a process exposed by Freud in *The
Interpretation of Dreams*, Saussure thus accumulates contradictory
arguments to bring about a satisfactory decision: the exclusion of
writing. In fact, even within so-called phonetic writing, the "graphic"
signifier refers to the phoneme through a web of many dimensions which
binds it, like all signifiers, to other written and oral signifiers,
within a "total"[]{#calibre_link-2184} system open, let us say, to all
possible investments of sense. We must begin with the possibility of
that total system.

Saussure was thus never able to think that writing was truly an "image,"
a "figuration," a "representation" of the spoken language, a symbol. If
one considers that he nonetheless needed these inadequate notions to
decide upon the exteriority of writing, one must conclude
that[]{#calibre_link-2185} an entire stratum of his discourse, the
intention of Chapter VI ("Graphic Representation of Language"), was not
at all scientific. When I say this, my quarry is not
[]{#calibre_link-2186}primarily Ferdinand de Saussure's intention or
motivation, but rather the entire uncritical tradition which he
inherits. To what zone of discourse does this strange functioning of
argumentation belong, this coherence of desire
producing[]{#calibre_link-2187} itself in a near-oneiric way---although
it clarifies the dream rather than allow itself to be clarified by
it---through a contradictory logic? How is this functioning articulated
with the entirety of theoretical discourse, throughout the history of
science? Better yet, how does it work from within the concept of science
itself? It is only when this question is elaborated---if it is some
day---when the[]{#calibre_link-2188} concepts required by this
functioning are defined outside of all psychology (as of all sciences of
man), outside metaphysics (which can now be "Marxist" or
"structuralist"); when one is able to respect all its levels of
generality and articulation---it is only then that one will be able to
state rigorously the problem of the articulated appurtenance of a text
(theoretical or otherwise) to an entire[]{#calibre_link-2189} set: I
obviously treat the Saussurian text at the moment only as a telling
example within a given situation, without professing to use the concepts
required by the functioning of which I have just spoken. My
justification would be as follows: this and some other indices (in a
general way the treatment of the concept of writing) already give us the
assured means of broaching the de-construction[]{#calibre_link-2190} of
*the greatest totality---the* concept of the *epistém*è and logocentric
metaphysics---within which are produced, without ever posing the radical
question of writing, all the Western methods of analysis, explication,
reading, or interpretation.

Now we must think that writing is at the same time more exterior to
speech, not being its "image" or its "symbol," and more interior to
speech, which is already[]{#calibre_link-2191} in itself a writing. Even
before it is linked to incision, engraving, drawing, or the letter, to a
signifier referring in general to a signifier signified by it, the
concept of the *graphie* \[unit of a possible graphic system\] implies
the framework of the *instituted trace*, as the possibility common to
all systems of signification. My efforts will now be directed toward
slowly detaching these two[]{#calibre_link-2192} concepts from the
classical discourse from which I necessarily borrow them. The effort
will be laborious and we know a priori that its effectiveness will never
be pure and absolute.

The instituted trace is "unmotivated" but not capricious. Like the word
"arbitrary" according to Saussure, it "should not imply that the choice
of the signifier is left entirely to the speaker" (p. 101) \[pp.
68--69\].[]{#calibre_link-2193} Simply, it has no "natural attachment"
to the signified within reality. For us, the rupture of that "natural
attachment" puts in question the idea of naturalness rather than that of
attachment. That is why the word "institution" should not be too quickly
interpreted within the classical system of oppositions.

The instituted trace cannot be thought without thinking the retention of
difference[]{#calibre_link-2194} within a structure of reference where
difference appears *as []{#calibre_link-2195}such* and thus permits a
certain liberty of variations among the full terms. The absence of
*another* here-and-now, of another transcendental present, of *another*
origin of the world appearing as such, presenting itself as irreducible
absence within the presence of the trace, is not a metaphysical formula
substituted for a scientific concept[]{#calibre_link-2196} of writing.
This formula, beside the fact that it is the questioning of metaphysics
itself, describes the structure implied by the "arbitrariness of the
sign," from the moment that one thinks of its possibility *short of* the
derived opposition between nature and convention, symbol and sign, etc.
These oppositions have meaning only after the possibility of the trace.
The "unmotivatedness" of the[]{#calibre_link-2197} sign requires a
synthesis in which the completely other is announced as such---without
any simplicity, any identity, any resemblance or continuity---within
what is not it. *Is announced as such:* there we have all *history*,
from what metaphysics has defined as "non-living" up to "consciousness,"
passing through all levels of animal organization. The trace, where the
relationship with the other is marked,[]{#calibre_link-2198} articulates
its possibility in the entire field of the entity *\[étant\]*, which
metaphysics has defined as the being-present starting from the occulted
movement of the trace. The trace must be thought before the entity. But
the movement of the trace is necessarily occulted, it produces itself as
self-occultation. When the other announces itself as such, it presents
itsef in the dissimulation of itself.[]{#calibre_link-2199} This
formulation is not theological, as one might believe somewhat hastily.
The "theological" is a determined moment in the total movement of the
trace. The field of the entity, before being determined as the field of
presence, is structured according to the diverse possibilities---genetic
and structural---of the trace. The presentation of the other as such,
that is to say the dissimulation of[]{#calibre_link-2200} its "as such,"
has always already begun and no structure of the entity escapes it.

That is why the movement of "unmotivatedness" passes from one structure
to the other when the "sign" crosses the stage of the "symbol." It is in
a certain sense and according to a certain determined structure of the
"as such" that one is authorized to say that there is yet no
immotivation in what Saussure calls[]{#calibre_link-2201} "symbol" and
which, according to him, does not---at least provisionally---interest
semiology. The general structure of the unmotivated trace connects
within the same possibility, and they cannot be separated except by
abstraction, the structure of the relationship with the other, the
movement of temporalization, and language as writing. Without referring
back to a "nature," the immotivation of the trace[]{#calibre_link-2202}
has always *become*. In fact, there is no unmotivated trace: the trace
is indefinitely its own becoming-unmotivated. In Saussurian language,
what Saussure does not say would have to be said: there is neither
symbol nor sign but a becoming-sign of the symbol.

Thus, as it goes without saying, the trace whereof I speak is not more
[]{#calibre_link-889}*natural* (it is not the mark, the natural sign, or
the index in the[]{#calibre_link-2203} Husserlian sense) than
*cultural*, not more physical than psychic, biological than spiritual.
It is that starting from which a becoming-unmotivated of the sign, and
with it all the ulterior oppositions between *physis* and its other, is
possible.

In his project of semiotics, Peirce seems to have been more attentive
than Saussure to the irreducibility of this becoming-unmotivated. In his
terminology,[]{#calibre_link-2204} one must speak of a
becoming-unmotivated of the *symbol*, the notion of the symbol playing
here a role analogous to that of the sign which Saussure opposes
precisely to the symbol:

Symbols grow. They come into being by development out of other signs,
particularly from icons, or from mixed signs partaking of the nature of
icons and symbols. We think only in signs. These mental signs are of
mixed[]{#calibre_link-2205} nature; the symbol parts of them are called
concepts. If a man makes a new symbol, it is by thoughts involving
concepts. So it is only out of symbols that a new symbol can grow. Omne
symbolum de
symbolo.^[]{#calibre_link-581}[9](#calibre_link-203){.nounder}^

Peirce complies with two apparently incompatible exigencies. The mistake
here would be to sacrifice one for the other. It must be recognized that
the symbolic (in Peirce's sense: of "the
arbitrariness[]{#calibre_link-2206} of the sign") is rooted in the
nonsymbolic, in an anterior and related order of signification: "Symbols
grow. They come into being by development out of other signs,
particularly from icons, or from mixed signs." But these roots must not
compromise the structural originality of the field of symbols, the
autonomy of a domain, a production, and a play: "So it is only out of
symbols that a[]{#calibre_link-2207} new symbol can grow. Omne symbolum
de symbolo."

But in both cases, the genetic root-system refers from sign to sign. No
ground of nonsignification---understood as insignificance or an
intuition of a present truth---stretches out to give it foundation under
the play and the coming into being of signs. Semiotics no longer depends
on logic. Logic, according to Peirce, is only a semiotic: "Logic,
in[]{#calibre_link-2208} its general sense, is, as I believe I have
shown, only another name for semiotics (*semeiotike*), the
quasi-necessary, or formal, doctrine of signs." And logic in the
classical sense, logic "properly speaking," nonformal logic commanded by
the value of truth, occupies in that semiotics only a determined and not
a fundamental level. As in Husserl (but the analogy, although it is most
thought-provoking,[]{#calibre_link-2209} would stop there and one must
apply it carefully), the lowest level, the foundation of the possibility
of logic (or semiotics) corresponds to the project of the *Grammatica
speculativa* of Thomas d'Erfurt, falsely attributed to Duns Scotus. Like
Husserl, Peirce expressly refers to it. It is a matter of elaborating,
in both cases, a formal doctrine of conditions which a discourse must
satisfy in[]{#calibre_link-2210} order to have a sense, in order to
"mean," even []{#calibre_link-890}if it is false or contradictory. The
general morphology of that
meaning^[]{#calibre_link-582}[10](#calibre_link-204){.nounder}^
(*Bedeutung, vouloir-dire*) is independent of all logic of truth.

The science of semiotic has three branches. The first is called by Duns
Scotus *grammatica speculativa*. We may term it *pure grammar*. It has
for its task to ascertain what must be true of the representamen
used[]{#calibre_link-2211} by every scientific intelligence in order
that they may embody any *meaning*. The second is logic proper. It is
the science of what is quasi-necessarily true of the representamina of
any scientific intelligence in order that they may hold good of any
*object*, that is, may be true. Or say, logic proper is the formal
science of the conditions of the truth of representations. The third, in
imitation[]{#calibre_link-2212} of Kant's fashion of preserving old
associations of words in finding nomenclature for new conceptions, I
call *pure rhetoric*. Its task is to ascertain the laws by which in
every scientific intelligence one sign gives birth to another, and
especially one thought brings forth
another.^[]{#calibre_link-583}[11](#calibre_link-205){.nounder}^

Peirce goes very far in the direction that I have called the
de-construction of the transcendental signified,[]{#calibre_link-2213}
which, at one time or another, would place a reassuring end to the
reference from sign to sign. I have identified logocentrism and the
metaphysics of presence as the exigent, powerful, systematic, and
irrepressible desire for such a signified. Now Peirce considers the
indefiniteness of reference as the criterion that allows us to recognize
that we are indeed dealing with a system of signs.
*What[]{#calibre_link-2214} broaches the movement of signification is
what makes its interruption impossible. The thing itself is a sign*. An
unacceptable proposition for Husserl, whose phenomenology remains
therefore---in its "principle of principles"---the most radical and most
critical restoration of the metaphysics of presence. The difference
between Husserl's and Peirce's phenomenologies is fundamental since it
concerns[]{#calibre_link-2215} the concept of the sign and of the
manifestation of presence, the relationships between the re-presentation
and the originary presentation of the thing itself (truth). On this
point Peirce is undoubtedly closer to the inventor of the word
*phenomenology:* Lambert proposed in fact to "reduce *the theory of
things* to the *theory of signs."* According to the "phaneoroscopy" or
"phenomenology" of Peirce,[]{#calibre_link-2216} *manifestation* itself
does not reveal a presence, it makes a sign. One may read in the
*Principle of Phenomenology* that "the idea of *manifestation* is the
idea of a sign."^[]{#calibre_link-584}[12](#calibre_link-206){.nounder}^
There is thus no phenomenality reducing the sign or the representer so
that the thing signified may be allowed to glow finally in the
luminosity of its presence. The so-called "thing itself" is always
already a *representamen*[]{#calibre_link-2217} shielded from the
simplicity of intuitive evidence. The *representamen* functions only by
giving rise to an *interpretant* that itself becomes a sign and so on to
infinity. The self-identity of the signified conceals itself unceasingly
and is always on the move. The property of the *representamen* is to be
itself and another, to be produced as a structure of
[]{#calibre_link-849}reference, to be separated from itself.
The[]{#calibre_link-2218} property of the *representamen* is not to be
*proper* \[*propre*\], that is to say absolutely *proximate* to itself
(*prope, proprius*). The *represented* is always already a
*representamen*. Definition of the sign:

*Anything which determines something else (its interpretant) to refer to
an object to which itself refers (its object) in the same way, this
interpretant becoming in turn a sign, and so on ad
infinitum*[]{#calibre_link-2219}.... If the series of successive
interpretants comes to an end, the sign is thereby rendered imperfect,
at least.^[]{#calibre_link-586}[13](#calibre_link-207){.nounder}^

From the moment that there is meaning there are nothing but signs. We
*think only in signs*. Which amounts to ruining the notion of the sign
at the very moment when, as in Nietzsche, its exigency is recognized in
the absoluteness of its right. One could call *play* the absence of the
transcendental[]{#calibre_link-2220} signified as limitlessness of play,
that is to say as the destruction of ontotheology and the metaphysics of
presence. It is not surprising that the shock, shaping and undermining
metaphysics since its origin, lets itself *be named as such* in the
period when, refusing to bind linguistics to semantics (which all
European linguists, from Saussure to Hjemslev, still do), expelling the
problem of *[]{#calibre_link-2221}meaning* outside of their researches,
certain American linguists constantly refer to the model of a game. Here
one must think of writing as a game within language. (The *Phaedrus*
(277e) condemned writing precisely as play---*paidia*---and opposed such
childishness to the adult gravity *\[spoudè\]* of speech). This *play*,
thought as absence of the transcendental signified, is not a play *in
the world*, as it has[]{#calibre_link-2222} always been defined, for the
purposes of *containing* it, by the philosophical tradition and as the
theoreticians of play also consider it (or those who, following and
going beyond Bloomfield, refer semantics to psychology or some other
local discipline). To think play radically the ontological and
transcendental problematics must first be seriously *exhausted;* the
question of the meaning of being,[]{#calibre_link-2223} the being of the
entity and of the transcendental origin of the world---of the world-ness
of the world---must be patiently and rigorously worked through, the
critical movement of the Husserlian and Heideggerian questions must be
effectively followed to the very end, and their effectiveness and
legibility must be conserved. Even if it were crossed out, without it
the concepts of play and writing to[]{#calibre_link-2224} which I shall
have recourse will remain caught within regional limits and an
empiricist, positivist, or metaphysical discourse. The counter-move that
the holders of such a discourse would oppose to the precritical
tradition and to metaphysical speculation would be nothing but the
worldly representation of their own operation. It is therefore *the game
of the world* that must be first thought; before[]{#calibre_link-2225}
attempting to understand all the forms of play in the
world.^[]{#calibre_link-587}[14](#calibre_link-208){.nounder}^

From the very opening of the game, then, we are within the
becoming-unmotivated of the symbol. With regard to this becoming, the
opposition of diachronic and synchronic is also derived. It would not be
able to command []{#calibre_link-836}a grammatology pertinently. The
immotivation of the trace ought now to be understood as an operation and
not as a[]{#calibre_link-2226} state, as an active movement, a
demotivation, and not as a given structure. Science of "the
arbitrariness of the sign," science of the immotivation of the trace,
science of writing before speech and in speech, grammatology would thus
cover a vast field within which linguistics would, by abstraction,
delineate its own area, with the limits that Saussure prescribes to its
internal system and which must[]{#calibre_link-2227} be carefully
reexamined in each speech/writing system in the world and history.

By a substitution which would be anything but verbal, one may replace
*semiology* by *grammatology* in the program of the *Course in General
Linguistics:*

I shall call it \[grammatology\]. ... Since the science does not yet
exist, no one can say what it would be; but it has a right to existence,
a place staked out in advance.[]{#calibre_link-2228} Linguistics is only
a part of \[that\] general science ... ; the laws discovered by
\[grammatology\] will be applicable to linguistics. (p. 33) \[p. 16\].

The advantage of this substitution will not only be to give to the
theory of writing the scope needed to counter logocentric repression and
the subordination to linguistics. It will liberate the semiological
project itself from what, in spite of its[]{#calibre_link-2229} greater
theoretical extension, remained *governed* by linguistics, organized as
if linguistics were at once its center and its telos. *Even though
semiology was in fact more general and more comprehensive than
linguistics, it continued to be regulated as if it were one of the areas
of linguistics. The linguistic sign remained exemplary for semiology*,
it dominated it as the master-sign and as the[]{#calibre_link-2230}
generative model: the pattern *\[patron\]*.

One could therefore say that signs that are wholly arbitrary realize
better than the others the ideal of the semiological process; that is
why language, the most complex and universal of all systems of
expression, is also the most characteristic; in this sense linguistics
can become *the master-pattern for all branches* of *semiology* although
language is only[]{#calibre_link-2231} one particular semiological
system (p. 101; italics added) \[p. 68\].

Consequently, reconsidering the order of dependence prescribed by
Saussure, apparently inverting the relationship of the part to the
whole, Barthes in fact carries out the profoundest intention of the
*Course:*

From now on we must admit the possibility of reversing Saussure's
proposition some day: linguistics is not a part,
even[]{#calibre_link-2232} if privileged, of the general science of
signs, it is semiology that is a part of
linguistics.^[]{#calibre_link-588}[15](#calibre_link-209){.nounder}^

This coherent reversal, submitting semiology to a "translinguistics,"
leads to its full explication a linguistics historically dominated by
logocentric metaphysics, for which in fact there is not and there should
not be []{#calibre_link-2233}"any meaning except as named" (ibid.).
Dominated by the so-called "civilization[]{#calibre_link-2234} of
writing" that we inhabit, a civilization of so-called phonetic writing,
that is to say of the logos where the sense of being is, in its telos,
determined as parousia. The Barthesian reversal is fecund and
indispensable for the description of the *fact and the vocation of
signification* within the closure of this epoch and this civilization
that is in the process of disappearing in its very globalization.

Let us now try to go beyond these formal and architectonic
considerations. Let us ask in a more intrinsic and concrete way, how
language is not merely a sort of writing, "comparable to a system of
writing" (p. 33) \[p. 16\]---Saussure writes curiously---but a species
*of* writing. Or rather, since writing no longer relates to language as
an extension or frontier, let us ask how language is a
possibility[]{#calibre_link-2236} founded on the general possibility of
writing. Demonstrating this, one would give at the same time an account
of that alleged "usurpation" which could not be an unhappy accident. It
supposes on the contrary a common root and thus excludes the resemblance
of the "image," derivation, or representative reflexion. And thus one
would bring back to its true meaning, to its primary possibility, the
apparently[]{#calibre_link-2237} innocent and didactic analogy which
makes Saussure say:

Language is \[comparable to\] a system of signs that express ideas, and
is therefore *comparable to writing*, the alphabet of deaf-mutes,
symbolic rites, polite formulas, military signals, etc. But it is the
most important of all these systems (p. 33; italics added) \[p. 16\].

Further, it is not by chance that, a hundred and thirty pages
later,[]{#calibre_link-2238} at the moment of explaining *phonic
difference* as the condition of linguistic *value* ("from a material
viewpoint"),^[]{#calibre_link-589}[16](#calibre_link-210){.nounder}^ he
must again borrow all his pedagogic resources from the example of
writing:

Since an identical state of affairs is observable in writing, another
system of signs, we shall use writing to draw some comparisons that will
clarify the whole issue (p. 165) \[p. 119\].

Four demonstrative[]{#calibre_link-2239} items, borrowing pattern and
content from writing,
follow.^[]{#calibre_link-590}[17](#calibre_link-211){.nounder}^

Once more, then, we definitely have to oppose Saussure to himself.
Before being or not being "noted," "represented," "figured," in a
*"graphie,"* the linguistic sign implies an originary writing.
Henceforth, it is not to the thesis of the arbitrariness of the sign
that I shall appeal directly, but to what Saussure associates with it
as[]{#calibre_link-2240} an indispensable correlative and which would
seem to me rather to lay the foundations for it: the thesis of
*difference* as the source of linguistic
value.^[]{#calibre_link-591}[18](#calibre_link-212){.nounder}^

What are, from the grammatological point of view, the consequences of
[]{#calibre_link-957}this theme that is now so well-known (and upon
which Plato already reflected in the *Sophist)?*

By definition, difference is never in itself a sensible plenitude.
Therefore,[]{#calibre_link-2241} its necessity contradicts the
allegation of a naturally phonic essence of language. It contests by the
same token the professed natural dependence of the graphic signifier.
That is a consequence Saussure himself draws against the premises
defining the internal system of language. He must now exclude the very
thing which had permitted him to exclude writing: sound and its "natural
bond" *\[lien naturel\]*[]{#calibre_link-2242} with meaning. For
example: "The thing that constitutes language is, as I shall show later,
unrelated to the phonic character of the linguistic sign" (p. 21) \[p.
7\]. And in a paragraph on difference:

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2243}
:::

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2244}
:::

It is impossible for sound alone, a material element, to belong to
language. It is only a secondary thing, substance to be put to use. All
our conventional values have the characteristic of not being confused
with the tangible element which supports them. ... The linguistic
signifier ... is not \[in essence\] phonic but incorporeal---constituted
not by its material substance but the differences that
separate[]{#calibre_link-2245} its sound-image from all others (p. 164)
\[pp. 118--19\]. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of
less importance than the other signs that surround it (p. 166) \[p.
120\]

Without this reduction of phonic matter, the distinction between
language and speech, decisive for Saussure, would have no rigor. It
would be the same for the oppositions that happened to descend from it:
between[]{#calibre_link-2246} code and message, pattern and usage, etc.
Conclusion: "Phonology---this bears repeating---is only an auxiliary
discipline \[of the science of language\] and belongs exclusively to
speaking" (p. 56) \[p. 33\]. Speech thus draws from this stock of
writing, noted or not, that language is, and it is here that one must
meditate upon the complicity between the two "stabilities." The
reduction of the *phonè* reveals[]{#calibre_link-2247} this complicity.
What Saussure says, for example, about the sign in general and what he
"confirms" through the example of writing, applies also to language:
"Signs are governed by a principle of general semiology: continuity in
time is coupled to change in time; this is confirmed by orthrographic
systems, the speech of deaf-mutes, etc." (p. 111) \[p. 16\].

The reduction of phonic substance thus[]{#calibre_link-2248} does not
only permit the distinction between phonetics on the one hand (and a
fortiori accoustics or the physiology of the phonating organs) and
phonology on the other. It also makes of phonology itself an "auxiliary
discipline." Here the direction indicated by Saussure takes us beyond
the phonologism of those who profess to follow him on this point: in
fact, Jakobson believes indifference to the[]{#calibre_link-2249} phonic
substance of expression to be impossible and illegitimate. He thus
criticizes the glossematics of Hjelmslev which requires and practices
[]{#calibre_link-893}the neutralizing of sonorous substance. And in the
text cited above, Jakobson and Halle maintain that the "theoretical
requirement" of a research of invariables placing sonorous substance in
parenthesis (as an empirical and contingent content) is:

1\. *[]{#calibre_link-2250}impracticable* since, as "Eli
Fischer-Jorgensen exposes \[it\]," "the sonorous substance \[is taken
into account\] at every step of the
analysis."[]{#calibre_link-1133}[\*](#calibre_link-213){.nounder} But is
that a "troubling discrepancy," as Jakobson and Halle would have it? Can
one not account for it as a fact serving as an example, as do the
phenomenologists who always need, keeping it always within sight, an
exemplary empirical content in the reading[]{#calibre_link-2251} of an
essence which is independent of it by right?

2\. *inadmissible in principle* since one cannot consider "that in
language form is opposed to substance as a constant to a variable." It
is in the course of this second demonstration that the literally
Saussurian formulas reappear within the question of the relationships
between speech and writing; the order of writing is the order of
exteriority,[]{#calibre_link-2252} of the "occasional," of the
"accessory," of the "auxiliary," of the *"parasitic"* (pp. 116--17;
italics added) \[pp. 16--17\]. The argument of Jakobson and Halle
appeals to the factual genesis and invokes the secondariness of writing
in the colloquial sense: "Only after having mastered speech does one
graduate to reading and writing." Even if this commonsensical
proposition were rigorously proved---something[]{#calibre_link-2253}
that I do not believe (since each of its concepts harbors an immense
problem)---one would still have to receive assurance of its pertinence
to the argument. Even if "after" were here a facile representation, if
one knew perfectly well what one thought and stated while assuring that
one learns to write *after* having learned to speak, would that suffice
to conclude that what thus comes "after" is
parasitic?[]{#calibre_link-2254} And what is a parasite? And what if
writing were precisely that which makes us reconsider our logic of the
parasite?

In another moment of the critique, Jakobson and Halle recall the
imperfection of graphic representation; that imperfection is due to "the
cardinally dissimilar patterning of letters and phonemes:"

Letters never, or only partially, reproduce the different distinctive
features on[]{#calibre_link-2255} which the phonemic pattern is based
and unfailingly disregard the structural relationship of these features
(p. 116) \[p. 17\].

I have suggested it above: does not the radical dissimilarity of the two
elements---graphic and phonic---exclude derivation? Does not the
inadequacy of graphic representation concern only common alphabetic
writing, to which glossematic formalism does not essentially
refer?[]{#calibre_link-2256} Finally, if one
[]{#calibre_link-1005}accepts all the phonologist arguments thus
presented, it must still be recognized that they oppose a "scientific"
concept of the spoken word to a vulgar concept of writing. What I would
wish to show is that one cannot exclude writing from the general
experience of "the structural relationship of these features." Which
amounts, of course, to reforming the concept of writing.

In[]{#calibre_link-2257} short, if the Jakobsonian analysis is faithful
to Saussure in this matter, is it not especially so to the Saussure of
Chapter VI? Up to what point would Saussure have maintained the
inseparability of matter and form, which remains the most important
argument of Jakobson and Halle (p. 117), \[p. 17\]? The question may be
repeated in the case of the position of André Martinet who, in this
debate, follows[]{#calibre_link-2258} Chapter VI of the *Course* to the
letter.^[]{#calibre_link-592}[19](#calibre_link-214){.nounder}^ And only
Chapter VI, from which Martinet *expressly* dissociates the doctrine of
what, in the *Course*, effaces the privilege of phonic substance. After
having explained why "a dead language with a perfect ideography," that
is to say a communication effective through the system of a generalized
script, "could not have any real autonomy," and why
*nevertheless*[]{#calibre_link-2259}, "such a system would be something
so particular that one can well understand why linguists *want to
exclude it* from the domain of their science" (*La linguistique
syncronique*, p. 18; italics added), Martinet criticizes those who,
following a certain trend in Saussure, question the essentially phonic
character of the linguistic sign: "Much will be attempted to prove that
Saussure is right when he[]{#calibre_link-2260} announces that 'the
thing that constitutes language *\[l'essentiel de la langue\]* is ...
unrelated to the phonic character of the linguistic sign,' and, going
beyond the teaching of the master, to declare that the linguistic sign
does not necessarily have that phonic character" (p. 19).

On that precise point, it is not a question of "going beyond" the
master's teaching but of following and extending[]{#calibre_link-2261}
it. Not to do it is to cling to what in Chapter VI greatly limits formal
and structural research and contradicts the least contestable findings
of Saussurian doctrine. To avoid "going beyond," one risks returning to
a point that falls short.

I believe that generalized writing is not just the idea of a system to
be invented, an hypothetical characteristic or a future possibility. I
think on the[]{#calibre_link-2262} contrary that oral language already
belongs to this writing. But that presupposes a modification of the
concept of writing that we for the moment merely anticipate. Even
supposing that one is not given that modified concept, supposing that
one is considering a system of pure writing as an hypothesis for the
future or a working hypothesis, faced with that hypothesis, should a
linguist refuse himself[]{#calibre_link-2263} the means of thinking it
and of integrating its formulation within his theoretical discourse?
Does the fact that most linguists do so create a theoretical right?
Martinet seems to be []{#calibre_link-2264}of that opinion. After having
elaborated a purely "dactylological" hypothesis of language, he writes,
in effect:

It must be recognized that the parallelism between this "dactylology"
and phonology is complete as[]{#calibre_link-2265} much in synchronic as
in diachronic material, and that the terminology associated with the
latter may be used for the former, except of course when the terms refer
to the phonic substance. Clearly, if we do not *desire* to exclude from
the domain of linguistics the systems of the type we have just imagined,
it is most important to modify traditional terminology relative to the
articulation of signifiers[]{#calibre_link-2266} so as to eliminate all
reference to phonic substance; as does Louis Hjelmslev when he uses
"ceneme" and "cenematics" instead of "phoneme" and "phonematics." *Yet
it is understandable that the majority of linguists hesitate to modify
completely the traditional terminological edifice for the only
theoretical advantages of being able to include in the field of their
science some purely hypothetical[]{#calibre_link-2267} systems*. To
*make them agree to envisage such a revolution*, they must be persuaded
that, in attested linguistic systems, they have no advantage in
considering the phonic substance of units of expression as to be of
direct interest (pp. 20--21; italics added).

Once again, we do not doubt the value of these phonological arguments,
the presuppositions behind which I have attempted to expose
above.[]{#calibre_link-2268} Once one assumes these presuppositions, it
would be absurd to reintroduce confusedly a derivative writing, in the
area of oral language and within the system of this derivation. Not only
would ethnocentrism not be avoided, but all the frontiers within the
sphere of its legitimacy would then be confused. It is not a question of
rehabilitating writing in the narrow sense, nor of reversing the
order[]{#calibre_link-2269} of dependence when it is evident.
Phonologism does not brook any objections as long as one conserves the
colloquial concepts of speech and writing which form the solid fabric of
its argumentation. Colloquial and quotidian conceptions, inhabited
besides---uncontradictorily enough---by an old history, limited by
frontiers that are hardly visible yet all the more rigorous by that very
fact.

I would[]{#calibre_link-2270} wish rather to suggest that the alleged
derivativeness of writing, however real and massive, was possible only
on one condition: that the "original," "natural," etc. language had
never existed, never been intact and untouched by writing, that it had
itself always been a writing. An arche-writing whose necessity and new
concept I wish to indicate and outline here; and which I continue to
call writing[]{#calibre_link-2271} only because it essentially
communicates with the vulgar concept of writing. The latter could not
have imposed itself historically except by the dissimulation of the
arche-writing, by the desire for a speech displacing its other and its
double and working to reduce its difference. If I persist in calling
that difference writing, it is because, within the work of historical
repression, writing was,[]{#calibre_link-2272} by its situation,
destined to signify the most formidable difference. It threatened the
desire for the living speech from the closest proximity, it *breached*
[]{#calibre_link-958}living speech from within and from the very
beginning. And as we shall begin to see, difference cannot be thought
without the *trace*.

This arche-writing, although its concept is *invoked* by the themes of
"the arbitrariness of the sign" and[]{#calibre_link-2273} of difference,
cannot and can never be recognized as the *object of a science*. It is
that very thing which cannot let itself be reduced to the form of
*presence*. The latter orders all objectivity of the object and all
relation of knowledge. That is why what I would be tempted to consider
in the development of the *Course* as "progress," calling into question
in return the uncritical positions of Chapter[]{#calibre_link-2274} VI,
never gives rise to a new "scientific" concept of writing.

Can one say as much of the algebraism of Hjelmslev, which undoubtedly
drew the most rigorous conclusions from that progress?

The *Principes de grammaire générale* (1928) separated out within the
doctrine of the *Course* the phonological principle and the principle of
difference: It isolated a concept of *form* which permitted a
distinction[]{#calibre_link-2275} between formal difference and phonic
difference, and this even within "spoken" language (p. 117). Grammar is
independent of semantics and phonology (p. 118).

That independence is the very principle of glossematics as the formal
science of language. Its formality supposes that "there is no necessary
connexion between sounds and
language."^[]{#calibre_link-593}[20](#calibre_link-215){.nounder}^ That
formality is itself the condition of a purely
functional[]{#calibre_link-2276} analysis. The idea of a linguistic
function and of a purely linguistic unit---the glosseme---excludes then
not only the consideration of the substance of expression (material
substance) but also that of the substance of the content (immaterial
substance). "Since language is a form and not a substance (Saussure),
the glossemes are by definition independent of substance, immaterial
(semantic, psychological[]{#calibre_link-2277} and logical) and material
(phonic, graphic,
etc.)."^[]{#calibre_link-594}[21](#calibre_link-216){.nounder}^ The
study of the functioning of language, of its *play*, presupposes that
the substance of *meaning* and, among other possible substances, that of
*sound*, be placed in parenthesis. The unity of sound and of sense is
indeed here, as I proposed above, the reassuring closing of play.
Hjelmslev situates his concept of the *scheme* or *play* of
language[]{#calibre_link-2278} within Saussure's heritage---of
Saussure's formalism and his theory of value. Although he prefers to
compare linguistic value to the "value of exchange in the economic
sciences" rather than to the "purely logico-mathematical value," he
assigns a limit to this analogy.

An economic value is by definition a value with two faces: not only does
it play the role of a constant vis-à-vis the concrete
units[]{#calibre_link-2279} of money, but it also itself plays the role
of a variable vis-à-vis a fixed quantity of merchandise which serves it
as a standard. In linguistics on the other hand there is nothing that
corresponds to a standard. That is why the game of chess and not
economic fact remains for Saussure the most faithful image of a grammar.
The scheme of language is in the last analysis *a game* and nothing
more.^[]{#calibre_link-595}[22](#calibre_link-217){.nounder}^

[]{#calibre_link-1093}In the *Prolegomena to a Theory of Language*
(1943), setting forth the opposition *expression/content*, which he
substitutes for the difference *signifier/signified*, and in which each
term may be considered from the point of view of *form* or *substance*,
Hjelmslev criticizes the idea of a language *naturally* bound to the
substance of phonic expression. It is by mistake that it has hitherto
been supposed[]{#calibre_link-2281} "that the substance-expression of a
spoken language should consist of 'sounds':"

Thus, as has been pointed out by the Zwirners in particular, the fact
has been overlooked that speech is accompanied by, and that certain
components of speech can be replaced by, gesture, and that in reality,
as the Zwirners say, not only the so-called organs of speech (throat,
mouth, and nose), but very nearly all[]{#calibre_link-2282} the striate
musculature cooperate in the exercise of "natural" language. Further, it
is possible to replace the usual sound-and-gesture substance with any
other that offers itself as appropriate under changed external
circumstances. Thus the same linguistic form may also be manifested in
writing, as happens with a phonetic or phonemic notation and with the
so-called phonetic orthographies, as for[]{#calibre_link-2283} example
the Finnish. Here is a "graphic" substance which is addressed
exclusively to the eye and which need not be transposed into a phonetic
"substance" in order to be grasped or understood. And this graphic
"substance" can, precisely from the point of view of the substance, be
of quite various
sorts.^[]{#calibre_link-596}[23](#calibre_link-218){.nounder}^

Refusing to presuppose a "derivation" of substances following from the
substance of phonic[]{#calibre_link-2284} expression, Hjelmslev places
this problem outside the area of structural analysis and of linguistics.

Moreover it is not always certain what is derived and what not; we must
not forget that the discovery of alphabetic writing is hidden in
prehistory \[n.: Bertrand Russell quite rightly calls attention to the
fact that we have no means of deciding whether writing or speech is the
older form of[]{#calibre_link-2285} human expression (*An Outline of
Philosophy* \[London, 1927\], p. 47)\], so that the assertion that it
rests on a phonetic analysis is only one of the possible diachronic
hypotheses; it may also be rested on a formal analysis of linguistic
structure. But in any case, as is recognized by modern linguistics,
diachronic considerations are irrelevant for synchronic descriptions
(pp. 104--05).

H. J. Uldall[]{#calibre_link-2286} provides a remarkable formulation of
the fact that glossematic criticism operates at the same time thanks to
Saussure and against him; that, as I suggested above, the proper space
of a grammatology is at the same time opened and closed by *The Course
in General Linguistics*. To show that Saussure did not develop "all the
theoretical consequences of his discovery," he writes:

It is even more curious[]{#calibre_link-2287} when we consider that the
practical consequences have been widely drawn, indeed had been drawn
thousands of years before Saussure, for it is only through the concept
of a difference between form and substance []{#calibre_link-1020}that we
can explain the possibility of speech and writing existing at the same
time as expressions of one and the same language. If either of these two
substances, the stream of air or the[]{#calibre_link-2288} stream of
ink, were an integral part of the language itself, it would not be
possible to go from one to the other without changing the
language.^[]{#calibre_link-597}[24](#calibre_link-219){.nounder}^

Undoubtedly the Copenhagen School thus frees a field of research: it
becomes possible to direct attention not only to the purity of a form
freed from all "natural" bonds to a substance but also to everything
that, in the stratification of language,[]{#calibre_link-2289} depends
on the substance of graphic expression. An original and rigorously
delimited description of this may thus be promised. Hjelmslev recognizes
that an "analysis of writing without regard to sound has not yet been
undertaken" (p. 105). While regretting also that "the substance of ink
has not received the same attention on the part of linguists that they
have so lavishly bestowed on the substance[]{#calibre_link-2290} of
air," H. J. Uldall delimits these problems and emphasizes the mutual
independence of the substances of expression. He illustrates it
particularly by the fact that, in orthography, no grapheme corresponds
to accents of pronunciation (for Rousseau this was the misery and the
menace of writing) and that, reciprocally, in pronunciation, no phoneme
corresponds to the spacing between written words[]{#calibre_link-2291}
(pp. 13--14).

Recognizing the specificity of *writing*, glossematics did not merely
give itself the means of describing the *graphic* element. It showed how
to reach the *literary* element, to what in literature passes through an
irreducibly graphic text, tying the *play of form* to a determined
substance of expression. If there is something in literature which does
not allow itself to be reduced to the[]{#calibre_link-2292} voice, to
epos or to poetry, one cannot recapture it except by rigorously
isolating the bond that links *the play of form* to the substance of
graphic expression. (It will by the same token be seen that "pure
literature," thus respected in its irreducibilty, also risks limiting
the play, restricting it. The desire to restrict play is, moreover,
irresistible.) This interest in literature is
effectively[]{#calibre_link-2293} manifested in the Copenhagen
School.^[]{#calibre_link-598}[25](#calibre_link-220){.nounder}^ It thus
removes the Rousseauist and Saussurian caution with regard to literary
arts. It radicalizes the efforts of the Russian formalists, specifically
of the O.PO.IAZ, who, in their attention to the being-literary of
literature, perhaps favored the phonological instance and the literary
models that it dominates. Notably poetry. That which, within the
history[]{#calibre_link-2294} of literature and in the structure of a
literary text in general, escapes that framework, merits a type of
description whose norms and conditions of possibility glossematics has
perhaps better isolated. It has perhaps thus better prepared itself to
study the purely graphic stratum within the structure of the literary
text within the history of the becoming-literary of literality, notably
in its[]{#calibre_link-2295} "modernity."

Undoubtedly a new domain is thus opened to new and fecund researches.
But I am not primarily interested in such a parallelism or such a
[]{#calibre_link-2296}recaptured parity of substances of expression. It
is clear that if the phonic substance lost its privilege, it was not to
the advantage of the graphic substance, which lends itself to the same
substitutions. To the extent that it liberates and
is[]{#calibre_link-2297} irrefutable, glossematics still operates with a
popular concept of writing. However original and irreducible it might
be, the "form of expression" linked by correlation to the *graphic*
"substance of expression" remains very determined. It is very dependent
and very derivative with regard to the arche-writing of which I speak.
This arche-writing would be at work not only in the form and
substance[]{#calibre_link-2298} of graphic expression but also in those
of nongraphic expression. It would constitute not only the pattern
uniting form to all substance, graphic or otherwise, but the movement of
the *sign-function* linking a content to an expression, whether it be
graphic or not. This theme could not have a place in Hjelmslev's system.

It is because arche-writing, movement of differance, irreducible
archesynthesis,[]{#calibre_link-2299} opening in one and the same
possibility, temporalization as well as relationship with the other and
language, cannot, as the condition of all linguistic systems, form a
part of the linguistic system itself and be situated as an object in its
field. (Which does not mean it has a real field *elsewhere, another*
assignable *site*.) Its concept could in no way enrich the scientific,
positive, and "immanent"[]{#calibre_link-2300} (in the Hjelmslevian
sense) description of the system itself. Therefore, the founder of
glossematics would no doubt have questioned its necessity, as he
rejects, en bloc and legitimately, all the extralinguistic theories
which do not arise from the irreducible immanence of the linguistic
system.^[]{#calibre_link-599}[26](#calibre_link-221){.nounder}^ He would
have seen in that notion one of those appeals to experience which a
theory should dispense[]{#calibre_link-2301}
with.^[]{#calibre_link-600}[27](#calibre_link-222){.nounder}^ He would
not have understood why the name writing continued to be used for that X
which becomes so different from what has always been called "writing."

I have already begun to justify this word, and especially the necessity
of the communication between the concept of arche-writing and the vulgar
concept of writing submitted to deconstruction by it. I shall continue
to do so below. As[]{#calibre_link-2302} for the concept of experience,
it is most unwieldy here. Like all the notions I am using here, it
belongs to the history of metaphysics and we can only use it under
erasure \[*sous rature\]*. "Experience" has always designated the
relationship with a presence, whether that relationship had the form of
consciousness or not. At any rate, we must, according to this sort of
contortion and contention which[]{#calibre_link-2303} the discourse is
obliged to undergo, exhaust the resources of the concept of experience
before attaining and in order to attain, by deconstruction, its ultimate
foundation. It is the only way to escape "empiricism" and the "naive"
critiques of experience at the same time. Thus, for example, the
experience whose "theory," Hjelmslev says, "must be independent" is not
the whole of experience. It[]{#calibre_link-2304} always corresponds to
a certain type of factual or regional experience (historical,
psychological, []{#calibre_link-966}physiological, sociological, etc.),
giving rise to a science that is itself regional and, as such,
rigorously outside linguistics. That is not so at all in the case of
experience as arche-writing. The parenthesizing of regions of experience
or of the totality of natural experience must discover
a[]{#calibre_link-2305} field of transcendental experience. This
experience is only accessible in so far as, after having, like
Hjelmslev, isolated the specificity of the linguistic system and
excluded all the extrinsic sciences and metaphysical speculations, one
asks the question of the transcendental origin of the system itself, as
a system of the objects of a science, and, correlatively, of the
theoretical system which[]{#calibre_link-2306} studies it: here of the
objective and "deductive" system which glossematics wishes to be.
Without that, the decisive progress accomplished by a formalism
respectful of the originality of its object, of "the immanent system of
its objects," is plagued by a scientificist objectivism, that is to say
by another unperceived or unconfessed metaphysics. This is often
noticeable in the work of the Copenhagen[]{#calibre_link-2307} School.
It is to escape falling back into this naive objectivism that I refer
here to a transcendentality that I elsewhere put into question. It is
because I believe that there is a short-of and a beyond of
transcendental criticism. To see to it that the beyond does not return
to the within is to recognize in the contortion the necessity of a
pathway *\[parcours\]*. That pathway must leave a
track[]{#calibre_link-2308} in the text. Without that track, abandoned
to the simple content of its conclusions, the ultra-transcendental text
will so closely resemble the precritical text as to be indistinguishable
from it. We must now form and meditate upon the law of this resemblance.
What I call the erasure of concepts ought to mark the places of that
future meditation. For example, the value of the transcendental
arche[]{#calibre_link-2309} *\[archie\]* must make its necessity felt
before letting itself be erased. The concept of arche-trace must comply
with both that necessity and that erasure. It is in fact contradictory
and not acceptable within the logic of identity. The trace is not only
the disappearance of origin---within the discourse that we sustain and
according to the path that we follow it means that the origin did not
even[]{#calibre_link-2310} disappear, that it was never constituted
except reciprocally by a nonorigin, the trace, which thus becomes the
origin of the origin. From then on, to wrench the concept of the trace
from the classical scheme, which would derive it from a presence or from
an originary nontrace and which would make of it an empirical mark, one
must indeed speak of an originary trace or arche-trace. Yet we know
that[]{#calibre_link-2311} that concept destroys its name and that, if
all begins with the trace, there is above all no originary
trace.^[]{#calibre_link-602}[28](#calibre_link-223){.nounder}^ We must
then *situate*, as a simple *moment of the discourse*, the
phenomenological reduction and the Husserlian reference to a
transcendental experience. To the extent that the concept of experience
in general---and of transcendental experience, in Husserl in
particular---remains governed by[]{#calibre_link-2312} the theme of
presence, it participates []{#calibre_link-2313}in the movement of the
reduction of the trace. The Living Present (*lebendige Gegenwart*) is
the universal and absolute form of transcendental experience to which
Husserl refers us. In the descriptions of the movements of
temporalization, all that does not torment the simplicity and the
domination of that form seems to indicate to us how much
transcendental[]{#calibre_link-2314} phenomenology belongs to
metaphysics. But that must come to terms with the forces of rupture. In
the originary temporalization and the movement of relationship with the
outside, as Husserl actually describes them, non-presentation or
depresentation is as "originary" as presentation. *That is why a thought
of the trace can no more break with a transcendental phenomenology than
be reduced to it*.[]{#calibre_link-2315} Here as elsewhere, to pose the
problem in terms of choice, to oblige or to believe oneself obliged to
answer it by a *yes* or *no*, to conceive of appurtenance as an
allegiance or nonappurtenance as plain speaking, is to confuse very
different levels, paths, and styles. In the deconstruction of the arche,
one does not make a choice.

Therefore I admit the necessity of going through the concept
of[]{#calibre_link-2316} the arche-trace. How does that necessity direct
us from the interior of the linguistic system? How does the path that
leads from Saussure to Hjelmslev forbid us to avoid the originary trace?

In that its passage through *form* is a passage through the *imprint*.
And the meaning of differance in general would be more accsessible to us
if the unity of that double passage appeared more clearly.

In both[]{#calibre_link-2317} cases, one must begin from the possibility
of neutralizing the phonic substance.

On the one hand, the phonic element, the term, the plenitude that is
called sensible, would not appear as such without the difference or
opposition which gives them *form*. Such is the most evident
significance of the appeal to difference as the reduction of phonic
substance. Here the appearing and functioning of
difference[]{#calibre_link-2318} presupposes an originary synthesis not
preceded by any absolute simplicity. Such would be the originary trace.
Without a retention in the minimal unit of temporal experience, without
a trace retaining the other as other in the same, no difference would do
its work and no meaning would appear. It is not the question of a
constituted difference here, but rather, before all determination
of[]{#calibre_link-2319} the content, of the *pure* movement which
produces difference. *The (pure) trace is differance*. It does not
depend on any sensible plentitude, audible or visible, phonic or
graphic. It is, on the contrary, the condition of such a plenitude.
Although it *does not exist*, although it is never a *being-present*
outside of all plenitude, its possibility is by rights anterior to all
that one calls sign (signified/signifier,[]{#calibre_link-2320}
content/expression, etc.), concept or opeartion, motor or sensory. This
differance is therefore not more sensible than intelligible and it
permits the articulation of signs among themselves within the same
abstract []{#calibre_link-2321}order---a phonic or graphic text for
example---or between two orders of expression. It permits the
articulation of speech and writing---in the colloquial sense---as it
founds the metaphysical[]{#calibre_link-2322} opposition between the
sensible and the intelligible, then between signifier and signified,
expression and content, etc. If language were not already, in that
sense, a writing, no derived "notation" would be possible; and the
classical problem of relationships between speech and writing could not
arise. Of course, the positive *sciences* of signification can only
describe the *work* and the *fact* of[]{#calibre_link-2323} differance,
the determined differences and the determined presences that they make
possible. There cannot be a science of differance itself in its
operation, as it is impossible to have a science of the origin of
presence itself, that is to say of a certain nonorigin.

Differance is therefore the formation of form. But it is *on the other
hand* the being-imprinted of the imprint. It is
well-known[]{#calibre_link-2324} that Saussure distinguishes between the
"sound-image" and the objective sound (p. 98) \[p. 66\]. He thus gives
himself the right to "reduce," in the phenomenological sense, the
sciences of accoustics and physiology at the moment that he institutes
the science of language. The sound-image is the structure of the
appearing of the sound *\[l'apparaître du son\]* which is anything but
the sound appearing *[]{#calibre_link-2325}\[le son apparaissant\]*. It
is the sound-image that he calls *signifier*, reserving the name
*signified* not for the thing, to be sure (it is reduced by the act and
the very ideality of language), but for the "concept," undoubtedly an
unhappy notion here; let us say for the ideality of the sense. "I
propose to retain the word *sign \[signe\]* to designate the whole and
to replace *concept* and *sound-image*[]{#calibre_link-2326}
respectively by *signified \[signifié\]* and *signifier
\[signifiant\]."* The sound-image is what is *heard;* not the *sound*
heard but the being-heard of the sound. Being-heard is structurally
phenomenal and belongs to an order radically dissimilar to that of the
real sound in the world. One can only divide this subtle but absolutely
decisive heterogeneity by a phenomenological reduction. The latter is
therefore[]{#calibre_link-2327} indispensable to all analyses of
being-heard, whether they be inspired by linguistic, psychoanalytic, or
other preoccupations.

Now the "sound-image," the structured appearing *\[l'apparaître\]* of
the sound, the "sensory matter" *lived* and *informed* by differance,
what Husserl would name the *hylè/morphé* structure, distinct from all
mundane reality, is called the "psychic image" by Saussure: "The
latter[]{#calibre_link-2328} \[the sound-image\] is not the material
sound, a purely physical thing, but the psychic imprint of the sound,
the impression that it makes on our senses *\[la repr*é*sentation que
nous en donne le témoignage de nos sens\]*. The sound-image is sensory,
and if I happen to call it 'material,' it is only in that sense, and by
way of opposing it, to the other term of the association, the concept,
which is[]{#calibre_link-2329} generally more abstract" (p. 98) \[p.
66\]. Although []{#calibre_link-842}the word "psychic" is not perhaps
convenient, except for exercising in this matter a phenomenological
caution, the originality of a certain place is well marked.

Before specifying it, let us note that this is not necessarily what
Jakobson and other linguists could criticize as "the mentalist point of
view":

In the oldest of these approaches,[]{#calibre_link-2330} going back to
Baudoum de Courtenay and still surviving, the phoneme is a sound
imagined or intended, opposed to the emitted sound as a "psychophonetic"
phenomenon to the "physiophonetic" fact. It is the psychic equivalent of
an exteriorized
sound.^[]{#calibre_link-603}[29](#calibre_link-224){.nounder}^

Although the notion of the "psychic image" thus defined (that is to say
according to a prephenomenological psychology of the imagination) is
indeed[]{#calibre_link-2331} of this mentalist inspiration, it could be
defended against Jakob-son's criticism by specifying: (1) that it could
be conserved without necessarily affirming that "our internal speech ...
is confined to the distinctive features to the exclusion of the
configurative, or redundant features;" (2) that the qualification
*psychic* is not retained if it designates exclusively *another natural
reality, internal[]{#calibre_link-2332} and not external*. Here the
Husserlian correction is indispensable and transforms even the premises
of the debate. Real (*reell* and not *real*) component of lived
experience, the *hylè/morphé* structure is not a reality (*Realität*).
As to the intentional object, for example, the content of the image, it
does not really (*reall*) belong either to the world or to lived
experience: the nonreal component of[]{#calibre_link-2333} lived
experience. The psychic image of which Saussure speaks must not be an
internal reality copying an external one. Husserl, who criticizes this
concept of "portrait" in *Ideen*
I[]{#calibre_link-1135}[\*](#calibre_link-225){.nounder} shows also in
the *Krisis* (pp. 63
f.)[]{#calibre_link-1136}[†](#calibre_link-226){.nounder} how
phenomenology should overcome the naturalist opposition---whereby
psychology and the other sciences of man survive---between "internal"
and "external" experience. It is therefore[]{#calibre_link-2334}
indispensable to preserve the distinction between the appearing sound
*\[le son apparaissant\]* and the appearing of the sound *\[l'apparaître
du son\]* in order to escape the worst and the most prevalent of
confusions; and it is in principle possible to do it without
"attempt\[ing\] to overcome the antinomy between invariance and
variability by assigning the former to the internal and the latter to
the[]{#calibre_link-2335} external experience" (Jakobson, op. cit., p.
112) \[p. 12\]. The difference between invariance and variability does
not separate the two domains from each other, it divides each of them
within itself. That gives enough indication that the essence of the
*phonè* cannot be read directly []{#calibre_link-988}and primarily in
the text of a mundane science, of a psycho-physiophonetics.

These precautions taken, it should be[]{#calibre_link-2336} recognized
that it is in the specific zone of this imprint and this trace, in the
temporalization of a *lived experience* which is neither *in* the world
nor in "another world," which is not more sonorous than luminous, not
more *in time* than *in* space, that differences appear among the
elements or rather produce them, make them emerge as such and constitute
the *texts*, the chains, and the systems of[]{#calibre_link-2337}
traces. These chains and systems cannot be outlined except in the fabric
of this trace or imprint. The unheard difference between the appearing
and the appearance *\[l'apparaissant et l'apparaître\]* (between the
"world" and "lived experience") is the condition of all other
differences, of all other traces, and *it is already a trace*. This last
concept is thus absolutely and by rights "anterior"
to[]{#calibre_link-2338} all *physiological* problematics concerning the
nature of the *engramme* \[the unit of engraving\], or *metaphysical*
problematics concerning the meaning of absolute presence whose trace is
thus opened to deciphering. *The trace is in fact the absolute origin of
sense in general. Which amounts to saying once again that there is no
absolute origin of sense in general. The trace is the differance* which
opens[]{#calibre_link-2339} appearance *\[l'apparaître\]* and
signification. Articulating the living upon the nonliving in general,
origin of all repetition, origin of ideality, the trace is not more
ideal than real, not more intelligible than sensible, not more a
transparent signification than an opaque energy and *no concept of
metaphysics can describe it*. And as it is *a fortiori* anterior to the
distinction between regions[]{#calibre_link-2340} of sensibility,
anterior to sound as much as to light, is there a sense in establishing
a "natural" hierarchy between the sound-imprint, for example, and the
visual (graphic) imprint? The graphic image is not seen; and the
acoustic image is not heard. The difference between the full unities of
the voice remains unheard. And, the difference in the body of the
inscription is also invisible.

Origin of the experience of space and time, this writing of difference,
this fabric of the trace, permits the difference between space and time
to be []{#calibre_link-1097}articulated, to appear as such, in the unity
of an experience (of a "same" lived out of a[]{#calibre_link-2343}
"same" body proper *\[corps propre\]*). This articulation therefore
permits a graphic ("visual" or "tactile," "spatial") chain to be
adapted, on occasion in a linear fashion, to a spoken ("phonic,"
"temporal") chain. It is from the primary possibility of this
articulation that one must begin. Difference is articulation.

This is, indeed, what Saussure says, contradicting Chapter VI:

The question[]{#calibre_link-2344} of the vocal apparatus obviously
takes a secondary place in the problem of language. One definition of
*articulated* language might confirm that conclusion. In Latin,
*articulus* means a member, part, or subdivision of a sequence; applied
to speech *\[langage\]*, articulation designates either the subdivision
of a spoken chain into syllables or the subdivision of the chain of
meanings into significant[]{#calibre_link-2345} units. ... Using the
second definition, we can say that *what is natural to mankind is not
spoken language* but the faculty of constructing a language; i.e., a
system of distinct signs corresponding to distinct ideas (p. 26; italics
added) \[p. 10\].

The idea of the "psychic imprint" therefore relates essentially to the
idea of articulation. Without the difference between the sensory
appearing *\[apparaissant\]*[]{#calibre_link-2346} and its lived
appearing *\[apparaître\]* ("mental imprint"), the temporalizing
synthesis, which permits differences to appear in a chain of
significations, could not operate. That the "imprint" is irreducible
means also that speech is originarily passive, but in a sense of
passivity that all intramundane metaphors would only betray. This
passivity is also the relationship to a past, to an
always-already-there[]{#calibre_link-2347} that no reactivation of the
origin could fully master and awaken to presence. This impossibility of
reanimating absolutely the manifest evidence of an originary presence
refers us therefore to an absolute past. That is what authorized us to
call *trace* that which does not let itself be summed up in the
simplicity of a present. It could in fact have been objected that, in
the indecomposable synthesis[]{#calibre_link-2348} of temporalization,
protection is as indispensable as retention. And their two dimensions
are not added up but the one implies the other in a strange fashion. To
be sure, what is anticipated in protention does not sever the present
any less from its self-identity than does that which is retained in the
trace. But if anticipation were privileged, the irreducibility of the
always-already-there[]{#calibre_link-2349} and the fundamental passivity
that is called time would risk effacement. On the other hand, if the
trace refers to an absolute past, it is because it obliges us to think a
past that can no longer be understood in the form of a modified
presence, as a present-past. Since past has always signified
present-past, the absolute past that is retained in the trace no longer
rigorously merits the name "past."[]{#calibre_link-2350} Another name to
erase, especially since the strange movement of the trace proclaims as
much as it recalls: differance defers-differs *\[diffère\]*. With the
same precaution and under the same erasure, it may be said that its
passivity is also its relationship with []{#calibre_link-845}the
"future." The concepts of *present, past*, and *future*, everything in
the concepts of time and history which implies evidence of
them---the[]{#calibre_link-2351} metaphysical concept of time in
general---cannot adequately describe the structure of the trace. And
deconstructing the simplicity of presence does not amount only to
accounting for the horizons of potential presence, indeed of a
"dialectic" of protention and retention that one would install in the
heart of the present instead of surrounding it with it. It is not a
matter of complicating the structure[]{#calibre_link-2352} of time while
conserving its homogeneity and its fundamental successivity, by
demonstrating for example that the past present and the future present
constitute originarily, by dividing it, the form of the living present.
Such a complication, which is in effect the same that Husserl described,
abides, in spite of an audacious phenomenological reduction, by the
evidence and presence of a linear,[]{#calibre_link-2353} objective, and
mundane model. *Now* B would be as such constituted by the retention of
*Now* A and the protention of *Now* C; in spite of all the play that
would follow from it, from the fact that each one of the three *Now-s*
reproduces that structure in itself, this model of successivity would
prohibit a *Now* X from taking the place of *Now* A, for example, and
would prohibit that, by a delay that is
inadmissible[]{#calibre_link-2354} to consciousness, an experience be
determined, in its very present, by a present which would not have
preceded it immediately but would be considerably "anterior" to it. It
is the problem of the deferred effect (*Nachträglichkeit*) of which
Freud speaks. The temporality to which he refers cannot be that which
lends itself to a phenomenology of consciousness or of presence and one
may indeed wonder[]{#calibre_link-2355} by what right all that is in
question here should still be called time, now, anterior present, delay,
etc.

In its greatest formality, this immense problem would be formulated
thus: is the temporality described by a transcendental phenomenology as
"dialectical" as possible, a ground which the structures, let us say the
unconscious structures, of temporality would simply modify? Or is the
phenomenological[]{#calibre_link-2356} model itself constituted, as a
warp of language, logic, evidence, fundamental security, upon a woof
that is not its own? And which---such is the most difficult problem---is
no longer at all mundane? For it is not by chance that the
transcendental phenomenology of the internal time-*consciousness*, so
careful to place cosmic time within brackets, must, as consciousness and
even as internal consciousness,[]{#calibre_link-2357} live a time that
is an accomplice of the time of the world. Between consciousness,
perception (internal or external), and the "world," the rupture, even in
the subtle form of the reduction, is perhaps not possible.

It is in a certain "unheard" sense, then, that speech is in the world,
rooted in that passivity which metaphysics calls sensibility in general.
Since there is no nonmetaphoric language[]{#calibre_link-2358} to oppose
to metaphors here, one must, as Bergson wished, multiply antagonistic
metaphors. "Wish sensibilized," is how Maine de Biran, with a slightly
different intention, []{#calibre_link-1004}named the vocalic word. That
the logos is first imprinted and that that imprint is the
writing-resource of language, signifies, to be sure, that the logos is
not a creative activity, the continuous full element of the
divine[]{#calibre_link-2359} word, etc. But it would not mean a single
step outside of metaphysics if nothing more than a new motif of "return
to finitude," of "God's death," etc., were the result of this move. It
is that conceptuality and that problematics that must be deconstructed.
They belong to the onto-theology they fight against. Differance is also
something other than finitude.

According to Saussure, the passivity[]{#calibre_link-2360} of speech is
first its relationship with language. The relationship between passivity
and difference cannot be distinguished from the relationship between the
fundamental *unconsciousness* of language (as rootedness within the
language) and the *spacing* (pause, blank, punctuation, interval in
general, etc.) which constitutes the origin of signification. It is
because "language is a form and not a[]{#calibre_link-2361} substance"
(p. 169) \[p. 122\] that, paradoxically, the activity of speech can and
must always draw from it. But if it is a form, it is because "in
language there are only differences" (p. 166) \[p. 120\]. *Spacing*
(notice that this word speaks the articulation of space and time, the
becoming-space of time and the becoming-time of space) is always the
unperceived, the nonpresent, and the nonconscious.[]{#calibre_link-2362}
As *such*, if one can still use that expression in a
non-phenomenological way; for here we pass the very limits of
phenomenology. Arche-writing as spacing cannot occur *as such* within
the phenomenological experience of a *presence*. It marks *the dead
time* within the presence of the living present, within the general form
of all presence. The dead time is at work. That is why, once again, in
spite of[]{#calibre_link-2363} all the discursive resources that the
former may borrow from the latter, the concept of the trace will never
be merged with a phenomenology of writing. As the phenomenology of the
sign in general, a phenomenology of writing is impossible. No intuition
can be realized in the place where "the 'whites' indeed take on an
importance" (Preface to *Coup de
d*é*s).[]{#calibre_link-1138}[\*](#calibre_link-227){.nounder}*

Perhaps it is now easier to understand[]{#calibre_link-2364} why Freud
says of the dreamwork that it is comparable rather to a writing than to
a language, and to a hieroglyphic rather than to a phonetic
writing.^[]{#calibre_link-604}[30](#calibre_link-228){.nounder}^ And to
understand why Saussure says of language that it "is not a function of
the speaker" (p. 30) \[p. 14\]. With or without the complicity of their
authors, all these propositions must be understood as more than the
simple *reversals* of a metaphysics[]{#calibre_link-2365} of presence or
of conscious subjectivity. Constituting and dislocating it at the same
time, writing is other than the subject, in whatever sense the latter is
understood. Writing can never be thought under the category of the
subject; however it is modified, however it is endowed with
consciousness or unconsciousness, it will refer, by the entire thread of
its []{#calibre_link-976}history, to the substantiality
of[]{#calibre_link-2366} a presence unperturbed by accidents, or to the
identity of the selfsame *\[le propre\]* in the presence of
self-relationship. And the thread of that history clearly does not run
within the borders of metaphysics. To determine an X as a subject is
never an operation of a pure convention, it is never an indifferent
gesture in relation to writing.

Spacing as writing is the becoming-absent and the
becoming-unconscious[]{#calibre_link-2367} of the subject. By the
movement of its drift/derivation *\[dérive\]* the emancipation of the
sign constitutes in return the desire of presence. That becoming---or
that drift/derivation---does not befall the subject which would choose
it or would passively let itself be drawn along by it. As the subject's
relationship with its own death, this becoming is the constitution of
subjectivity. On all levels[]{#calibre_link-2368} of life's
organization, that is to say, of *the economy of death*. All graphemes
are of a testamentary
essence.^[]{#calibre_link-605}[31](#calibre_link-229){.nounder}^ And the
original absence of the subject of writing is also the absence of the
thing or the referent.

Within the horizontality of spacing, which is in fact the precise
dimension I have been speaking of so far, and which is not opposed to it
as surface opposes depth, it is not even necessary[]{#calibre_link-2369}
to say that spacing cuts, drops, and causes to drop within the
unconscious: the unconscious is nothing without this cadence and before
this caesura. This signification is formed only within the hollow of
differance: of discontinuity and of discreteness, of the diversion and
the reserve of what does not appear. This hinge *\[brisure\]* of
language as writing, this discontinuity, could have, at a
given[]{#calibre_link-2370} moment within linguistics, run up against a
rather precious *continuist* prejudice. Renouncing it, phonology must
indeed renounce all distinctions between writing and the spoken word,
and thus renounce not itself, phonology, but rather phonologism. What
Jakobson recognizes in this respect is most important for us:

The stream of oral speech, physically continuous, originally confronted
the mathematical[]{#calibre_link-2371} theory of communication with a
situation "considerably more involved" (\[C.E.\] Shannon and \[W.\]
Weaver *\[The Mathematical Theory of Communication* (Urbana, 1949), pp.
74 f., 112 f.\]) than in the case of a finite set of discrete
constituents, as presented by written speech. Linguistic analysis,
however, came to resolve oral speech into a finite series of elementary
informational units. These ultimate[]{#calibre_link-2372} discrete
units, the so-called "distinctive features," are aligned into
simultaneous bundles termed "phonemes," which in turn are concatenated
into sequences. Thus form in language has a manifestly granular
structure and is subject to a quantal
description.^[]{#calibre_link-606}[32](#calibre_link-230){.nounder}^

The hinge *\[brisure\]* marks the impossibility that a sign, the unity
of a signifier and a signified, be produced within the plenitude of
a[]{#calibre_link-2373} present and an absolute presence. That is why
there is no full speech, however much one might wish to restore it by
means or without benefit of psychoanalysis. Before thinking to reduce it
or to restore the meaning of the full speech []{#calibre_link-907}which
claims to be truth, one must ask the question of meaning and of its
origin in difference. Such is the place of a problematic of the *trace*.

Why of the *trace?*[]{#calibre_link-2374} What led us to the choice of
this word? I have begun to answer this question. But this question is
such, and such the nature of my answer, that the place of the one and of
the other must constantly be in movement. If words and concepts receive
meaning only in sequences of differences, one can justify one's
language, and one's choice of terms, only within a topic \[an
orientation in space\] and an[]{#calibre_link-2375} historical strategy.
The justification can therefore never be absolute and definitive. It
corresponds to a condition of forces and translates an historical
calculation. Thus, over and above those that I have already defined, a
certain number of givens belonging to the discourse of our time have
progressively imposed this choice upon me. The word *trace* must refer
to itself to a certain number of[]{#calibre_link-2376} contemporary
discourses whose force I intend to take into account. Not that I accept
them totally. But the word *trace* establishes the clearest connections
with them and thus permits me to dispense with certain developments
which have already demonstrated their effectiveness in those fields.
Thus, I relate this concept of *trace* to what is at the center of the
latest work of Emmanuel Levinas and[]{#calibre_link-2377} his critique
of ontology:^[]{#calibre_link-607}[33](#calibre_link-231){.nounder}^
relationship to the illeity as to the alterity of a past that never was
and can never be lived in the originary or modified form of presence.
Reconciled here to a Heideggerian intention,---as it is not in Levinas's
thought---this notion signifies, sometimes beyond Heideggerian
discourse, the undermining of an ontology which, in its innermost
course, has determined the meaning[]{#calibre_link-2378} of being as
presence and the meaning of language as the full continuity of speech.
To make enigmatic what one thinks one understands by the words
"proximity," "immediacy," "presence" (the proximate *\[proche\]*, the
own *\[propre\]*, and the pre- of presence), is my final intention in
this book. This deconstruction of presence accomplishes itself through
the deconstruction of consciousness, and therefore[]{#calibre_link-2379}
through the irreducible notion of the trace (*Spur*), as it appears in
both Nietzschean and Freudian discourse. And finally, in all scientific
fields, notably in biology, this notion seems currently to be dominant
and irreducible.

If the trace, arche-phenomenon of "memory," which must be thought before
the opposition of nature and culture, animality and humanity, etc.,
belongs to the very movement[]{#calibre_link-2380} of signification,
then signification is a priori written, whether inscribed or not, in one
form or another, in a "sensible" and "spatial" element that is called
"exterior." Arche-writing, at first the possibility of the spoken word,
then of the *"graphie"* in the narrow sense, the birthplace of
"usurpation," denounced from Plato to Saussure, this trace is the
opening of the first exteriority in[]{#calibre_link-2381} general, the
enigmatic relationship of the living to its other and of an inside to an
outside: spacing. The outside, "spatial" and "objective" exteriority
which we believe we []{#calibre_link-927}know as the most familiar thing
in the world, as familiarity itself, would not appear without the
grammè, without differance as temporalization, without the nonpresense
of the other inscribed within the sense of the
present,[]{#calibre_link-2382} without the relationship with death as
the concrete structure of the living present. Metaphor would be
forbidden. The presence-absence of the trace, which one should not even
call its ambiguity but rather its play (for the word "ambiguity"
requires the logic of presence, even when it begins to disobey that
logic), carries in itself the problems of the letter and the spirit, of
body and soul, and[]{#calibre_link-2383} of all the problems whose
primary affinity I have recalled. All dualisms, all theories of the
immortality of the soul or of the spirit, as well as all monisms,
spiritualist or materialist, dialectical or vulgar, are the unique theme
of a metaphysics whose entire history was compelled to strive toward the
reduction of the trace. The subordination of the trace to the full
presence summed up in the[]{#calibre_link-2384} logos, the humbling of
writing beneath a speech dreaming its plenitude, such are the gestures
required by an onto-theology determining the archeological and
eschatological meaning of being as presence, as parousia, as life
without differance: another name for death, historical metonymy where
God's name holds death in check. That is why, if this movement begins
its era in the form of Platonism, it[]{#calibre_link-2385} ends in
infinitist metaphysics. Only infinite being can reduce the difference in
presence. In that sense, the name of God, at least as it is pronounced
within classical rationalism, is the name of indifference itself. Only a
positive infinity can lift the trace, "sublimate" it (it has recently
been proposed that the Hegelian *Aufhebung* be translated as
sublimation; this translation may be of dubious[]{#calibre_link-2386}
worth as translation, but the juxtaposition is of interest here). We
must not therefore speak of a "theological prejudice," functioning
sporadically when it is a question of the plenitude of the logos; the
logos as the sublimation of the trace is *theological*. Infinitist
theologies are always logocentrisms, whether they are creationisms or
not. Spinoza himself said of the understanding---or
logos---that[]{#calibre_link-2387} it was the *immediate* infinite mode
of the divine substance, even calling it its eternal son in the *Short
Treatise.[]{#calibre_link-1140}[\*](#calibre_link-232){.nounder}* It is
also to this epoch, "reaching completion" with Hegel, with a theology of
the absolute concept as logos, that all the noncritical concepts
accredited by linguistics belong, at least to the extent that
linguistics must confirm---and how can a *science* avoid it?---the
Saussurian decree[]{#calibre_link-2388} marking out "the internal system
of language."

It is precisely these concepts that permitted the exclusion of writing:
image or representation, sensible and intelligible, nature and culture,
nature and technics, etc. They are solidary with all metaphysical
conceptuality and particularly with a naturalist, objectivist, and
derivative determination of the difference between outside and inside.

[]{#calibre_link-826}[]{#calibre_link-2389}And above all with a "vulgar
concept of time." I borrow this expression from Heidegger. It
designates, at the end of *Being and Time*, a concept of time thought in
terms of spatial movement or of the now, and dominating all philosophy
from Aristotle's *Physics* to Hegel's
*Logic*.^[]{#calibre_link-608}[34](#calibre_link-233){.nounder}^ This
concept, which determines all of classical ontology, was not born out of
a philosopher's carelessness or from a theoretical[]{#calibre_link-2390}
lapse. It is intrinsic to the totality of the history of the Occident,
of what unites its metaphysics and its technics. And we shall see it
later associated with the linearization of writing, and with the
linearist concept of speech. This linearism is undoubtedly inseparable
from phonologism; it can raise its voice to the same extent that a
linear writing can seem to submit to it.
Saussure's[]{#calibre_link-2391} entire theory of the "linearity of the
signifier" could be interpreted from this point of view.

Auditory signifiers have at their command only the dimension of time.
Their elements are presented in succession; they form a chain. This
feature becomes readily apparent when they are represented in writing.
... The signifier, being auditory, is unfolded solely in time from which
it gets the following[]{#calibre_link-2392} characteristics: (a) it
represents a span, and (b) the span is measurable in a single dimension;
it is a line.^[]{#calibre_link-609}[35](#calibre_link-234){.nounder}^

It is a point on which Jakobson disagrees with Saussure decisively by
substituting for the homogeneousness of the line the structure of the
musical staff, "the chord in
music."^[]{#calibre_link-611}[36](#calibre_link-235){.nounder}^ What is
here in question is not Saussure's affirmation of the temporal essence
of discourse but the concept[]{#calibre_link-2393} of time that guides
this affirmation and analysis: time conceived as linear successivity, as
"consecutivity." This model works by itself and all through the
*Course*, but Saussure is seemingly less sure of it in the *Anagrams*.
At any rate, its value seems problematic to him and an interesting
paragraph elaborates a question left suspended:

That the elements forming a word *follow one another* is
a[]{#calibre_link-2394} truth that it would be better for linguistics
not to consider uninteresting because evident, but rather as the truth
which gives in advance the central principle of all useful reflections
on words. In a domain as infinitely special as the one I am about to
enter, it is always by virtue of the fundamental law of the human word
in general that a question like that of consecutiveness or
nonconsecutiveness[]{#calibre_link-2395} may be
posed.^[]{#calibre_link-612}[37](#calibre_link-236){.nounder}^

This linearist concept of time is therefore one of the deepest
adherences of the modern concept of the sign to its own history. For at
the limit, it is indeed the concept of the sign itself, and the
distinction, however tenuous, between the signifying and signified
faces, that remain committed to the history of classical ontology. The
parallelism and correspondence of the faces[]{#calibre_link-2396} or the
planes change nothing. That this distinction, first appearing in Stoic
logic, was necessary for the coherence of a scholastic thematics
dominated by infinitist theology, forbids us to treat today's debt to it
as a []{#calibre_link-2397}contingency or a convenience. I suggested
this at the outset, and perhaps the reasons are clearer now. The
*signatum* always referred, as to its referent, to a *res*, to an
entity[]{#calibre_link-2398} created or at any rate first thought and
spoken, thinkable and speakable, in the eternal present of the divine
logos and specifically in its breath. If it came to relate to the speech
of a finite being (created or not; in any case of an intracosmic entity)
through the *intermediary* of a *signans*, the *signatum* had an
*immediate* relationship with the divine logos which thought it within
presence and[]{#calibre_link-2399} for which it was not a trace. And for
modern linguistics, if the signifier is a trace, the signified is a
meaning thinkable in principle within the full presence of an intuitive
consciousness. The signfied face, to the extent that it is still
originarily distinguished from the signifying face, is not considered a
trace; by rights, it has no need of the signifier to be what it is. It
is at the depth[]{#calibre_link-2400} of this affirmation that the
problem of relationships between linguistics and semantics must be
posed. This reference to the meaning of a signified thinkable and
possible outside of all signifiers remains dependent upon the
onto-theo-teleology that I have just evoked. It is thus the idea of the
sign that must be deconstructed through a meditation upon writing which
would merge, as it must, with[]{#calibre_link-2401} the undoing
*\[sollicitation\]*[]{#calibre_link-1142}[\*](#calibre_link-237){.nounder}
of onto-theology, faithfully repeating it in its *totality* and *making*
it *insecure* in its most assured
evidences.^[]{#calibre_link-613}[38](#calibre_link-238){.nounder}^ One
is necessarily led to this from the moment that the trace affects the
totality of the sign in both its faces. That the signified is
originarily and essentially (and not only for a finite and created
spirit) trace, that it is *always already in the
position[]{#calibre_link-2402} of the signifier*, is the apparently
innocent proposition within which the metaphysics of the logos, of
presence and consciousness, must reflect upon writing as its death and
its resource.

### []{#calibre_link-2405 .calibre3}**3 *Of Grammatology as a Positive Science*** {#calibre_link-18 .h2}

On what conditions is a grammatology possible? Its fundamental condition
is certainly the undoing *\[sollicitation\]* of logocentrism. But this
condition of possibility turns into a condition of impossibility. In
fact it risks destroying the concept of science as well. Graphematics or
grammatography ought no longer to be presented as sciences; their goal
should[]{#calibre_link-2406} be exorbitant when compared to
grammat*ological knowledge*.

Without venturing up to that perilous necessity, and within the
traditional norms of scientificity upon which we fall back
provisionally, let us repeat the question; on what conditions is
grammatology possible?

On the condition of knowing what writing is and how the plurivocity of
this concept is formed. Where does writing begin?
When[]{#calibre_link-2407} does writing begin? Where and when does the
trace, writing in general, common root of speech and writing, narrow
itself down into "writing" in the colloquial sense? Where and when does
one pass from one writing to another, from writing in general to writing
in the narrow sense, from the trace to the *graphie*, from one graphic
system to another, and, in the field of a graphic code, from one
graphic[]{#calibre_link-2408} discourse to another, etc.?

*Where and how does it begin ...*? A question of origin. But a
meditation upon the trace should undoubtedly teach us that there is no
origin, that is to say simple origin; that the questions of origin carry
with them a metaphysics of presence. Without venturing here up to that
perilous necessity, continuing to ask questions of origin, we must
recognize its two levels.[]{#calibre_link-2409} "Where" and "when" may
open empirical questions: what, within history and within the world, are
the places and the determined moments of the first phenomena of writing?
These questions the investigation and research of facts must answer;
history in the colloquial sense, what has hitherto been practiced by
nearly all archeologists, epigraphists, and prehistorians who have
interrogated the world's scripts.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2410}
:::

But the question of origin is at first confounded with the question of
essence. It may just as well be said that it presupposes an
onto-phenomenological question in the strict sense of that term. One
must know *what* writing *is* in order to ask---knowing what one is
talking about and what *the []{#calibre_link-897}question is*---where
and when writing begins. What is writing? How can it be identified? What
certitude of essence[]{#calibre_link-2411} must guide the empirical
investigation? Guide it in principle, for it is a necessary fact that
empirical investigation quickly activates reflexion upon
essence.^[]{#calibre_link-614}[1](#calibre_link-240){.nounder}^ It must
operate through "examples," and it can be shown how this impossibility
of beginning at the beginning of the straight line, as it is assigned by
the logic of transcendental reflexion, refers to the originarity (under
erasure) of[]{#calibre_link-2412} the trace, to the root of writing.
What the thought of the trace has already taught us is that it could not
be simply submitted to the onto-phenomenological question of essence.
The trace *is nothing*, it is not an entity, it exceeds the question
*What is?* and contingently makes it possible. Here one may no longer
trust even the opposition of fact and principle, which, in all its
metaphysical, ontological,[]{#calibre_link-2413} and transcendental
forms, has always functioned within the system of *what is*. Without
venturing up to the perilous necessity of the question on the
arche-question "what is," let us take shelter in the field of
grammatological knowledge.

Writing being thoroughly historical, it is at once natural and
surprising that the scientific interest in writing has always taken the
form of a history of writing.[]{#calibre_link-2414} But science also
required that a theory of writing should guide the pure description of
facts, taking for granted that this last expression has a sense.

#### ***Algebra: Arcanum and Transparence*** {#calibre_link-19 .h3}

The extent to which the eighteenth century, here marking a break-off
point, attempted to comply with these two exigencies, is too often
ignored or underestimated. If for profound and systematic reasons, the
nineteenth[]{#calibre_link-2415} century has left us a heavy heritage of
illusions or misunderstandings, all that concerns the theory of the
written sign at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth
centuries has suffered the
consequences.^[]{#calibre_link-615}[2](#calibre_link-241){.nounder}^

We must learn to reread what has been thus confused for us. Madeleine
V.-David, one of those scholars who, in France, have untiringly kept
alive the historical investigations of[]{#calibre_link-2416} writing by
watching over the philosophical
question,^[]{#calibre_link-616}[3](#calibre_link-242){.nounder}^ has
just collected in a valuable work the pieces essential for a dossier: of
a debate exciting the passions of all European minds at the end of the
seventeenth and all through the eighteenth centuries. A blinding and
misunderstood symptom of the crisis of European consciousness. The first
plans for a "general history of writing"
(Warburton's[]{#calibre_link-2417} expression, dating from
1742)^[]{#calibre_link-617}[4](#calibre_link-243){.nounder}^ were born
in a milieu of thought where proper scientific work had constantly to
overcome the very thing that moved it: speculative prejudice and
ideological presumption. Critical work progresses by stages and its
entire strategy can be reconstructed after the fact. It first sweeps
away the *"theological"* prejudice; it is thus that Fréret qualifies the
myth of []{#calibre_link-881}a primitive[]{#calibre_link-2418} and
natural writing given by God, as Hebrew script was for Blaise de
Vigenère; in his *Traité des chiffres ou secrètes manières d'escrire*
(1586), he says of these characters that they are "the most ancient of
all, formed indeed by the Lord God's own
finger."[]{#calibre_link-1144}[\*](#calibre_link-244){.nounder} In all
its forms, overt or covert, this theologism, which is actually something
other and more than prejudice, constituted the major
obstacle[]{#calibre_link-2419} to all grammatology. No history of
writing could come to terms with it. And especially no history of the
very script of those whom this theologism blinded: the alphabet, whether
Greek or Hebrew. The element of the science of writing had to remain
invisible within its history, and especially to those who could perceive
the history of other scripts. Thus there is nothing surprising in the
fact[]{#calibre_link-2420} that the necessary decentering followed the
becoming-legible of nonoccidental scripts. The history of the alphabet
is accepted only after recognizing the multiplicity of the *systems* of
script and after assigning a history to them, whether or not one is in
the position to determine it scientifically.

This first decentering is, itself, limited. It is recentered upon
ahistorical grounds which, in[]{#calibre_link-2421} an analogous way,
reconcile the logico-philosophical (blindness to the condition of the
logico-philosophical: phonetic writing) and the theological points of
view.^[]{#calibre_link-618}[5](#calibre_link-245){.nounder}^ It is the
*"Chinese"* prejudice; all the philosophical projects of a universal
script and of a universal language, pasilaly, polygraphy, invoked by
Descartes, outlined by Father Kircher,
Wilkins,^[]{#calibre_link-619}[6](#calibre_link-246){.nounder}^ Leibniz,
etc., encouraged seeing in[]{#calibre_link-2422} the recently discovered
Chinese script a model of the philosophical language thus removed from
history. Such at any rate is the *function* of the Chinese model in
Leibniz's projects. For him what liberates Chinese script from the voice
is also that which, arbitrarily and by the artifice of invention,
wrenches it from history and gives it to philosophy.

The philosophical exigency that guided Leibniz[]{#calibre_link-2423} had
been formulated quite a few times before him. Among all who inspired
him, Descartes himself comes first. Replying to Mersenne, who had sent
him (from a publication unknown to us) an advertisement boasting a
system of six propositions for a universal language, Descartes begins by
declaring all his
distrust.^[]{#calibre_link-620}[7](#calibre_link-247){.nounder}^ He
considers with disdain certain propositions which were, according to
him, no more[]{#calibre_link-2424} than "sales talk" and "sales pitch."
And he has a "bad opinion of the word 'arcanum':" "as soon as I see the
word *arcanum* (mystery) in any proposition I begin to suspect it." To
this project he opposes arguments that are, one will
recall,^[]{#calibre_link-621}[8](#calibre_link-248){.nounder}^ those of
Saussure:

... \[the\] discordant combinations of letters which would often make
the sounds unpleasant and intolerable to the ear. It is to remedy
this[]{#calibre_link-2425} defect that all the differences in inflexions
of words have been introduced by usage; and it is
[]{#calibre_link-991}impossible for your author to have avoided the
difficulty while making his grammar universal among different nations;
for what is easy and pleasant in our language is coarse and intolerable
to Germans, and so on.

This language would, in addition, require that the "primitive words" of
all languages[]{#calibre_link-2426} be learnt; "this is too burdensome."

Except for communicating them "through writing." And it is an advantage
that Descartes does not fail to recognize:

It is true that if each man uses as primitive words the words of his own
language, he will not have much difficulty, but in that case he will be
understood only by the people of his own country unless he writes down
what he wants to say and the[]{#calibre_link-2427} person who wants to
understand him takes the trouble to look up all the words in the
dictionary; and this is too burdensome to become a regular practice. ...
So the only possible benefit that I see from his invention would be in
the case of the written word. Suppose he had a big dictionary printed of
all the languages in which he wanted to make himself understood and put
for each word a symbol corresponding[]{#calibre_link-2428} to the
meaning and not to the syllables, a single symbol, for instance, for
*aimer, amare*, and *philein:* then those who had the dictionary and
knew his grammar could translate what was written into their own
language by looking up each symbol in turn. But this would be no good
except for reading mysteries and revelations; in other cases no-one who
had anything better to do would take the trouble[]{#calibre_link-2429}
to look up all these words in a dictionary. So I do not see that all
this has much use. Perhaps I am wrong.

And with a profound irony, more profound perhaps than ironical,
Descartes opines that error may also result through a possible cause
other than non-self-evidence, failure of attention, or an over-hasty
will: a *fault of reading*. The value of a system of language or writing
is not measured[]{#calibre_link-2430} by the yardstick of intuition, of
the clarity or the distinction of the idea, or of the presence of the
object as evidence. The system must itself be *deciphered:*

Perhaps I am wrong; I just wanted to write to you all I could conjecture
on the basis of the six propositions which you sent me. When you have
seen the system, you will be able to say if I worked it out correctly
*\[déchiffrée\]*.

The profundity[]{#calibre_link-2431} draws the irony further than it
would go if it merely *followed its author*. Further perhaps than the
foundation of Cartesian certitude.

After which, in the form of note and postscript, Descartes defines the
Leibnizian project very simply. It is true that he sees the story of
philosophy there; only philosophy may write it, for philosophy depends
on it totally, but by the same token, it can never[]{#calibre_link-2432}
hope "to see such a language in use."

[]{#calibre_link-2433}The discovery of such a language depends upon the
true philosophy. For without that philosophy it is impossible to number
and order all the thoughts of men or even to separate them out into
clear and simple thoughts, which in my opinion is the great secret for
acquiring true scientific knowledge. ... I think it is possible to
invent such a language and to discover[]{#calibre_link-2434} the science
on which it depends: it would make \[even\] peasants better judges of
the truth about the world than philosophers are now. But do not hope
ever to see such a language in use. For that, the order of nature would
have to change so that the world turned into a terrestial paradise; and
that is too much to suggest outside of
fairyland.^[]{#calibre_link-622}[9](#calibre_link-249){.nounder}^

Leibniz expressly refers to this letter and to the
*[]{#calibre_link-2435}analytical* principle it formulates. The entire
project implies the decomposition into simple ideas. It is the only way
to substitute calculation for reasoning. In that sense, the universal
characteristic depends on philosophy for its principle but it may be
undertaken without waiting for the completion of philosophy:

However, although this language depends on the true philosophy, it does
not depend[]{#calibre_link-2436} on its perfection. In other words, this
language can be established even if philosophy is not perfect; and as
man's knowledge grows, this language will grow as well. Meanwhile it
will be a great help---for using what we know, for finding out what we
lack, for inventing ways of redeeming the lack, but especially for
settling controversies in matters that depend on reasoning. For then
reasoning[]{#calibre_link-2437} and calculating will be the same
thing.^[]{#calibre_link-623}[10](#calibre_link-250){.nounder}^

To be sure, these are not the only corrections of the Cartesian
tradition. Descartes's analyticism is intuitionist, that of Leibniz
points beyond manifest evidence, toward order, relation, point of
view.^[]{#calibre_link-624}[11](#calibre_link-251){.nounder}^

The characteristic economizes on the spirit and the imagination, whose
expense must always be husbanded. It is the principal goal of this great
science[]{#calibre_link-2438} that I am used to calling
*Characteristic*, of which what we call Algebra, or Analysis, is only a
small branch; for it is this science that gives speech to languages,
letters to speech, numbers to arithmetic, notes to music; it teaches us
the secret of stabilizing reasoning, and of obliging it to leave visible
marks on the paper in a little volume, to be examined at leisure:
finally, it makes us[]{#calibre_link-2439} reason at little cost,
putting characters in the place of things in order to ease the
imagination.^[]{#calibre_link-625}[12](#calibre_link-252){.nounder}^

In spite of all the differences that separate the projects of universal
language or writing at this time (notably with respect to history and
language),^[]{#calibre_link-626}[13](#calibre_link-253){.nounder}^ the
concept of the simple absolute is always necessarily and indispensably
involved. It would be easy to show that it always leads to an
infinitist[]{#calibre_link-2440} theology and to the logos or the
infinite understanding of
God.^[]{#calibre_link-627}[14](#calibre_link-254){.nounder}^ That is
why, appearances to the contrary, and in spite of all the seduction that
it can legitimately exercise on our epoch, the Leibnizian project of a
universal characteristic that is not essentially phonetic does not
interrupt logocentrism in any way. On the contrary, universal logic
confirms logocentrism, []{#calibre_link-853}is produced within
it[]{#calibre_link-2441} and with its help, exactly like the Hegelian
critique to which it will be subjected. I emphasize the complicity of
these two contradictory movements. Within a certain historical epoch,
there is a profound unity among infinitist theology, logocentrism, and a
certain technicism. The originary and pre- or meta-phonetic writing that
I am attempting to conceive of here leads to nothing less than an
"overtaking"[]{#calibre_link-2442} of speech by the machine.

In an original and non-"relativist" sense, logocentrism is an
ethnocentric metaphysics. It is related to the history of the West. The
Chinese model only apparently interrupts it when Leibniz refers to it to
teach the Characteristic. Not only does this model remain a domestic
representation,^[]{#calibre_link-628}[15](#calibre_link-255){.nounder}^
but also, it is praised only for the purpose of designating a lack and
to define[]{#calibre_link-2443} the necessary corrections. What Leibniz
is eager to borrow from Chinese writing is its arbitrariness and
therefore its independence with regard to history. This arbitrariness
has an essential link with the nonphonetic essence which Leibniz
believes he can attribute to Chinese writing. The latter seems to have
been "invented by a deaf man" (*New Essays):*

*Loqui* est voce articulata signum dare
cogitationis[]{#calibre_link-2444} suae. *Scribere* est id facere
permanentibus, in charta ductibus. Quos ad vocem referri non est
necesse, ut apparet ex Sinensium characteribus (*Opuscules*, p.
497).[]{#calibre_link-1146}[\*](#calibre_link-256){.nounder}

Elsewhere:

There are perhaps some artificial languages which are wholly of choice
and entirely arbitrary, as that of China is believed to have been, or as
those of George Dalgarno and the late Mr. Wilkins, bishop of
Chester.^[]{#calibre_link-629}[16](#calibre_link-257){.nounder}^

In[]{#calibre_link-2445} a letter to Father Bouvet (1703), Leibniz is
bent on distinguishing the Egyptian, popular, sensory, allegorical
writing from the Chinese, philosophical, and intellectual writing:

... Chinese characters are perhaps more philosophical and seem to be
built upon more intellectual considerations, such as are given by
numbers, orders, and relations; thus there are only detached strokes
that do not culminate[]{#calibre_link-2446} in some resemblances to a
sort of body.

This does not prevent Leibniz from promising a script for which the
Chinese would be only a blueprint:

This sort of plan would at the same time yield a sort of universal
script, which would have the advantages of the Chinese script, for each
person would understand it in his own language, but which would
infinitely surpass the Chinese, []{#calibre_link-832}in that it
would[]{#calibre_link-2447} be teachable in a few weeks, having
characters perfectly linked according to the order and connection of
things, whereas, since Chinese script has an infinite number of
characters according to the variety of things, it takes the Chinese a
lifetime to learn their script
adequately.^[]{#calibre_link-630}[17](#calibre_link-258){.nounder}^

The concept of Chinese writing thus functioned as a sort of European
hallucination. This implied nothing fortuitous:[]{#calibre_link-2448}
this functioning obeyed a rigorous necessity. And the hallucination
translated less an ignorance than a misunderstanding. It was not
disturbed by the knowledge of Chinese script, limited but real, which
was then available.

At the same time as the "Chinese prejudice," a *"hieroglyphist
prejudice"* had produced the same effect of interested blindness. The
occultation, far from proceeding, as it would[]{#calibre_link-2449}
seem, from ethnocentric scorn, takes the form of an hyperbolical
admiration. We have not finished verifying the necessity of this
pattern. Our century is not free from it; each time that ethnocentrism
is precipitately and ostentatiously reversed, some effort silently hides
behind all the spectacular effects to consolidate an inside and to draw
from it some domestic benefit. The astonishing
Father[]{#calibre_link-2450} Kircher thus devoted his entire genius to
opening the West to
Egyptology,^[]{#calibre_link-631}[18](#calibre_link-259){.nounder}^ but
the very excellence that he recognized in a "sublime" script forbade any
scientific deciphering of it. Evoking the *Prodromus coptus sive
aegyptiacus* (1636), M. V.-David writes:

This work is, in some of its parts, the first manifesto of Egyptological
research, since in it the author determines the *nature of the
ancient[]{#calibre_link-2451} Egyptian language*---the instrument of
discovery having been furnished him from
elsewhere.[]{#calibre_link-1148}[\*](#calibre_link-260){.nounder} The
same book however pushes aside all projects of deciphering the
hieroglyphs. []{#calibre_link-1150}[\*](#calibre_link-261){.nounder} cf.
*Lingua aegyptiaca
restituta.^[]{#calibre_link-632}[19](#calibre_link-262){.nounder}^*

Here the process of nonrecognition through assimilation is not, as in
Leibniz, of a rationalistic and calculating kind. It is mystical:

According to the *Prodromus*, hieroglyphs are indeed
a[]{#calibre_link-2452} script, but not a script composed of letters,
words, and determined parts of speech that we generally use. They are a
far finer and more sublime script, closer to abstractions, which, by an
ingenious linking of symbols, or its equivalent, proposes *at once (uno
intuitu*) to the intelligence of the scholar a complex reasoning,
elevated notions, or some mysterious insignia hidden in the breast
of[]{#calibre_link-2453} nature or the
Divinity.^[]{#calibre_link-633}[20](#calibre_link-263){.nounder}^

Between rationalism and mysticism there is, then, a certain complicity.
The writing of the other is each time invested with a domestic outline.
What one might, following Bachelard, call an "epistemological breach,"
is brought about above all by Fréret and Warburton. One can make out the
laborious process of disentanglement by which both prepared their
decision, the former[]{#calibre_link-2454} using the Chinese and the
latter the Egyptian example. []{#calibre_link-835}With much respect for
Leibniz and the project for a universal script, Fréret cuts to pieces
the representation of the Chinese script that is implied therein:
"Chinese script is indeed not a philosophical language which leaves
nothing to be desired. ... The Chinese have never had anything like
it."^[]{#calibre_link-634}[21](#calibre_link-264){.nounder}^

But, for all that, Fréret is not free of[]{#calibre_link-2455} the
hieroglyphist prejudice, which Warburton destroys by violently
criticizing Father
Kircher.^[]{#calibre_link-635}[23](#calibre_link-265){.nounder}^ The
apologetic purpose that animates this critique does not make it
ineffectual.

It is in the theoretical field thus liberated that the scientific
techniques of deciphering were perfected by the Abbé Barthélemey and
then by Champollion. Then a systematic reflection upon the
correspondence between[]{#calibre_link-2456} writing and speech could be
born. The greatest difficulty was already to conceive, in a manner at
once historical and systematic, the organized cohabitation, within the
same graphic code, of figurative, symbolic, abstract, and phonetic
elements.^[]{#calibre_link-636}[24](#calibre_link-266){.nounder}^

#### ***Science and the Name of Man*** {#calibre_link-20 .h3}

Had grammatology entered upon the assured path of a science? To be sure,
techniques of deciphering went on progressing[]{#calibre_link-2457} at
an accelerated
pace.^[]{#calibre_link-637}[25](#calibre_link-267){.nounder}^ But the
general histories of writing, wherein devotion to systematic
classification always oriented simple description, were to be governed
for a long time by theoretical concepts that are clearly not
commensurate with the great discoveries---discoveries that should have
shaken the most assured foundations of our philosophical conceptuality,
entirely commanded by a situation[]{#calibre_link-2458} determined by
the relationships between logos and writing. All the great histories of
writing open with an exposition of a classificatory and systematic
project. But today one could transpose to the domain of writing what
Jakobson says of languages since Schlegel's typological attempts:

... questions of typology retained a speculative, pre-scientific
character for a long time. While genetic grouping[]{#calibre_link-2459}
of languages made amazing progress, the time was not yet ripe for their
typological classification. (op. cit. p. 69)
[\*](#calibre_link-261){.nounder}

A systematic critique of the concepts used by historians of writing can
seriously blame the rigidity or the insufficient differentiation of a
theoretical apparatus only if it first locates the false evidence that
guides the work. Evidence all the more efficacious because it
belongs[]{#calibre_link-2460} to the deepest, the oldest, and apparently
the most natural, the least historical layer of our conceptuality, that
which best eludes criticism, and especially because it
[]{#calibre_link-844}supports that criticism, nourishes it, and informs
it; our historical ground itself.

In all histories or general typologies of writing may be encountered a
concession analogous to the one that made Father Berger, author, in
France,[]{#calibre_link-2461} of the first big *Histoire de l'écriture
dans l'antiquité* (1892), say: "Most often the facts do not conform to
the distinctions which ... are only exact in theory" (p. XX). Yet, the
issue was nothing less than the distinctions between phonetic and
ideographic, syllabic and alphabetic, scripts, between image and symbol,
etc. The same may be said of the instrumentalist and technicist concepts
of writing,[]{#calibre_link-2462} inspired by the phonetic model which
it does not conform to except through a teleological illusion, and which
the first contact with nonoccidental scripts ought to have demolished.
This instrumentalism is implicit everywhere. Nowhere is it as
systematically formulated, with all the attendant consequences, as by
Marcel Cohen: Language being an "instrument," writing is the "extension
to an
instrument."^[]{#calibre_link-638}[26](#calibre_link-268){.nounder}^[]{#calibre_link-2463}
The exteriority of writing to speech, of speech to thought, of the
signifier to the signified in general, could not be described better.
There is much food for thought in the matter of the price thus paid by a
linguistics---or by a grammatology---which, in this case, professes to
be Marxist, to the metaphysical tradition. But the same tribute may be
identified everywhere: logocentric teleology[]{#calibre_link-2464} (a
pleonastic expression); opposition between nature and institution; play
of differences between symbol, sign, image, etc., a naive concept of
representation; an uncritical opposition between sensible and
intelligible, between soul and body; an objectivist concept of the body
proper *\[corps propre\]* and of the diversity of sensory functions (the
"five senses" considered as so many apparatuses at[]{#calibre_link-2465}
the disposition of the speaker or writer); opposition between analysis
and synthesis, abstract and concrete, which plays a decisive role in the
classifications proposed by Février and Cohen and in the debate that
opposes them; a concept of the concept upon which the most classical
philosophic reflection has left little mark; a reference to
consciousness and to the unconscious which would
necessarily[]{#calibre_link-2466} invoke a more vigilant use of these
notions and some consideration for those studies that make these notions
their theme;^[]{#calibre_link-639}[27](#calibre_link-269){.nounder}^ a
notion of the sign that philosophy, linguistics, and semiology
illuminate rarely and feebly. The competition between the history of
writing and the science of language is sometimes experienced in terms of
hostility rather than collaboration. Supposing, of course, that
the[]{#calibre_link-2467} competition is admitted. Thus, a propos of the
great distinction operated by Février between "synthetic writing" and
"analytic writing," as also a propos of the "word" which plays for him a
central role, the author notes: "The problem is of the order of
linguistics, we shall not deal with it here" (op. cit., p. 49).
Elsewhere, the noncommunication with linguistics is justified by Février
in these[]{#calibre_link-2468} terms:

[]{#calibre_link-898}\[Mathematics\] is a special language which no
longer has any relationship with language, it is a sort of universal
language, that is to say we ascertain through mathematics that
language---vengeance upon linguists---is absolutely incapable of
accommodating certain forms of modern thought. And at present it is
writing, so badly misunderstood, that takes the place of language, after
having been[]{#calibre_link-2469} its servant (*EP*, p. 349).

It can be shown that these presuppositions and all the oppositions thus
accredited form a system: we circulate from one to the other within the
same structure.

Not only does the theory of writing need an intrascientific and
epistemological liberation, analogous to the one brought about by Fréret
and Warburton, without touching the layers of which we speak there.
Now[]{#calibre_link-2470} a reflection must clearly be undertaken,
within which the "positive" discovery and the "deconstruction" of the
history of metaphysics, in all its concepts, are controlled
reciprocally, minutely, laboriously. Without this, any epistemological
liberation would risk being illusory or limited, proposing merely
practical conveniences or notional simplifications on bases that are
untouched by criticism.[]{#calibre_link-2471} Such is undoubtedly the
limitation of the remarkable enterprise of I. J. Gelb (op. cit.); in
spite of immense progress and the project of erecting a grammatological
scientificity and creating a unified system of simple, supple, and
manageable notions, in spite of the exclusion of inadequate
concepts---such as of the ideogram---most of the conceptual oppositions
that I have just cited continue to function[]{#calibre_link-2472} there
securely.

Through all the recent work in the area, one glimpses the future
extensions of a grammatology called upon to stop receiving its guiding
concepts from other human sciences or, what nearly always amounts to the
same thing, from traditional metaphysics. A grammatology may be surmised
through the wealth and novelty of information, as well as through the
treatment of this information,[]{#calibre_link-2473} even if, in these
pioneering works, the conceptualization often falls short of a bold and
confident thrust.

What seems to announce itself now is, on the one hand, that grammatology
must not be one of the *sciences of man* and, on the other hand, that it
must not be just one *regional science* among others.

It ought not to be *one of the sciences of man*, because it asks first,
as its characteristic[]{#calibre_link-2474} question, the question of
the *name of man*. To free unity from the concept of man is undoubtedly
to renounce the old notion of peoples said to be "without writing" and
"without history." André Leroi-Gourhan shows it well; to refuse the name
of man and the ability to write beyond its own proper community, is one
and the same gesture. Actually, the peoples said to be "without writing"
lack only a[]{#calibre_link-2475} certain type of writing. To refuse the
name of writing to this or that technique of consignment is the
"ethnocentrism that best defines the prescientific vision of man" and at
the same time results in the fact that "in many human groups, the
[]{#calibre_link-2476}only word by which the members designate their
ethnic group is the word 'man'." (GP 11, pp. 32 and passim)

But it is not enough to denounce ethnocentrism[]{#calibre_link-2477} and
to define anthropological unity by the disposition of writing.
Leroi-Gourhan no longer describes the unity of man and the human
adventure thus by the simple possibility of the *graphie* in general;
rather as a stage or an articulation in the history of life---of what I
have called differance---as the history of the *gramm*è. Instead of
having recourse to the concepts that habitually serve to
distinguish[]{#calibre_link-2478} man from other living beings (instinct
and intelligence, absence or presence of speech, of society, of economy,
etc. etc.), the notion of *program* is invoked. It must of course be
understood in the cybernetic sense, but cybernetics is itself
intelligible only in terms of a history of the possibilities of the
trace as the unity of a double movement of protention and retention.
This movement goes[]{#calibre_link-2479} far beyond the possibilities of
the "intentional consciousness." It is an emergence that makes the
*gramm*è appear *as such* (that is to say according to a new structure
of nonpresence) and undoubtedly makes possible the emergence of the
systems of writing in the narrow sense. Since "genetic inscription" and
the "short programmatic chains" regulating the behavior of the amoeba or
the annelid up to[]{#calibre_link-2480} the passage beyond alphabetic
writing to the orders of the logos and of a certain *homo sapiens*, the
possibility of the *gramm*è structures the movement of its history
according to rigorously original levels, types, and
rhythms.^[]{#calibre_link-640}[28](#calibre_link-270){.nounder}^ But one
cannot think them without the most general concept of the *grammè*. That
is irreducible and impregnable. If the expression ventured by
Leroi-Gourhan is accepted,[]{#calibre_link-2481} one could speak of a
"liberation of memory," of an exteriorization always already begun but
always larger than the trace which, beginning from the elementary
programs of so-called "instinctive" behavior up to the constitution of
electronic card-indexes and reading machines, enlarges differance and
the possibility of putting in reserve: it at once and in the same
movement constitutes and effaces so-called[]{#calibre_link-2482}
conscious subjectivity, its logos, and its theological attributes.

The history of writing is erected on the base of the history of the
*grammè* as an adventure of relationships between the face and the hand.
Here, by a precaution whose schema we must constantly repeat, let us
specify that the history of writing is not explained by what we believe
we know of the face and the hand, of the glance,[]{#calibre_link-2483}
of the spoken word, and of the gesture. We must, on the contrary,
disturb this familiar knowledge, and awaken a meaning of hand and face
in terms of that history. Leroi-Gourhan describes the slow
transformation of manual motricity which frees the audio-phonic system
for speech, and the glance and the hand for
writing.^[]{#calibre_link-641}[29](#calibre_link-271){.nounder}^ In all
these descriptions, it is difficult to avoid the mechanist,
technicist,[]{#calibre_link-2484} and teleological language at the very
moment when it is precisely a question of retrieving the origin and the
possibility of movement, of the machine, of the
[]{#calibre_link-2485}*techn*è, of orientation in general. In fact, it
is not difficult, it is essentially impossible. And this is true of all
discourse. From one discourse to another, the difference lies only in
the mode of inhabiting the interior of a
conceptuality[]{#calibre_link-2486} destined, or already submitted, to
decay. Within that conceptuality or already without it, we must attempt
to recapture the unity of gesture and speech, of body and language, of
tool and thought, before the originality of the one and the other is
articulated and without letting this profound unity give rise to
confusionism. These original significations must not be confused *within
the orbit* of[]{#calibre_link-2487} the system where they are opposed.
But to think the history of the system, its meaning and value must, in
an *exorbitant* way, be somewhere exceeded.

This representation of the *anthropos* is then granted: a precarious
balance linked to manual-visual
script.^[]{#calibre_link-642}[30](#calibre_link-272){.nounder}^ This
balance is slowly threatened. It is at least known that "no major
change" giving birth to "a man of the future" who will no longer
be[]{#calibre_link-2488} a "man," "can be easily produced without the
loss of the hand, the teeth, and therefore of the upright position. A
toothless humanity that would exist in a prone position using what limbs
it had left to push buttons with, is not completely
inconceivable."^[]{#calibre_link-644}[31](#calibre_link-273){.nounder}^

What always threatens this balance is confused with the very thing that
broaches the *linearity* of the symbol. We have seen that the
traditional[]{#calibre_link-2489} concept of time, an entire
organization of the world and of language, was bound up with it. Writing
in the narrow sense---and phonetic writing above all---is rooted in a
past of nonlinear writing. It had to be defeated, and here one can
speak, if one wishes, of technical success; it assured a greater
security and greater possibilities of capitalization in a dangerous and
anguishing world. But that[]{#calibre_link-2490} was not done *one
single time*. A war was declared, and a suppression of all that resisted
linearization was installed. And first of what Leroi-Gourhan calls the
"mythogram," a writing that spells its symbols pluri-dimensionally;
there the meaning is not subjected to successivity, to the order of a
logical time, or to the irreversible temporality of sound. This
pluri-dimensionality does not paralyze[]{#calibre_link-2491} history
within simultaneity, it corresponds to another level of historical
experience, and one may just as well consider, conversely, linear
thought as a reduction of history. It is true that another word ought
perhaps to be used; the word history has no doubt always been associated
with a linear scheme of the unfolding of presence, where the line
relates the final presence to the originary
presence[]{#calibre_link-2492} according to the straight line or the
circle. For the same reason, the pluri-dimensional symbolic structure is
not given within the category of the simultaneous. Simultaneity
coordinates two absolute presents, two points or instants of presence,
and it remains a linearist concept.

The concept of *linearization* is much more effective, faithful, and
intrinsic than those that are habitually used[]{#calibre_link-2493} for
classifying scripts and describing their history (pictogram, ideogram,
letter, etc.). Exposing more []{#calibre_link-819}than one prejudice,
particularly about the relationship between ideogram and pictogram,
about so-called graphic "realism," Leroi-Gourhan recalls the unity,
within the mythogram, of all the elements of which linear writing marks
the disruption: technics (particularly graphics), art,
religion,[]{#calibre_link-2494} economy. To recover the access to this
unity, to this other structure of unity, we must de-sediment "four
thousand years of linear
writing."^[]{#calibre_link-646}[32](#calibre_link-274){.nounder}^

The linear norm was never able to impose itself absolutely for the very
reasons that intrinsically circumscribed graphic phoneticism. We now
know them; these limits came into being at the same time as the
possibility of what they limited, they opened what[]{#calibre_link-2495}
they finished and we have already named them: discreteness, differance,
spacing. The production of the linear norm thus emphasized these limits
and marked the concepts of symbol and language. The process of
linearization, as Leroi-Gourhan describes it on a very vast historical
scale, and the Jakobsonian critique of Saussure's linearist concept,
must be thought of together. The "line" represents[]{#calibre_link-2496}
only a particular model, whatever might be its privilege. This model
*has become* a model and, as a model, it remains inaccessible. If one
allows that the linearity of language entails this vulgar and mundane
concept of temporality (homogeneous, dominated by the form of the now
and the ideal of continuous movement, straight or circular) which
Heidegger shows to be the intrinsic determining
concept[]{#calibre_link-2497} of all ontology from Aristotle to Hegel,
the meditation upon writing and the deconstruction of the history of
philosophy become inseparable.

The enigmatic model of the *line* is thus the very thing that philosophy
could not see when it had its eyes open on the interior of its own
history. This night begins to lighten a little at the moment when
linearity---which is not loss or absence but the
repression[]{#calibre_link-2498} of
pluri-dimensional^[]{#calibre_link-647}[33](#calibre_link-275){.nounder}^
symbolic thought---relaxes its oppression because it begins to sterilize
the technical and scientific economy that it has long favored. In fact
for a long time its possibility has been structurally bound up with that
of economy, of technics, and of ideology. This solidarity appears in the
process of thesaurization, capitalization, sedentarization,
hierarchization, of the formation[]{#calibre_link-2499} of ideology by
the class that writes or rather commands the
scribes.^[]{#calibre_link-648}[34](#calibre_link-276){.nounder}^ Not
that the massive reappearance of nonlinear writing interrupts this
structural solidarity; quite the contrary. But it transforms its nature
profoundly.

The end of linear writing is indeed the end of the
book,^[]{#calibre_link-649}[35](#calibre_link-277){.nounder}^ even if,
even today, it is within the form of a book that new writings---literary
or theoretical---allow themselves[]{#calibre_link-2500} to be, for
better or for worse, encased. It is less a question of confiding new
writings to the envelope of a book than of finally reading what wrote
itself between the lines in the volumes. That is why, beginning to write
without the line, one begins also to reread past writing according to a
different organization of space. If today the problem of reading
[]{#calibre_link-327}occupies the forefront of science,
it[]{#calibre_link-2501} is because of this suspense between two ages of
writing. Because we are beginning to write, to write differently, we
must reread differently.

For over a century, this uneasiness has been evident in philosophy, in
science, in literature. All the revolutions in these fields can be
interpreted as shocks that are gradually destroying the linear model.
Which is to say the *epic* model. What is thought[]{#calibre_link-2502}
today cannot be written according to the line and the book, except by
imitating the operation implicit in teaching modern mathematics with an
abacus. This inadequation is not *modern*, but it is exposed today
better than ever before. The access to pluridimensionality and to a
delinearized temporality is not a simple regression toward the
"mythogram;" on the contrary, it makes all the
rationality[]{#calibre_link-2503} subjected to the linear model appear
as another form and another age of mythography. The meta-rationality or
the meta-scientificity which are thus announced within the meditation
upon writing can therefore be no more shut up within a science of man
than conform to the traditional idea of science. In one and the same
gesture, they leave *man, science*, and the *line* behind.

Even less can this meditation[]{#calibre_link-2504} be contained within
the limits of a *regional science*.

#### ***The Rebus and the Complicity of Origins*** {#calibre_link-21 .h3}

Were it a graphology. And even a graphology renewed and fertilized by
sociology, history, ethnography, and psychoanalysis.

Since individual markings reveal the particularities of the mind of
those who write, the national markings should permit to a certain extent
researches into the particularities[]{#calibre_link-2505} of the
collective mind of
peoples.^[]{#calibre_link-650}[36](#calibre_link-278){.nounder}^

Such a cultural graphology, however legitimate its project might be, can
come into being and proceed with some certitude only when the more
general and fundamental problems have been elucidated; as to the
articulation of an individual and a collective *graphie*, of the graphic
"discourse"---so to speak---and the graphic "code," considered not from
the point of view[]{#calibre_link-2506} of the intention of
signification or of denotation, but of style and connotation; problems
of the articulation of graphic forms and of diverse substances, of the
diverse forms of graphic substances (materials: wood, wax, skin, stone,
ink, metal, vegetable) or instruments (point, brush, etc., etc.); as to
the articulation of the technical, economic, or historical levels (for
example, at the moment[]{#calibre_link-2507} when a graphic *system* is
constituted and at the moment, which is not necessarily the same, when a
graphic *style* is fixed); as to the limit and the sense of variations
in style within the system; as to all the investitures to which a
*graphie*, in form and substance, is submitted.

[]{#calibre_link-982}From this latter point of view, a certain privilege
should be given to research of the psychoanalytic type. In as
much[]{#calibre_link-2508} as it touches the originary constitution of
objectivity and of the value of the object---the constitution of *good*
and *bad* objects as categories that do not allow themselves to be
derived from a *theoretical* formal ontology and from a science of the
objectivity of the object in general---psychoanalysis is not a simple
regional science, although, as its name indicates, it is presented under
the heading[]{#calibre_link-2509} of psychology. That it adheres to this
title is certainly not a matter of indifference and hints at a certain
state of criticism and epistemology. Nevertheless, even if
psychoanalysis did not achieve the transcendentality---under
erasure---of the arche-trace, even if it remained a mundane science, its
generality would have a controlling meaning with regard to all local
science. Here I am quite obviously[]{#calibre_link-2510} thinking of
researches of the type undertaken by Melanie Klein. An example of it may
be found in the essay on *"The Role of the School in the Libidinal
Development of the
Child"^[]{#calibre_link-651}[37](#calibre_link-279){.nounder}^* which
evokes, from the clinical point of view, all the investments with which
the operations of reading and writing, the production and management of
the number, etc., are charged. To the extent that the
constitution[]{#calibre_link-2511} of ideal objectivity must essentially
pass through the written
signifier,^[]{#calibre_link-652}[38](#calibre_link-280){.nounder}^ no
theory of this constitution has the right to neglect the investments of
writing. These investments not only retain an opacity in the ideality of
the object, but permit the liberation of that ideality. It gives the
force without which an objectivity in general would not be possible. I
do not dissimulate the gravity of[]{#calibre_link-2512} such an
affirmation and the immense difficulty of the task thus assigned to both
the theory of objectivity and psychoanalysis. But the necessity is
commensurate with the difficulty.

It is in his very work that the historian of writing encounters this
necessity. His problems cannot be grasped except at the root of all
sciences. Reflection on the essence of mathematics, politics, economics,
religion,[]{#calibre_link-2513} technology, law, etc., communicates most
intimately with the reflection upon and the information surrounding the
history of writing. The continuous vein that circulates through all
these fields of reflection and constitutes their fundamental unity is
the problem of the phoneticization of writing. This phoneticization has
a history, no script is absolutely exempt from it, and the enigma of
this[]{#calibre_link-2514} evolution does not allow itself to be
dominated by the concept of history. To be sure, the latter appears at a
determined moment in the phoneticization of script and it presupposes
phoneticization in an essential way.

On this subject, what does the most massive, most recent, and least
contestable information teach us? First, that for structural or
essential reasons, a purely phonetic writing[]{#calibre_link-2515} is
impossible and has never finished reducing the nonphonetic. The
distinction between phonetic and nonphonetic writing, although
completely indispensable and legitimate, remains
[]{#calibre_link-146}very derivative with regard to what may be called a
synergy and a fundamental synesthesia. It follows that not only has
phoneticization never been omnipotent but also that it has always
already begun to undermine the[]{#calibre_link-2516} mute signifier.
"Phonetic" and "nonphonetic" are therefore never pure qualities of
certain systems of writing, they are the abstract characteristics of
typical elements, more or less numerous and dominant within all systems
of signification in general. Their importance owes less to their
quantitative distribution than to their structural organization. The
cuneiform, for example, is at the same time[]{#calibre_link-2517}
ideogrammatic and phonetic. And, indeed, one cannot say that each
graphic signifier belongs to such and such a class, the cuneiform code
playing alternately on two registers. In fact, each graphic form may
have a *double value*---ideographic and phonetic. And its phonetic value
can be simple or complex. The same signifier may have one or various
phonic values, it may be *homophonic* or *polyphonic*.
To[]{#calibre_link-2518} this general complexity of the system is added
yet another subtle recourse to categorical determinatives, to phonetic
complements useless in reading, to a very irregular punctuation. And
Labat shows that it is impossible to understand the system without going
through its
history.^[]{#calibre_link-653}[39](#calibre_link-281){.nounder}^

This is true of all systems of writing and does not depend upon what is
sometimes hastily considered to be levels[]{#calibre_link-2519} of
elaboration. Within the structure of a pictographic tale for example, a
representation-of-a-thing, such as a totemic blazon, may take the
symbolic value of a proper name. From that moment on, it can function as
apellation within other series with a phonetic
value.^[]{#calibre_link-654}[40](#calibre_link-282){.nounder}^ Its
stratification may thus become very complex and go beyond the empirical
*consciousness* linked to their immediate usage.
Going[]{#calibre_link-2520} beyond this real consciousness, the
structure of this signifier may continue to operate not only on the
fringes of the potential consciousness but according to the causality of
the unconscious.

Thus the name, especially the so-called proper name, is always caught in
a chain or a system of differences. It becomes an appellation only to
the extent that it may inscribe itself within a
figuration.[]{#calibre_link-2521} Whether it be linked by its origin to
the representations of things in space or whether it remains caught in a
system of phonic differences or social classifications apparently
released from ordinary space, the proper-ness of the name does not
escape spacing. Metaphor shapes and undermines the proper name. The
literal *\[propre\]* meaning does not exist, its "appearance" is a
necessary function---and[]{#calibre_link-2522} must be analyzed as
such---in the system of differences and metaphors. The absolute parousia
of the literal meaning, as the presence to the self of the logos within
its voice, in the absolute hearing-itself-speak, should be *situated* as
a function responding to an indestructible but relative necessity,
within a system that encompasses it. That amounts to *situating* the
metaphysics or the ontotheology[]{#calibre_link-2523} of the logos.

[]{#calibre_link-834}The problem of the picture-puzzle (*rébus à
transfert*) brings together all the difficulties. As pictogram, a
representation of the thing may find itself endowed with a phonetic
value. This does not efface the "pictographic" reference which,
moreover, has never been simply "realistic." The signifier is broken or
constellated into a system: it refers at once, and at least, to a
thing[]{#calibre_link-2524} and to a sound. The thing is itself a
collection of things or a chain of differences "in space;" the sound,
which is also inscribed within a chain, may be a word; the inscription
is then ideogrammatical or synthetic, it cannot be decomposed; but the
sound may also be an atomic element itself entering into the
composition: we are dealing then with a script apparently pictographic
and in fact phonetico-analytical[]{#calibre_link-2525} in the same way
as the alphabet. What is now known of the writing of the Aztecs of
Mexico seems to cover all these possibilities.

Thus the proper name *Teocaltitlan* is broken into several syllables,
rendered by the following images: lips (*tentli*), road (*otlim*), house
(*calli*), and finally tooth (*tlanti*). The procedure is closely bound
up with that ... of suggesting the name of a person by
images[]{#calibre_link-2526} of the beings or things that go into the
making of his name. The Aztecs achieved a greater degree of phoneticism.
By having recourse to a truly phonetic analysis, they succeeded in
rendering separate sounds through
images.^[]{#calibre_link-655}[41](#calibre_link-283){.nounder}^

The work of Barthel and Knorosov\* on the Mayan glyphs do not lead to
harmonious results, their progress remains very slow, but the presence
of phonetic elements now seems[]{#calibre_link-2527} almost certain. And
the same is true of the writing of the Easter
Islands.^[]{#calibre_link-656}[42](#calibre_link-284){.nounder}^ Not
only is the latter picto-ideophonographic, but in the very interior of
its non-phonetic structures, equivocity and overdetermination can give
rise to metaphors taken over by a true *graphic rhetoric*, if this
absurd expression may be risked.

We shall now discover the complexity of this structure in the so-called
"primitive"[]{#calibre_link-2528} scripts and in cultures believed
"without writing." But we have known for a long time that largely
nonphonetic scripts like Chinese or Japanese included phonetic elements
very early. They remained structurally dominated by the ideogram or
algebra and we thus have the testimony of a powerful movement of
civilization developing outside of all logocentrism. Writing did not
reduce the voice[]{#calibre_link-2529} to itself, it incorporated it
into a system:

This script had more or less recourse to phonetic borrowings, certain
signs being used for their sound independently of their original
meaning. But this phonetic []{#calibre_link-2530}use of signs could
never become extensive enough to corrupt Chinese writing in principle
and lead it onto the path of phonetic notation. ... Writing in China,
never having *reached* a phonetic[]{#calibre_link-2531} analysis of
language, was never felt to be a more or less faithful transference
*\[décalque\]* of speech, and that is why the graphic sign, symbol of a
reality singular and unique like itself, has retained much of its
primitive prestige. There is no reason for believing that *in antiquity*
speech in China had not the same efficaciousness as writing, but it was
possible for its power to have been partly[]{#calibre_link-2532}
*eclipsed* by writing. On the contrary, in civilizations where writing
evolved toward syllabification and the alphabet early enough, it is the
word which concentrated in itself, definitively, all the powers of
religious and magical creation. And in fact it is remarkable that in
China this strange valorization of speech, word, syllable, or vowel,
attested in all great ancient civilizations from
the[]{#calibre_link-2533} Mediterranean basin to India, is not
encountered.^[]{#calibre_link-657}[43](#calibre_link-285){.nounder}^

It is difficult not to subscribe to this analysis globally. Let us note,
however, that it seems to consider "the phonetic analysis of language"
and phonetic writing as a normal "outcome," as an historical telos
*within sight* of which, like a ship steering to port, Chinese script
had to an extent run aground. Can it be thought that the
system[]{#calibre_link-2534} of Chinese script is thus a sort of
unfulfilled alphabet? On the other hand, Gernet seems to explain the
"primitive prestige" of Chinese graphism by its "symbolic" relationship
with a "reality singular and unique like itself." Is it not evident that
no signifier, whatever its substance and form, has a "unique and
singular reality?" A signifier is from the very beginning the
possibility of its own[]{#calibre_link-2535} repetition, of its own
image or resemblance. It is the condition of its ideality, what
identifies it as signifier, and makes it function as such, relating it
to a signified which, for the same reasons, could never be a "unique and
singular reality." From the moment that the sign appears, that is to say
from the very beginning, there is no chance of encountering anywhere the
purity of "reality," "unicity,"[]{#calibre_link-2536} "singularity." So
by what right can it be supposed that speech could have had, "in
antiquity," before the birth of Chinese writing, the sense and value
that we know in the West? Why would speech in China have had to be
"eclipsed" by writing? If one wishes really to penetrate to the thing
that, under the name of writing, separates much more than techniques of
notation, should one not get rid,[]{#calibre_link-2537} among other
ethnocentric presuppositions, also of a sort of graphic monogenetism
that transforms all differences into divergences or delays, accidents or
deviations? And examine this heliocentric concept of speech? As well as
the resemblance of the logos to the sun (to the good or to the death
that one cannot look at face to face), to the king or to the father (the
good or the intelligible sun[]{#calibre_link-2538} are compared to the
father in the *Republic*, 508 c)? What must writing be in order to
threaten this analogical system in its vulnerable and secret center?
What must it be in order to signify the *eclipse* of what is
[]{#calibre_link-892}*good* and of the *father?* Should one not stop
considering writing as the eclipse that comes to surprise and obscure
the glory of the word? And if there is some necessity of eclipse,
the[]{#calibre_link-2539} relationship of shadow and light, of writing
and speech, should it not itself appear in a different way?

In a different way: the necessary decentering cannot be a philosophic or
scientific act as such, since it is a question of dislocating, through
access to another system linking speech and writing, the founding
categories of language and the grammar of the *epistém*è. The natural
tendency of *[]{#calibre_link-2540}theory*---of what unites philosophy
and science in the *epistém*è---will push rather toward filling in the
breach than toward forcing the closure. It was normal that the
breakthrough was more secure and more penetrating on the side of
literature and poetic writing: normal also that it, like Nietzsche, at
first destroyed and caused to vacillate the transcendental authority and
dominant category of the *[]{#calibre_link-2541}epistém*è: being. This
is the meaning of the work of
Fenellosa^[]{#calibre_link-658}[44](#calibre_link-286){.nounder}^ whose
influence upon Ezra Pound and his poetics is wellknown: this irreducibly
graphic poetics was, with that of Mallarmé, the first break in the most
entrenched Western tradition. The fascination that the Chinese ideogram
exercised on Pound's writing may thus be given all its historical
significance.

Ever since phoneticization has[]{#calibre_link-2542} allowed itself to
be questioned in its origin, its history and its adventures, its
movement is seen to mingle with that of science, religion, politics,
economy, technics, law, art. The origins of these movements and these
historical regions dissociate themselves, as they must for the rigorous
delimitation of each science, only by an abstraction that one must
constantly be aware of and use with vigilance.[]{#calibre_link-2543}
This complicity of origins may be called arche-writing. What is lost in
that complicity is therefore the myth of the simplicity of origin. This
myth is linked to the very concept of origin; to speech reciting the
origin, to the myth of the origin and not only to myths of origin.

The fact that access to the written sign assures the sacred power of
keeping existence operative within the trace and[]{#calibre_link-2544}
of knowing the general structure of the universe; that all clergies,
exercising political power or not, were constituted at the same time as
writing and by the disposition of graphic power; that strategy,
ballistics, diplomacy, agriculture, fiscality, and penal law are linked
in their history and in their structure to the constitution of writing;
that the origin assigned to writing had
been---according[]{#calibre_link-2545} to the chains and
mythemes---always analogous in the most diverse cultures and that it
communicated in a complex but regulated manner with the distribution of
political power as with familial structure; that the possibility of
capitalization and of politico-administrative organization had always
passed through the hands of scribes who laid down the terms of many wars
and whose function was always[]{#calibre_link-2546} irreducible, whoever
the contending parties might be; that through discrepancies,
inequalities of development, the play []{#calibre_link-585}of
permanencies, of delays, of diffusions, etc., the solidarity among
ideological, religious, scientific-technical systems, and the systems of
writing which were therefore more and other than "means of
communication" or vehicles of the signified, remains indestructible;
that[]{#calibre_link-2547} the very sense of power and effectiveness in
general, which could appear as such, as meaning and mastery (by
idealization), only with so-called "symbolic" power, was always linked
with the disposition of writing; that economy, monetary or premonetary,
and graphic calculation were co-originary, that there could be no law
without the possibility of trace (if not, as H. Lévy-Bruhl shows, of
notation[]{#calibre_link-2548} in the narrow sense), all this refers to
a common and radical possibility that no determined science, no abstract
discipline, can think as
such.^[]{#calibre_link-659}[45](#calibre_link-287){.nounder}^

Indeed, one must understand this *incompetence* of science which is also
the incompetence of philosophy, the *closure* of the *epistém*è. Above
all it does not invoke a return to a prescientific or infra-philosophic
form of discourse. Quite the contrary.[]{#calibre_link-2549} This common
root, which is not a root but the concealment of the origin and which is
not common because it does not amount to the same thing except with the
unmonotonous insistence of difference, this unnameable movement of
*difference-itself*, that I have strategically nicknamed *trace,
reserve*, or *differance*, could be called writing only within the
*historical* closure, that is to say within the[]{#calibre_link-2550}
limits of science and philosophy.

The constitution of a science or a philosophy of writing is a necessary
and difficult task. But, a *thought* of the trace, of differance or of
reserve, having arrived at these limits and repeating them ceaselessly,
must also point beyond the field of the *epistém*è. Outside of the
economic and strategic reference to the name that Heidegger justifies
himself in giving[]{#calibre_link-2551} to an analogous but not
identical transgression of all philosophemes, *thought* is here for me a
perfectly neutral name, the blank part of the text, the necessarily
indeterminate index of a future epoch of differance. *In a certain
sense, "thought" means nothing*. Like all openings, this index belongs
within a past epoch by the face that is open to view. This thought has
no weight. It is, in the play[]{#calibre_link-2552} of the system, that
very thing which never has weight. Thinking is what we already know we
have not yet begun; measured against the shape of writing, it *is
broached* only in the *epistém*è.

Grammat*ology*, this thought, would still be walled-in within
presence.[]{#calibre_link-2553}

### []{#calibre_link-147 .calibre3}***Introduction to the "Age of Rousseau"*** {#calibre_link-23 .h2}

***In the voice we have an organ answering to hearing; we have no such
organ answering to sight, and we do not repeat colours as we repeat
sounds. This supplies an additional means of cultivating the ear by
practising the active and passive organs[]{#calibre_link-2557} one with
the other.---Emile***

If one had faith in the organization of a classical reading, one would
perhaps say that I had just proposed a double grid: *historical* and
*systematic*. Let us pretend to believe in this opposition. Let us do it
for the sake of convenience, for I hope that the reasons for my
suspicion are by now clear enough. Since I am about to deal with what,
using the same language and[]{#calibre_link-2558} with as much caution,
I call an *"example,"* I must now justify my choice.

Why accord an "exemplary" value to the "age of Rousseau"? What
privileged place does Jean-Jacques Rousseau occupy in the history of
logocentrism? What is meant by that proper name? And what are the
relationships between that proper name and the texts to which it was
underwritten? I do not profess to bring to these
questions[]{#calibre_link-2559} anything more than the beginning of an
answer, perhaps only the beginning of an elaboration, limited to the
preliminary organization of the question. This work will present itself
gradually. I cannot therefore justify it by way of anticipation and
preface. Let us nevertheless attempt an overture.

If the history of metaphysics is the history of a determination of being
as presence, if its adventure[]{#calibre_link-2560} merges with that of
logocentrism, and if it is produced wholly as the reduction of the
trace, Rousseau's work seems to me to occupy, between Plato's *Phaedrus*
and Hegel's *Encyclopaedia*, a singular position. What do these three
landmarks signify?

Between the overture and the philosophical accomplishment of phonologism
(or logocentrism), the motif of presence was decisively articulated. It
underwent[]{#calibre_link-2561} an internal modification whose most
conspicuous index was the moment of certitude in the Cartesian cogito.
Before that, the identity of presence offered to the mastery of
repetition was constituted under the "objective" form of the ideality of
the *eidos* or the substantiality of *ousia*. Thereafter, this
objectivity takes the form of *representation*, of the *idea* as the
modification of a self-present[]{#calibre_link-2562} substance,
conscious and certain of itself at the moment of its relationship to
itself. Within its most general form, the mastery of presence acquires a
sort of infinite assurance. The []{#calibre_link-823}power of repetition
that the *eidos* and *ousia* made available seems to acquire an absolute
independence. Ideality and substantiality relate to themselves, in the
element of the *res cogitans*, by a movement of
pure[]{#calibre_link-2563} auto-affection. Consciousness is the
experience of pure auto-affection. It calls itself infallible and if the
axioms of *natural reason* give it this certitude, overcome the
provocation of the Evil Spirit, and prove the existence of God, it is
because they constitute the very element of thought and of
self-presence. Self-presence is not disturbed by the divine origin of
these axioms. The infinite[]{#calibre_link-2564} alterity of the divine
substance does not interpose itself as an element of mediation or
opacity in the transparence of self-relationship and the purity of
auto-affection. God is the name and the element of that which makes
possible an absolutely pure and absolutely self-present self-knowledge.
From Descartes to Hegel and in spite of all the differences that
separate the different places and moments[]{#calibre_link-2565} in the
structure of that epoch, God's infinite understanding is the other name
for the logos as self-presence. The logos can be infinite and
self-present, it can be *produced as auto-affection*, only through the
*voice:* an order of the signifier by which the subject takes from
itself into itself, does not borrow outside of itself the signifier that
it emits and that affects it at the same time.
Such[]{#calibre_link-2566} is at least the experience---or
consciousness---of the voice: of hearing (understanding)-oneself-speak
*\[s'entendre-parler\]*. That experience lives and proclaims itself as
the exclusion of writing, that is to say of the invoking of an
"exterior," "sensible," "spatial" signifier interrupting self-presence.

Within this age of metaphysics, between Descartes and Hegel, Rousseau is
undoubtedly the only[]{#calibre_link-2567} one or the first one to make
a theme or a system of the reduction of writing profoundly implied by
the entire age. He repeats the inaugural movement of the *Phaedrus* and
of *De interpretatione* but starts from a new model of presence: the
subject's self-presence within *consciousness* or *feeling*. What he
excluded more violently than others must, of course, have fascinated and
tormented him more than[]{#calibre_link-2568} it did others. Descartes
had driven out the sign---and particularly the written sign---from the
cogito and from clear and distinct evidence; the latter being the very
presence of the idea to the soul, the sign was an accessory abandoned in
the region of the senses and of the imagination. Hegel reappropriates
the sensible sign to the movement of the Idea. He criticizes Leibniz and
praises phonetic writing[]{#calibre_link-2569} within the horizon of an
absolutely self-present logos, remaining close to itself within the
unity of its speech and its concept. But neither Descartes nor Hegel
grappled with the problem of writing. The place of this combat and
crisis is called the eighteenth century. Not only because it restores
the rights of sensibility, the imagination, and the sign, but because
attempts of the Leibnizian[]{#calibre_link-2570} type had opened a
breach within logocentric security. We must bring to light what it was
that, right []{#calibre_link-996}from the start, within these attempts
at a universal characteristic, limited the power and extent of the
breakthrough. Before Hegel and in explicit terms, Rousseau condemned the
universal characteristic; not because of the theological foundation
which ordained its possibility for the infinite
understanding[]{#calibre_link-2571} or logos of God, but because it
seemed to suspend the voice. "Through" this condemnation can be read the
most energetic eighteenth-century *reaction* organizing the defense of
phonologism and of logocentric metaphysics. What threatens is indeed
writing. It is not an accidental and haphazard threat; it reconciles
within a single historical system the projects of *pasigraphy*, the
discovery of non-European[]{#calibre_link-2572} scripts, or at any rate
the massive progress of the techniques of *deciphering*, and finally the
idea of a *general science of language and writing*. Against all these
pressures, a battle is then declared. "Hegelianism" will be its finest
scar.

The names of authors or of doctrines have here no substantial value.
They indicate neither identities nor causes. It would be frivolous to
think that "Descartes,"[]{#calibre_link-2573} "Leibniz," "Rousseau,"
"Hegel," etc., are names of authors, of the authors of movements or
displacements that we thus designate. The indicative value that I
attribute to them is first the name of a problem. If I provisionally
authorize myself to treat this historical structure by fixing my
attention on philosophical or literary texts, it is not for the sake of
identifying in them the origin,[]{#calibre_link-2574} cause, or
equilibrium of the structure. But as I also do not think that these
texts are the simple *effects* of structure, in any sense of the word;
as I think that *all concepts hitherto proposed in order to think the
articulation of a discourse and of an historical totality are caught
within the metaphysical closure that I question here*, as we do not know
of any other concepts and cannot produce[]{#calibre_link-2575} any
others, and indeed shall not produce so long as this closure limits our
discourse; as the primordial and indispensable phase, in fact and in
principle, of the development of this problematic, consists in
questioning the internal structure of these texts as symptoms; as that
is the only condition for determining these symptoms *themselves* in the
totality of their metaphysical appurtenance; I[]{#calibre_link-2576}
draw my argument from them in order to isolate Rousseau, and, in
Rousseauism, the theory of writing. Besides, this abstraction is partial
and it remains, in my view, provisional. Further on, I shall directly
approach the problem within a "question of method."

Beyond these broad and preliminary justifications, other urgencies
should be invoked. In Western and notably French thought, the
dominant[]{#calibre_link-2577} discourse---let us call it
"structuralism"---remains caught, by an entire layer, sometimes the most
fecund, of its stratification, within the
metaphysics---logocentrism---which at the same time one claims rather
precipitately to have "gone beyond." If I have chosen the example of the
texts of Claude Lévi-Strauss, as points of departure and as a
springboard for a reading of []{#calibre_link-2578}Rousseau, it is for
more than[]{#calibre_link-2579} one reason; for the theoretical wealth
and interest of those texts, for the animating role that they currently
play, but also for the place occupied in them by the theory of writing
and the theme of fidelity to Rousseau. They will, therefore, in this
study, be somewhat more than an exergue.

Metaphysics has constituted an exemplary system of defense against the
threat of writing. What links writing to violence? What must violence be
in order for something in it to be equivalent to the operation of the
trace?

And why bring this question into play within the affinity or filiation
that binds Lévi-Strauss to Rousseau? Another difficulty is added to the
problem of the justification of[]{#calibre_link-2583} this historical
contraction; what is a lineage in the order of discourse and text? If in
a rather conventional way I call by the name of *discourse* the present,
living, conscious *representation* of a *text* within the experience of
the person who writes or reads it, and if the text constantly goes
beyond this representation by the entire system of its resources and its
own laws, then the question[]{#calibre_link-2584} of genealogy exceeds
by far the possibilities that are at present given for its elaboration.
We know that the metaphor that would describe the genealogy of a text
correctly is still *forbidden*. In its syntax and its lexicon, in its
spacing, by its punctuation, its lacunae, its margins, the historical
appurtenance of a text is never a straight line. It is neither causality
by contagion, nor the[]{#calibre_link-2585} simple accumulation of
layers. Nor even the pure juxtaposition of borrowed pieces. And if a
text always gives itself a certain representation of its own roots,
those roots live only by that representation, by never touching the
soil, so to speak. Which undoubtedly destroys their *radical essence*,
but not the necessity of their *racinating function*. To say that one
always interweaves roots endlessly,[]{#calibre_link-2586} bending them
to send down roots among the roots, to pass through the
[]{#calibre_link-864}same points again, to redouble old adherences, to
circulate among their differences, to coil around themselves or to be
enveloped one in the other, to say that a text is never anything but a
*system of roots*, is undoubtedly to contradict at once the concept of
system and the pattern of the root. But in order not to be pure
appearance,[]{#calibre_link-2587} this contradiction takes on the
meaning of a contradiction, and receives its "illogicality," only
through being thought within a finite configuration---the history of
metaphysics---and caught within a root system which does not end there
and which as yet has no name.

The text's self-consciousness, the circumscribed discourse where
genealogical representation is articulated (what Lévi-Strauss,
for[]{#calibre_link-2588} example, makes of a certain "eighteenth
century," by quoting it as the source of his thought), without being
confused with genealogy itself, plays, precisely by virtue of this
divergence, an organizing role in the structure of the text. Even if one
did have the right to speak of retrospective illusion, it would not be
an accident or a theoretical falling off; one would have to account for
its necessity[]{#calibre_link-2589} and its positive effects. A text
always has several epochs and reading must resign itself to that fact.
And this genealogical self-representation is itself already the
representation of a self-representation; what, for example, "the French
eighteenth century," if such a thing existed, already constructed as its
own source and its own presence.

Is the play of these appurtenances, so manifest in[]{#calibre_link-2590}
texts of anthropology and the "sciences of man," produced totally within
a "history of metaphysics?" Does it somewhere force the closure? Such is
perhaps the widest horizon of the questions which will be supported by a
few examples here. To which proper names may be assigned: the sustainers
of the discourse, Condillac, Rousseau, Lévi-Strauss; or common names:
concepts of analysis, of genesis, of[]{#calibre_link-2591} origin, of
nature, of culture, of sign, of speech, of writing, etc.; in short, the
common name of the proper name.

In linguistics as well as in metaphysics, *phonologism* is undoubtedly
the exclusion or abasement of writing. But it is also the granting of
authority to a science which is held to be the model for all the
so-called sciences of man. In both these senses Lévi-Strauss's
structuralism[]{#calibre_link-2592} is a phonologism. As for the
"models" of linguistics and phonology, what I have already brought up
will not let me skirt around a structural anthropology upon which
phonological science exercises so *declared* a fascination, as for
instance in "Language and
Kinship";^[]{#calibre_link-660}[1](#calibre_link-290){.nounder}^ it must
be questioned line by line.

The advent of structural linguistics *\[phonologie\]* completely changed
this situation. Not only[]{#calibre_link-2593} did it renew linguistic
perspectives; a transformation of this []{#calibre_link-610}magnitude is
not limited to a single discipline. Structural linguistics will
certainly play the same renovating role with respect to the social
sciences that nuclear physics, for example, has played for the physical
sciences *\[l'ensemble des sciences exactes\]* (p. 39) \[p. 31\].

If we wished to elaborate the question of the *model*,
we[]{#calibre_link-2594} would have to examine all the "as"-s and
"likewise"-s that punctuate the argument, ordering and authorizing the
analogy between phonology and sociology, between phonemes and the terms
of kinship. "A striking analogy," we are told, but the functioning of
its "as" shows us quickly enough that this is a very infallible but very
impoverished generality of structural laws, no doubt governing the
systems[]{#calibre_link-2595} considered, but also dominating many other
systems without privilege; a phonology exemplary as the example in a
series and not as the regulative model. But on this terrain questions
have been asked, objections articulated; and as the *epistemological*
phonologism establishing a science as a master-model presupposes a
*linguistic* and *metaphysical* phonologism that raises speech above
writing, it is[]{#calibre_link-2596} this last that I shall first try to
identify.

For Lévi-Strauss has written of writing. Only a few pages, to be
sure^[]{#calibre_link-661}[2](#calibre_link-291){.nounder}^ but in many
respects remarkable; very fine pages, calculated to amaze, enunciating
in the form of paradox and modernity the anathema that the Western world
has obstinately mulled over, the exclusion by which it has constituted
and recognized itself, from the *Phaedrus* to the
*Course[]{#calibre_link-2597} in General Linguistics*.

Another reason for rereading Lévi-Strauss: if, as I have shown, writing
cannot be felt without an unquestioning faith in the entire system of
differences between *physis* and its other (the series of its "others:"
art, technology, law, institution, society, immotivation, arbitrariness,
etc.), and in all the conceptuality disposed within it, then one should
follow with the[]{#calibre_link-2598} closest attention the troubled
path of a thinker who sometimes, at a certain stage in his reflections,
bases himself on this difference, and sometimes leads us to its point of
effacement: "The opposition between nature and culture to which I
attached much importance at one time ... now seems to be of primarily
methodological
importance."^[]{#calibre_link-662}[3](#calibre_link-292){.nounder}^
Undoubtedly Lévi-Strauss has only traveled from one
point[]{#calibre_link-2599} of effacement to another. *Les structures
élémentaires de la parenté*
(1949),[]{#calibre_link-1154}[\*](#calibre_link-293){.nounder} dominated
by the problem of the prohibition of incest, already credited difference
only around a suture. As a result both the one and the other became all
the more enigmatic. And it would be risky to decide if the seam---the
prohibition of incest---is a strange exception that one happened to
encounter within the
[]{#calibre_link-2600}transparent[]{#calibre_link-2601} system of
difference, a "fact," as Lévi-Strauss says, with which "we are then
confronted" (p. 9) \[p. 8\]; or is rather the origin of the difference
between nature and culture, the condition---outside of the system---of
the system of difference. The condition would be a "scandal" only if one
wished to comprehend it *within* the system whose condition it precisely
is.

Let us suppose then that everything[]{#calibre_link-2602} universal in
man relates to the natural order, and is characterized by spontaneity,
and that everything subject to a norm is cultural and is both relative
and particular. We are then confronted with a fact, or rather, a group
of facts, which, in the light of previous definitions, are not far
removed from a scandal: ... \[for\] the prohibition of incest ...
presents, without the slightest ambiguity, and[]{#calibre_link-2603}
inseparably combines, the two characteristics in which we recognize the
conflicting features of two mutually exclusive orders. It constitutes a
rule, but a rule which, alone among all the social rules, possesses at
the same time a universal character (p. 9) \[pp. 8--9\].

But the "scandal" appeared only at a certain moment of the analysis; the
moment when, giving up a "real analysis" which will
never[]{#calibre_link-2604} reveal any difference between nature and
culture, one passed to an "ideal analysis" permitting the definition of
"the double criterion of norm and universality." It is thus from the
confidence placed in the difference between the two analyses that the
scandal took its scandalous meaning. What did this confidence signify?
It appeared to itself as the scholar's right to employ "methodological
tools"[]{#calibre_link-2605} whose "logical value" is anticipated, and
in a state of precipitation, with regard to the "object," to "truth,"
etc., with regard, in other words, to what science works toward. These
are the first words---or nearly so---of *Structures:*

It is beginning to emerge that this distinction between the state of
nature and the state of society (today I would rather say state of
nature and state of culture)[]{#calibre_link-2606} while of no
acceptable historical significance, does contain a logic, fully
justifying its use by modern sociology as a methodological tool (p. 1)
\[p. 3\].

This is clear: in regard to the "chiefly methodological value" of the
concepts of nature and culture, there is no evolution and even less
retraction from *Structures* to *The Savage Mind*. Nor is there either
evolution or retraction with regard[]{#calibre_link-2607} to this
concept of methodogical tool; *Structures* announces most precisely
what, more than a decade later, will be said of *"bricolage,"* of tools
such as "means" "collected or retained on the principle that 'they may
always come in handy.'" "Like *'bricolage'* on the technical plane,
mythical reflection can reach brilliant unforeseen results on the
intellectual plane. Conversely, attention has
often[]{#calibre_link-2608} been drawn to the mytho-poetical nature of
*'bricolage*' " (pp. 26 f.) \[pp. 17--18\]. To be sure, it would still
remain to be asked if the anthropologist considers himself
[]{#calibre_link-846}"engineer" or *"bricoleur." Le cru et le cuit*
\[Paris, 1964\] is presented as "the myth of mythology" ("Preface," p.
20).[]{#calibre_link-1156}[\*](#calibre_link-294){.nounder}

Nevertheless, the effacement of the frontier between nature and culture
is not produced by the same gesture[]{#calibre_link-2609} from
*Structures* to *The Savage Mind*. In the first case, it is rather a
question of respecting the originality of a scandalous suture. In the
second case, of a reduction, however careful it might be not to
"dissolve" the specificity of what it analyzes:

... it would not be enough to reabsorb particular humanities into a
general one. This first enterprise opens the way for others which
Rousseau \[whose[]{#calibre_link-2610} "usual acumen" Lévi-Strauss has
just praised\] would not have been so ready to accept and which are
incumbent on the exact natural sciences: the reintegration of culture in
nature and finally of life within the whole of its physiochemical
conditions (p. 327) \[p. 247\].

At once conserving and annulling inherited conceptual oppositions, this
thought, like Saussure's, stands on a borderline:
sometimes[]{#calibre_link-2611} within an uncriticized conceptuality,
sometimes putting a strain on the boundaries, and working toward
deconstruction.

Finally, why Lévi-Strauss *and* Rousseau? The quotation above
necessarily leads us to this question. This conjunction must be
justified gradually and intrinsically. But it is already known that
Lévi-Strauss not only feels himself to be *in agreement* with
Jean-Jacques, to be his[]{#calibre_link-2612} heir at heart and in what
might be called theoretical affect. He also often presents himself as
Rousseau's modern disciple; he reads Rousseau as the *founder*, not only
the prophet, of modern anthropology. A hundred texts glorifying Rousseau
may be cited. Nevertheless, let us recall, at the end of *Totémisme
aujourd'hui*, []{#calibre_link-1157}[†](#calibre_link-295){.nounder} the
chapter on "Totemism from Within:" "a ... militant fervor for
ethnography,"[]{#calibre_link-2613} the "astonishing insight" of
Rousseau who, "more prudent ... than Bergson" and "before even the
'discovery' of totemism "penetrate\[d\]" (p. 147) that which opens the
possibility of totemism in general, namely:

1\. *Pity*, that fundamental affection, as primitive as the love of
self, which unites us to others naturally: to other human beings,
certainly, but also to all living beings.

2\. The *originarily[]{#calibre_link-2614} metaphoric*---because it
belongs to the passions, says Rousseau---essence of our *language*. What
authorizes Lévi-Strauss's interpretation is the *Essay on the Origin of
Languages*, which we shall try to read closely later: "As man's first
motives for speaking were of the passions []{#calibre_link-2615}\[and
not of needs\], his first expressions were tropes. Figurative language
was the first to be born" \[p. 12\]. It is again
in[]{#calibre_link-2616} "Totemism from Within" that the second
*Discourse* is defined as "the first treatise of general anthropology in
French literature. In almost modern terms, Rousseau poses the central
problem of anthropology, viz., the passage from nature to culture" (p.
142) \[p. 99\]. And here is the most systematic homage: "Rousseau did
not merely foresee anthropology; he founded it. First in a practical
way, in[]{#calibre_link-2617} writing that *Discours sur l'origine et
les fondements de l'inégalité parmi les hommes* which poses the problem
of the relationships between nature and culture, and which is the first
treatise of general anthropology; and later on the theoretical plane, by
distinguishing, with admirable clarity and concision, the proper object
of the anthropologist from that of the moralist and the historian:
'When[]{#calibre_link-2618} one wants to study men, one must consider
those around one. But to study man, one must extend the range of one's
vision. One must first observe the differences in order to discover the
properties' (*Essay on the Origin of Languages*, Chapter VIII) \[pp.
30--31\]."^[]{#calibre_link-663}[4](#calibre_link-296){.nounder}^

It is therefore a declared and militant Rousseauism. Already it imposes
on us a very general question that will orient all our
readings[]{#calibre_link-2619} more or less directly: to what extent
does Rousseau's appurtenance to logocentric metaphysics and within the
philosophy of presence---an appurtenance that we have already been able
to recognize and whose exemplary figure we must delineate---to what
extent does it limit a scientific discourse? Does it necessarily retain
within its boundaries the Rousseauist discipline and fidelity of an
anthropologist[]{#calibre_link-2620} and of a theorist of modern
anthropology?

If this question is not sufficient to link the development which will
follow with my initial proposition, I should perhaps recapitulate:

1\. that digression about the violence that *does not supervene* from
without upon an innocent language in order to surprise it, a language
that suffers the aggression of writing as the accident of its disease,
its defeat[]{#calibre_link-2621} and its fall; but is the originary
violence of a language which is always already a writing. Rousseau and
Lévi-Strauss are not for a moment to be challenged when they relate the
power of writing to the exercise of violence. But radicalizing this
theme, no longer considering this violence as *derivative* with respect
to a naturally innocent speech, one reverses the entire sense of a
proposition---the[]{#calibre_link-2622} unity of violence and
writing---which one must therefore be careful not to abstract and
isolate.

2\. that other ellipsis of the metaphysics or onto-theology of the logos
(par excellence in its Hegelian moment) as the powerless and oneiric
effort to master absence by reducing the metaphor within the absolute
parousia of sense. Ellipsis of the originary writing within language as
the irreducibility[]{#calibre_link-2623} of metaphor, which it is
necessary here to think in its possibility and short of its rhetorical
repetition. The irremediable absence of the []{#calibre_link-883}proper
name. Rousseau no doubt believed in the figurative initiation of
language, but he believed no less, as we shall see, in a progress toward
literal (proper) meaning. "Figurative language was the first to be
born," he says, only to add, "proper meaning[]{#calibre_link-2624} was
discovered last"
(*Essay*).^[]{#calibre_link-664}[5](#calibre_link-297){.nounder}^ It is
to this eschatology of the *proper (prope, proprius*, self-proximity,
self-presence, property, own-ness) that we ask the question of the
*graphein*.

#### ***The Battle of Proper Names*** {#calibre_link-25 .h3}

***But how is one to distinguish, in writing, between a man one mentions
and a man one addresses. There really is an equivocation which would be
eliminated by a vocative mark.---Essay on the[]{#calibre_link-2625}
Origin of Languages***

Back now from *Tristes Tropiques* to the *Essay on the Origin of
Languages*, from "A Writing Lesson" given to the writing lesson refused
by the person who was "ashamed to toy" with the "trifl\[ing\]" matter of
writing in a treatise on education. My question is perhaps better stated
thus: do they say the same thing? Do they do the same thing?

In that *Tristes Tropiques* which is at[]{#calibre_link-2626} the same
time *The Confessions* and a sort of supplement to the *Supplément au
voyage de
Bougainville,[]{#calibre_link-1159}[\*](#calibre_link-298){.nounder}*
the "Writing Lesson" marks an episode of what may be called the
anthropological war, the essential confrontation that opens
communication between peoples and cultures, even when that communication
is not practiced under the banner of colonial or missionary oppression.
The entire "Writing Lesson"[]{#calibre_link-2627} is recounted in the
tones of violence repressed or deferred, a violence sometimes veiled,
but always oppressive and heavy. Its weight is felt in various places
and various moments of the *narrative:* in Lévi-Strauss's account as in
the relationship among individuals and among groups, among cultures or
within the same community. What can a relationship to writing signify in
these diverse instances[]{#calibre_link-2628} of violence?

Penetration in the case of the Nambikwara. The anthropologist's
affection for those to whom he devoted one of his dissertations, *La vie
familiale et sociale des Indiens Nambikwara* (1948). Penetration,
therefore, into "the lost world" of the Nambikwara, "the little bands of
nomads, who are among the most genuinely 'primitive' of the world's
peoples" on "a territory the size of France,"[]{#calibre_link-2629}
traversed by a *picada* (a crude trail whose "track" is "not easily
distinguished from the bush" \[p. 262\]; one should meditate upon all of
the following together: writing as the possibility of the road and of
difference, the history of writing and the history of the road, of the
rupture, of the *via rupta*, of the path that is broken, beaten,
*fracta*, of the space of reversibility and of
repetition[]{#calibre_link-2630} traced by the opening, the divergence
from, and []{#calibre_link-998}the violent spacing, of nature, of the
natural, savage, salvage, forest. The *silva* is savage, the *via rupta*
is written, discerned, and inscribed violently as difference, as form
imposed on the *hylè*, in the forest, in wood as matter; it is
difficult, to imagine that access to the possibility of a road-map is
not at the same time access to writing).[]{#calibre_link-2631} The
territory of the Nambikwara is crossed by the line of an autochthonic
picada. But also by another *line*, this time imported:

\[An abandoned telephone line\] obsolete from the day of its completion
\[which\] hung down from poles never replaced when they go to rot and
tumble to the ground. (Sometimes the termites attack them, and sometimes
the Indians, who mistake the humming of the telegraph
wires[]{#calibre_link-2632} for the noise of bees on their way to the
hive.) \[p. 262\]

The Nambikwara, whose tormenting and cruelty---presumed or not---are
much feared by the personnel of the line, "brought the observer back to
what he might readily, though mistakenly, suppose to be the childhood of
our race" \[p. 265\]. Lévi-Strauss describes the biological and cultural
type of this population whose technology, economy,
institutions,[]{#calibre_link-2633} and structures of kinship, however
primitive, give them of course a rightful place within humankind,
so-called human society and the "state of culture." They speak and
prohibit incest. "All were interrelated, for the Nambikwara prefer to
marry a niece (their sister's daughter), or a kinswoman of the kind
which anthropologists call 'cross-cousin': the daughter of their
father's sister, or[]{#calibre_link-2634} of their mother's brother"
\[p. 269\]. Yet another reason for not allowing oneself to be taken in
by appearances and for not believing that one sees here the "childhood
of our race:" the structure of the language. And above all its *usage*.
The Nambikwara use several dialects and several systems according to
situations. And here intervenes a phenomenon which may be crudely called
"linguistic" and[]{#calibre_link-2635} which will be of central interest
to us. It has to do with a *fact* that we have not the means of
interpreting beyond its general conditions of possibility, its a priori;
whose factual and empirical causes---as they open within this determined
situation---will escape us, and, moreover, call forth no question on the
part of Lévi-Strauss, who merely notes them. This fact bears on what we
have proposed[]{#calibre_link-2636} about the essence or the energy of
the *graphein* as the originary effacement of the proper name. From the
moment that the proper name is erased in a system, there is writing,
there is a "subject" from the moment that this obliteration of the
proper is produced, that is to say from the first appearing of the
proper and from the first dawn of language. This proposition is
universal in essence and[]{#calibre_link-2637} can be produced *a
priori*. How one passes from this *a priori* to the determination of
empirical facts is a question that one cannot answer in general here.
First because, by definition, there is no general answer to a question
of this form.

[]{#calibre_link-999}It is therefore such a *fact* that we encounter
here. It does not involve the structural effacement of what we believe
to be our proper names; it does not involve[]{#calibre_link-2638} the
obliteration that, paradoxically, constitutes the originary legibility
of the very thing it erases, but of a prohibition heavily superimposed,
in certain societies, upon the use of the proper name: "They are not
allowed ... to use proper names" \[p. 270\], Lévi-Strauss observes.

Before we consider this, let us note that this prohibition is
necessarily derivative with regard to the
constitutive[]{#calibre_link-2639} erasure of the proper name in what I
have called arche-writing, within, that is, the play of difference. It
is because the proper names are already no longer proper names, because
their production is their obliteration, because the erasure and the
imposition of the letter are originary, because they do not supervene
upon a proper inscription; it is because the proper name has never been,
as the[]{#calibre_link-2640} unique appellation reserved for the
presence of a unique being, anything but the original myth of a
transparent legibility present under the obliteration; it is because the
proper name was never possible except through its functioning within a
classification and therefore within a system of differences, within a
writing retaining the traces of difference, that the interdict was
possible, could come[]{#calibre_link-2641} into play, and, when the time
came, as we shall see, could be transgressed; transgressed, that is to
say restored to the obliteration and the non-self-sameness
*\[non-propriété\]* at the origin.

This is strictly in accord with one of Lévi-Strauss's intentions. In
"Universalization and Particularization" (*The Savage Mind*, Chapter VI)
it will be demonstrated that "one ... never names: one classes
someone[]{#calibre_link-2642} else ... \[or\] one classes
oneself."^[]{#calibre_link-665}[6](#calibre_link-299){.nounder}^ A
demonstration anchored in some examples of prohibitions that affect the
use of proper names here and there. Undoubtedly one should carefully
distinguish between the essential necessity of the disappearance of the
proper name and the determined prohibition which can, contingently and
ulteriorly, be added to it or articulated within it. Nonprohibition, as
much[]{#calibre_link-2643} as prohibition, presupposes fundamental
obliteration. Nonprohibition, the *consciousness* or exhibition of the
proper name, only makes up for or uncovers an essential and irremediable
impropriety. When within *consciousness*, the name *is called* proper,
it is already classified and is obliterated in *being named*. It is
already no more than a *so-called* proper name.

If writing is no longer understood[]{#calibre_link-2644} in the narrow
sense of linear and phonetic notation, it should be possible to say that
all societies capable of producing, that is to say of obliterating,
their proper names, and of bringing classificatory difference into play,
practice writing in general. No reality or concept would therefore
correspond to the expression "society without writing." This expression
is dependent on ethnocentric oneirism,[]{#calibre_link-2645} upon the
vulgar, that is to say ethnocentric, misconception of writing. The scorn
for writing, let us note in passing, accords quite happily with this
ethnocentrism. []{#calibre_link-148}The paradox is only apparent, one of
those contradictions where a perfectly coherent desire is uttered and
accomplished. By one and the same gesture, (alphabetic) writing, servile
instrument of a speech dreaming of its plenitude
and[]{#calibre_link-2646} its self-presence, is scorned and the dignity
of writing is refused to nonalphabetic signs. We have perceived this
gesture in Rousseau and in Saussure.

The Nambikwara---the *subject* of "A Writing Lesson"---would therefore
be one of these peoples without writing. They do not make use of what
*we* commonly call writing. At least that is what Lévi-Strauss tells us:
"That the Nambikwara could not write[]{#calibre_link-2647} goes without
saying" \[p. 288\]. This incapacity will be presently thought, within
the ethico-political order, as an innocence and a non-violence
interrupted by the forced entry of the West and the "Writing Lesson." We
shall be present at that scene in a little while.

How can access to writing in general be refused to the Nambikwara except
by determining writing according to a model? Later on
we[]{#calibre_link-2648} shall ask, confronting many passages in
Lévi-Strauss, up to what point it is legitimate not to call by the name
of writing those "few dots" and "zigzags" on their calabashes, so
briefly evoked in *Tristes Tropiques*. But above all, how can we deny
the practice of writing in general to a society capable of obliterating
the proper, that is to say a violent society? For writing, obliteration
of the[]{#calibre_link-2649} proper classed in the play of difference,
is the originary violence itself: pure impossibility of the "vocative
mark," impossible purity of the mark of vocation. This "equivocation,"
which Rousseau hoped would be "eliminated" by a "vocative mark," cannot
be effaced. For the existence of such a mark in any code of punctuation
would not change the problem. The death of absolutely proper naming,
recognizing[]{#calibre_link-2650} in a language the other as pure other,
invoking it as what it is, is the death of the pure idiom reserved for
the unique. Anterior to the possibility of violence in the current and
derivative sense, the sense used in "A Writing Lesson," there is, as the
space of its possibility, the violence of the arche-writing, the
violence of difference, of classification, and of the system of
appellations.[]{#calibre_link-2651} Before outlining the structure of
this implication, let us read the scene of proper names; with another
scene, that we shall shortly read, it is an indispensable preparation
for the "Writing Lesson." This scene is separated from the "Writing
Lesson" by one chapter and another scene: "Family Life." And it is
described in Chapter 26 \[23\] "On the Line."

The Nambikwara make no difficulties and are[]{#calibre_link-2652} quite
indifferent to the presence of the anthropologist with his notebooks and
camera. But certain problems of language complicated matters. They are
not allowed, for instance, to use proper names. To tell one from another
we had to do as the men of the line do and agree with the Nambikwara on
a set of nicknames which would serve for identification. Either
Portuguese names, like Julio, Jose-Maria,[]{#calibre_link-2653} Luisa;
or sobriquets such as *Lebre*, hare, or *Assucar*, sugar. I even knew
one whom Rondon or one []{#calibre_link-1000}of his companions had
nicknamed Cavaignac on account of his little pointed beard---a rarity
among Indians, most of whom have no hair on their faces. One day, when I
was playing with a group of children, a little girl was struck by one of
her comrades. She ran to me for protection and began to
whisper[]{#calibre_link-2654} something, a "great secret," in my ear. As
I did not understand I had to ask her to repeat it over and over again.
Eventually her adversary found out what was going on, came up to me in a
rage, and tried in her turn to tell me what seemed to be another secret.
After a little while I was able to get to the bottom of the incident.
The first little girl was trying to tell me her enemy's name, and
when[]{#calibre_link-2655} the enemy found out what was going on she
decided to tell me the other girl's name, by way of reprisal.
Thenceforward it was easy enough, though not very scrupulous, to egg the
children on, one against the other, till in time I knew all of their
names. When this was completed and we were all, in a sense, one
another's accomplices, I soon got them to give me the adults' names too.
When this \[cabal\][]{#calibre_link-2656} was discovered the children
were reprimanded and my sources of information dried
up.^[]{#calibre_link-666}[7](#calibre_link-300){.nounder}^

We cannot enter here into the difficulties of an empirical deduction of
this prohibition, but we know a priori that the "proper names" whose
interdiction and revelation Lévi-Strauss describes here are not proper
names. The expression "proper name" is improper, for the very reasons
that *The Savage Mind* will recall.[]{#calibre_link-2657} What the
interdict is laid upon is the uttering of what *functions* as the proper
name. And this function is *consciousness* itself. The proper name in
the colloquial sense, in the sense of consciousness, is (I should say
"in truth" were it not necessary to be wary of that
phrase)^[]{#calibre_link-667}[8](#calibre_link-301){.nounder}^ only a
designation of appurtenance and a linguistico-social classification. The
lifting of the interdict, the great game[]{#calibre_link-2658} of
denunciation and the great exhibition of the "proper" (let us note that
we speak here of an act of war and there is much to say about the fact
that it is little girls who open themselves to this game and these
hostilities) does not consist in revealing proper names, but in tearing
the veil hiding a classification and an appurtenance, the inscription
within a system of linguistico-social differences.

:::

What the Nambikwara hid and the young girls lay bare through
transgression, is no longer the absolute idioms, but already varieties
of invested common names, "abstracts" if, as we read in *The Savage
Mind* (p. 242) \[p. 182\], "systems of appellations also have their
'abstracts.' "

The concept of the proper name, unproblematized as Lévi-Strauss uses it
in *Tristes Tropiques*, is therefore far from[]{#calibre_link-2660}
being simple and manageable. Consequently, the same may be said of the
concepts of violence, ruse, perfidy, or oppression, that punctuate "A
Writing Lesson" a little further on. We have already noted that violence
here does not unexpectedly break in all at once, starting from an
original innocence whose nakedness is *surprised* at the very moment
that the secret of the *so-called* proper names
[]{#calibre_link-2661}is[]{#calibre_link-2662} violated. The structure
of violence is complex and its possibility-writing---no less so.

There was in fact a first violence to be named. To name, to give names
that it will on occasion be forbidden to pronounce, such is the
originary violence of language which consists in inscribing within a
difference, in classifying, in suspending the vocative absolute. To
think the unique *within* the system,[]{#calibre_link-2663} to inscribe
it there, such is the gesture of the arche-writing: arche-violence, loss
of the proper, of absolute proximity, of self-presence, in truth the
loss of what has never taken place, of a self-presence which has never
been given but only dreamed of and always already split, repeated,
incapable of appearing to itself except in its own disappearance. Out of
this arche-violence, forbidden and[]{#calibre_link-2664} therefore
confirmed by a second violence that is reparatory, protective,
instituting the "moral," prescribing the concealment of writing and the
effacement and obliteration of the so-called proper name which was
already dividing the proper, a third violence can *possibly* emerge or
not (an empirical possibility) within what is commonly called evil, war,
indiscretion, rape; which consists of revealing[]{#calibre_link-2665} by
effraction the so-called proper name, the originary violence which has
severed the proper from its property and its self-sameness
*\[proprété\]*. We could name a third violence of reflection, which
denudes the native nonidentity, classification as denaturation of the
proper, and identity as the abstract moment of the concept. It is on
this tertiary level, that of the empirical consciousness,
that[]{#calibre_link-2666} the common concept of violence (the system of
the moral law and of transgression) whose possibility remains yet
unthought, should no doubt be situated. The scene of proper names is
written on this level; as will be later the writing lesson.

This last violence is all the more complex in its structure because it
refers at the same time to the two inferior levels of arche-violence and
of law. In[]{#calibre_link-2667} effect, it reveals the first nomination
which was already an expropriation, but it denudes also that which since
then functioned as the proper, the so-called proper, substitute of the
deferred proper, *perceived* by the *social* and *moral consciousness*
as the proper, the reassuring seal of self-identity, the secret.

Empirical violence, war in the colloquial sense (ruse and perfidy of
little girls, *[]{#calibre_link-2668}apparent* ruse and perfidy of
little girls, for the anthropologist will prove them innocent by showing
himself as the true and only culprit; ruse and perfidy of the Indian
chief playing at the comedy of writing, *apparent* ruse and perfidy of
the Indian chief borrowing all his resources from the Occidental
intrusion), which Lévi-Strauss always thinks of as an *accident*. An
accident occurring, in his[]{#calibre_link-2669} view, upon a terrain of
innocence, in a "state of culture" whose *natural* goodness had not yet
been degraded.^[]{#calibre_link-668}[9](#calibre_link-302){.nounder}^

Two pointers, seemingly anecdotal and belonging to the decor of the
representation to come, support this hypothesis that the "Writing
Lesson" will []{#calibre_link-2670}confirm. They announce the great
staging of the "lesson" and show to advantage the art of the composition
of this travelogue. In accordance[]{#calibre_link-2671} with
eighteenth-century tradition, the anecdote, the page of confessions, the
fragment from a journal are knowledgeably put in place, calculated for
the purposes of a philosophical demonstration of the relationships
between nature and society, ideal society and real society, most often
between the *other* society and our *society*.

What is the first pointer? The battle of proper names follows
the[]{#calibre_link-2672} arrival of the foreigner and that is not
surprising. It is born in the presence and even from the presence of the
anthropologist who comes to disturb order and natural peace, the
complicity which peacefully binds the good society to itself in its
play. Not only have the people of the Line imposed ridiculous sobriquets
on the natives, obliging them to assume these intrinsically (hare,
sugar, Cavaignac),[]{#calibre_link-2673} but it is the anthropological
eruption which breaks the secret of the proper names and the innocent
complicity governing the play of young girls. It is the anthropologist
who violates a virginal space so accurately connoted by the scene of a
game and a game played by little girls. The mere presence of the
foreigner, the mere fact of his having his eyes open, cannot not provoke
a violation:[]{#calibre_link-2674} the *aside*, the secret murmured in
the ear, the successive movements of the "stratagem," the acceleration,
the precipitation, a certain increasing jubilation in the movement
before the falling back which follows the consummated fault, when the
"sources" have "dried up," makes us think of a dance and a fête as much
as of war.

The mere presence of a spectator, then, is a violation. First a
pure[]{#calibre_link-2675} violation: a silent and immobile foreigner
attends a game of young girls. That one of them should have "struck" a
"comrade" is not yet true violence. No integrity has been breached.
Violence appears only at the moment when the intimacy of proper names
can be opened to forced entry. And that is possible only at the moment
when the space is shaped and reoriented by the glance of the foreigner.
The eye[]{#calibre_link-2676} of the other calls out the proper names,
spells them out, and removes the prohibition that covered them.

At first the anthropologist is satisfied merely to see. A fixed glance
and a mute presence. Then things get complicated, become more tortuous
and labyrinthine, when he becomes a party to the play of the rupture of
play, as he lends an ear and broaches a first complicity with the victim
who[]{#calibre_link-2677} is also the trickster. Finally, for what
counts is the names of the adults (one could say the eponyms and the
secret is violated only in the place where the names are attributed),
the ultimate denunciation can no longer do without the active
intervention of the foreigner. Who, moreover, claims to have intervened
and accuses himself of it. He has seen, then heard; but, passive in the
face of what[]{#calibre_link-2678} he already knew he was provoking, he
still waited to hear the master-names. The violation was not
consummated, the naked base of the proper was still reserved. As one
cannot or rather must not incriminate []{#calibre_link-1039}the innocent
young girls, the violation will be accomplished by the thenceforward
active, perfidious, and rusing intrusion of the foreigner who, having
seen and heard, is now going to "excite"[]{#calibre_link-2679} the young
girls, loosen their tongues, and get them to divulge the precious names:
those of the adults (the dissertation tells us that only "the adults
possessed names that were proper to them," p. 39). With a bad
conscience, to be sure, and with that pity which Rousseau said unites us
with the most foreign of foreigners. Let us now reread the *mea culpa*,
the confession of the anthropologist who[]{#calibre_link-2680} assumes
entire responsibility for a violation that has satisfied him. After
*giving* one another *away*, the young girls *gave away* the adults.

The first little girl was trying to tell me her enemy's name, and when
the enemy found out what was going on she decided to tell me the other
girl's name, by way of reprisal. Thenceforward it was easy enough,
though not very scrupulous, to egg the children[]{#calibre_link-2681}
on, one against the other, till in time I knew all their names. When
this was completed and we were all, in a sense, one another's
accomplices, I soon got them to give me the adults' names too \[p.
270\].

The true culprit will not be punished, and this gives to his fault the
stamp of the irremediable: "When this \[cabal\] was discovered the
children were reprimanded and my sources of
information[]{#calibre_link-2682} dried up."

One already suspects---and all Lévi-Strauss's writings would confirm
it---that the critique of ethnocentrism, a theme so dear to the author
of *Tristes Tropiques*, has most often the sole function of constituting
the other as a model of original and natural goodness, of accusing and
humiliating oneself, of exhibiting its being-unacceptable in an
anti-ethnocentric mirror. Rousseau would have[]{#calibre_link-2683}
taught the modern anthropologist this humility of one who knows he is
"unacceptable," this remorse that produces
anthropology.^[]{#calibre_link-669}[10](#calibre_link-303){.nounder}^
That is at least what we are told in the Geneva lecture:

In truth, I am not "I," but the feeblest and humblest of "others." Such
is the discovery of the *Confessions*. Does the anthropologist write
anything other than confessions? First in his own name, as I have
shown,[]{#calibre_link-2684} since it is the moving force of his
vocation and his work; and in that very work, in the name of the
society, which, through the activities of its emissary, the
anthropologist, chooses for itself other societies, other civilizations,
and precisely the weakest and most humble; but only to verify to what
extent that first society is itself "unacceptable" (p. 245).

Without speaking of the point[]{#calibre_link-2685} of mastery thus
gained by the person who conducts this operation at home, one
rediscovers here a gesture inherited from the eighteenth century, from a
certain eighteenth century at any rate, for even in that century a
certain sporadic suspicion of such an exercise had already commenced.
Non-European peoples were not only studied as the
[]{#calibre_link-884}index to a hidden good Nature, as a native soil
recovered,[]{#calibre_link-2686} of a "zero degree" with reference to
which one could outline the structure, the growth, and above all the
degradation of our society and our culture. As always, this archeology
is also a teleology and an eschatology; the dream of a full and
immediate presence closing history, the transparence and indivision of a
parousia, the suppression of contradiction and difference. The
anthropologist's mission,[]{#calibre_link-2687} as Rousseau would have
assigned it, is to work toward such an end. Possibly against the
philosophy which "alone" would have sought to "excite" "antagonisms"
between the "self and the
other."^[]{#calibre_link-670}[11](#calibre_link-304){.nounder}^ Let us
not be accused here of forcing words and things. Let us rather read. It
is again the Geneva lecture, but a hundred similar passages may be
found:

The Rousseauist revolution, pre-forming and
initiating[]{#calibre_link-2688} the anthropological revolution,
consists in refusing the expected identifications, whether that of a
culture with that culture, or that of an individual, member of one
culture, with a personage or a social function that the same culture
wishes to impose upon him. In both cases the culture or the individual
insists on the right to a free identification which can only be realized
*beyond* man: an[]{#calibre_link-2689} identification with all that
lives and therefore suffers; and an identification which can also be
realized *short of* the function or the person; with a yet unfashioned,
but given, being. Then the self and the other, freed of an antagonism
that only philosophy seeks to excite, recover their unity. An original
alliance, at last renewed, permits them to found together the *we*
against the *him*, against[]{#calibre_link-2690} a society inimical to
man, and which man finds himself all the more ready to challenge because
Rousseau, by his example, teaches him how to elude the intolerable
contradictions of civilized life. For if it is true that Nature has
expelled man, and that society persists in oppressing him, man can at
least reverse the horns of the dilemma to his own advantage, *and seek
out the society of nature[]{#calibre_link-2691} in order to meditate
there upon the nature of society*. This, it seems to me, is the
indissoluble message of *The Social Contract*, the *Lettres sur la
botanique*, and the
*Reveries.^[]{#calibre_link-671}[12](#calibre_link-305){.nounder}^*

"A Little Glass of Rum," which is a severe criticism of Diderot and a
glorification of Rousseau ("\[who\] of all the *philosophes*, came
nearest to being an anthropologist ... our master ... our brother, great
as has been our[]{#calibre_link-2692} ingratitude toward him; and every
page of this book could have been dedicated to him, had the object thus
proffered not been unworthy of his great memory") concludes thus: "...
the question to be solved is whether or not these evils are themselves
inherent in that state \[of society\]. We must go beyond the evidence of
the injustices or abuses to which the social order gives rise and
discover the unshakeable[]{#calibre_link-2693} basis of human
society."^[]{#calibre_link-672}[13](#calibre_link-306){.nounder}^

The diversified thinking of Lévi-Strauss would be impoverished if it
were not emphatically recalled here that this goal and this motivation
do not exhaust, though they do more than connote, the task of science.
They []{#calibre_link-1029}mark it profoundly in its very content. I had
promised a second pointer. The Nambikwara, around whom the "Writing
Lesson" will unfold its scene, among whom[]{#calibre_link-2694} evil
will insinuate itself with the intrusion of writing come from *without
(exothen*, as the *Phaedrus* says)---the Nambikwara, who do not know how
to write, are *good*, we are told. The Jesuits, the Protestant
missionaries, the American anthropologists, the technicians on the Line,
who believed they perceived violence or hatred among the Nambikwara are
not only mistaken, they have probably projected[]{#calibre_link-2695}
their own wickedness upon them. And even provoked the evil that they
then believed they saw or wished to perceive. Let us reread the end of
Chapter 17 \[24\], entitled, always with the same skill, "Family Life."
This passage immediately precedes "A Writing Lesson" and is, in a
certain way, indespensable to it. Let us first confirm what goes without
saying: if we subscribe to Lévi-Strauss's
declarations[]{#calibre_link-2696} about their innocence and goodness,
their "great sweetness of nature," "the most... authentic manifestations
of human tenderness," etc. only by assigning them a totally derived,
relative, and empirical place of legitimacy, regarding them as
descriptions of the empirical affections of the *subject* of this
chapter---the Nambikwara as well as the author---if then we subscribe to
these descriptions only[]{#calibre_link-2697} as *empirical relation*,
it does not follow that we give credence to the moralizing descriptions
of the American anthropologist's converse deploring of the hatred,
surliness, and lack of civility of the natives. In fact these two
accounts are symmetrically opposed, they have the same dimensions, and
arrange themselves around one and the same axis. After having cited a
foreign colleague's publication,[]{#calibre_link-2698} which is very
severe toward the Nambikwara for their complacency in the face of
disease, their filthiness, wretchedness, and rudeness, their rancorous
and distrustful character, Lévi-Strauss argues:

When I myself had known them, the diseases introduced by white men had
already decimated them; but there had not been, since Rondon's always
humane endeavors, any attempt to enforce their
submission.[]{#calibre_link-2699} I should prefer to forget Mr. Oberg's
harrowing description and remember the Nambikwara as they appear in a
page from my notebooks. I wrote it one night by the light of my
pocket-lamp: "The camp-fires shine out in the darkened savannah. Around
the hearth which is their only protection from the cold, behind the
flimsy screen of foliage and palm-leaves which had been stuck into the
ground where[]{#calibre_link-2700} it will best break the force of wind
and rain, beside the baskets filled with the pitiable objects which
comprise all their earthly belongings, the Nambikwara lie on the bare
earth. Always they are haunted by the thought of other groups, as
fearful and hostile as they are themselves, and when they lie entwined
together, couple by couple, each looks to his mate for support and
comfort and finds in[]{#calibre_link-2701} the other a bulwark, the only
one he knows, against the difficulties of every day and the meditative
melancholia which from time to time overwhelms the Nambikwara. The
visitor who camps among the Indians for the first time cannot but feel
anguish and pity at the sight of a people so totally dis-provided
[]{#calibre_link-847}for; beaten down into the hostile earth, it would
seem, by an implacable cataclysm; naked and[]{#calibre_link-2702}
shivering beside their guttering fires. He gropes his way among the
bushes, avoiding where he can the hand, or the arm, or the torso that
lies gleaming in the firelight. But this misery is enlivened by laughing
whispers. Their embraces are those of couples possessed by a longing for
a lost oneness; their caresses are in no wise disturbed by the footfall
of a stranger. In one and all there may be[]{#calibre_link-2703}
glimpsed a great sweetness of nature, a profound nonchalance, an animal
satisfaction as ingenuous as it is charming, and, beneath all this,
something that can be recognized as one of the most moving and authentic
manifestations of human tenderness" \[p. 285\].

The "Writing Lesson" follows this description, which one may indeed read
for what it claims, at the outset, to be: a page "from my
notebooks"[]{#calibre_link-2704} scribbled one night in the light of a
pocket lamp. It would be different if this moving painting were to
belong to an anthropological discourse. However, it certainly sets up a
premise---the goodness or innocence of the Nambikwara---indispensable to
the subsequent demonstration of the conjoint intrusion of violence and
writing. Here a strict separation of the anthropological confession and
the theoretical[]{#calibre_link-2705} discussion of the anthropologist
must be observed. The difference between empirical and essential must
continue to assert its rights.

We know that Lévi-Strauss has very harsh words for the philosophies that
have made the mind aware of this distinction, and which are, for the
most part, philosophies of consciousness, of the cogito in the Cartesian
or Husserlian sense. Very harsh words also for
*[]{#calibre_link-2706}L'Essai sur les données immédiates de la
conscience,[]{#calibre_link-1161}[\*](#calibre_link-307){.nounder}*
which Lévi-Strauss reproaches his old teachers for having pondered too
much instead of studying Saussure's *Course in General
Linguistics*.^[]{#calibre_link-673}[14](#calibre_link-308){.nounder}^
Now whatever one may finally think of philosophies thus incriminated or
ridiculed (and of which I shall say nothing here except to note that
only their ghosts, which sometimes haunt school manuals,
selected[]{#calibre_link-2707} extracts, or popular opinion, are evoked
here), it should be recognized that the difference between empirical
affect and the structure of essence was for them a major rule. Neither
Descartes nor Husserl would ever have suggested that they considered an
empirical modification of their relationship with the world or with
others as scientific truth, nor the quality of an emotion as the premise
of[]{#calibre_link-2708} a syllogism. Never in the *Regulae* does one
pass from the phenomenologically irrefutable truth of "I see yellow" to
the judgment "the world is yellow." Let us not pursue this direction.
Never, at any rate, would a rigorous philosopher of consciousness have
been so quickly persuaded of the fundamental goodness and virginal
innocence of the Nambikwara merely on the strength of an empirical
account.[]{#calibre_link-2709} From the point of view of anthropological
science, this conclusion is []{#calibre_link-908}as surprising as the
wicked American anthropologist's might be "distressing" (Lévi-Strauss's
word). Surprising, indeed, that this unconditional affirmation of the
radical goodness of the Nambikwara comes from the pen of an
anthropologist who sets against the bloodless phantoms of the
philosophers of consciousness and intuition,[]{#calibre_link-2710} those
who have been, if the beginning of *Tristes Tropiques* is to be
believed, his only true masters: Marx and Freud.

The thinkers assembled hastily at the beginning of that book under the
banner of metaphysics, phenomenology, and existentialism, would not be
recognized in the lineaments ascribed to them. But it would be wrong to
conclude that, conversely, Marx and Freud would have been
satisfied[]{#calibre_link-2711} by the theses written in their
name---and notably the chapters that interest us. They generally
demanded to see proof when one spoke of "great sweetness of nature,"
"profound nonchalance," "animal satisfaction as ingenuous as it is
charming," and "something that can be recognized as one of the most
moving and authentic manifestations of human tenderness." They wanted to
see proof and would undoubtedly[]{#calibre_link-2712} not have
understood what could possibly be referred to as "the original alliance,
later renewed," permitting "the found\[ing\] together of the *we*
against the *him"* (already quoted), or as "that regular and, as it were
crystalline structure which the best-preserved of primitive societies
teach us is not antagonistic to the human condition" (*Leçon inaugurale
au Collège de France*,
p.49).[]{#calibre_link-1163}[\*](#calibre_link-309){.nounder}

Within this[]{#calibre_link-2713} entire system of philosophical kinship
and claims of genealogical filiations, not the least surprised might
well be Rousseau. Had he not asked that he be allowed to live in peace
with the philosophers of consciousness and of interior sentiment, in
peace with that sensible
cogito,^[]{#calibre_link-674}[15](#calibre_link-310){.nounder}^ with
that interior voice which, he believed, never lied? To reconcile
Rousseau, Marx, and Freud is a difficult task.[]{#calibre_link-2714} Is
it possible to make them agree among themselves in the systematic rigor
of conceptuality?

#### ***Writing and Man's Exploitation by Man*** {#calibre_link-26 .h3}

*The "bricoleur" may not ever complete his purpose but he always puts
something of himself into it.---The Savage Mind*

*Perhaps his system is false; but developing it, he has painted himself
truly.---J.-J. Rousseau, Dialogues*

Let us finally open "A Writing Lesson." If[]{#calibre_link-2715} I give
so much attention to the chapter, it is not in order to take unfair
advantage of a travel journal, []{#calibre_link-1033}something that
could be considered the least scientific expression of a thought. On the
one hand, all the themes of the systematic theory of writing presented
for the first time in *Tristes Tropiques* may be found in other
writings,^[]{#calibre_link-675}[16](#calibre_link-311){.nounder}^ in
another form and more or less dispersed. On the
other[]{#calibre_link-2716} hand, the theoretical content is itself
expounded at length in this work, at greater length than anywhere else,
by way of comment on an "extraordinary incident." This incident is also
reported in the same terms at the beginning of the dissertation on the
Nambikwara, seven years earlier than *Tristes Tropiques*. Finally, it is
only in *Tristes Tropiques* that the system is articulated in the most
rigorous[]{#calibre_link-2717} and complete way. The indispensable
premises, namely the nature of the organism submitted to the aggression
of writing, are nowhere more explicit. That is why I have followed the
description of the innocence of the Nambikwara at length. Only an
innocent community, and a community of reduced dimensions (a Rousseauist
theme that will soon become clearer), only a micro-society of
non-violence[]{#calibre_link-2718} and freedom, all the members of which
can by rights remain within range of an immediate and transparent, a
"crystalline" address, fully self-present in its living speech, only
such a community can suffer, as the surprise of an aggression coming
*from without*, the insinuation of writing, the infiltration of its
"ruse" and of its "perfidy." Only such a community can import *from
abroad* "the exploitation[]{#calibre_link-2719} of man by man." "The
Lesson" is therefore complete; in subsequent texts, the theoretical
conclusions of the incident will be presented without the concrete
premises, original innocence will be *implied but not expounded*. In the
previous text, the dissertation on the Nambikwara, the incident is
reported but it does not lead, as in *Tristes Tropiques*, to a long
meditation on the historical meaning,[]{#calibre_link-2720} origin, and
function of the written. On the other hand, I shall draw from the
dissertation information that will be valuable as annotations to
*Tristes Tropiques*.

Writing, the exploitation of man by man: I do not impose these words
upon Lévi-Strauss. Let us recall the *Conversations* by way of
precaution: "... writing itself, in that first instance, seemed to be
associated in any permanent way only[]{#calibre_link-2721} with
societies which were based on the exploitation of man by man" (p. 36)
\[p. 30\]. In *Tristes Tropiques*, Lévi-Strauss is aware of proposing a
Marxist theory of writing. He says it in a letter of 1955 (the year the
book appeared) to the *Nouvelle critique*. Criticized by M. Rodinson in
the name of Marxism, he complains:

If he \[M. Rodinson\] had read my book, instead of confining himself to
the extracts[]{#calibre_link-2722} published a few months ago, he would
have discovered---in addition to a Marxist hypothesis on the origins of
writing---two studies dedicated to Brazilian tribes (the Caduveo and the
Bororo), which are efforts to interpret native superstructures based
upon dialectical materialism. The novelty of this approach in the
Western anthropological literature perhaps deserves more attention and
sympathy.^[]{#calibre_link-676}[17](#calibre_link-312){.nounder}^

[]{#calibre_link-997}[]{#calibre_link-2723}Our question is therefore no
longer only "how to reconcile Rousseau and Marx" but also: "Is it
sufficient to speak of superstructure and to denounce in an hypothesis
an exploitation of man by man in order to confer a Marxian pertinence
upon this hypothesis?" A question that has meaning only through implying
an original rigor in Marxist criticism and distinguish it from all other
criticism of suffering,[]{#calibre_link-2724} of violence, of
exploitation, etc.; for example, from Buddhist criticism. Our question
has clearly no meaning at the point where one can say "between Marxist
criticism ... and Buddhist criticism ... there is neither opposition nor
contradiction."^[]{#calibre_link-677}[18](#calibre_link-313){.nounder}^

Another precaution is necessary before the "Lesson." I have earlier
emphasized the ambiguity of the ideology which governs the Saussurian
exclusion of[]{#calibre_link-2725} writing: a profound ethnocentrism
privileging the model of phonetic writing, a model that makes the
exclusion of the *graphie* easier and more legitimate. It is, however,
an ethnocentrism *thinking itself* as anti-ethnocentrism, an
ethnocentrism in the consciousness of a liberating progressivism. By
radically separating language from writing, by placing the latter below
and outside, believing at least[]{#calibre_link-2726} that it is
possible to do so, by giving oneself the illusion of liberating
linguistics from all involvement with written evidence, one thinks in
fact to restore the status of authentic language, human and fully
signifying language, to all languages practiced by *peoples whom one
nevertheless continues to describe as "without writing."* It is not
fortuitous that the same ambiguity affects
Lévi-Strauss's[]{#calibre_link-2727} intentions.

*On the one hand*, the colloquial difference between language and
writing, the rigorous exteriority of one with respect to the other, is
admitted. This permits the distinction between peoples using writing and
peoples without writing. Lévi-Strauss is never suspicious of the value
of such a distinction. This above all allows him to consider the passage
from speech to writing as a *leap*[]{#calibre_link-2728}, as the
instantaneous crossing of a line of discontinuity: passage from a fully
oral language, pure of all writing---*pure*, innocent---to a language
appending to itself its graphic "representation" as an accessory
signifier of a new type, opening a technique of oppression. Lévi-Strauss
needed this "epigenetist" concept of writing in order that the theme of
evil and of exploitation suddenly coming about[]{#calibre_link-2729}
with the *graphie* could indeed be the theme of a surprise and an
accident affecting the purity of an innocent language from without.
Affecting it *as if by
chance.^[]{#calibre_link-678}[19](#calibre_link-314){.nounder}^* At any
rate the epigenetist thesis repeats, in connection with writing this
time, an affirmation that we could have encountered five years
previously in the *Introduction à l'oeuvre de Marcel Mauss* (p. 47):
"Language could only have[]{#calibre_link-2730} been born suddenly." We
might well find numerous questions to raise about this paragraph, which
ties sense to signification and more narrowly to linguistic
signification in the *spoken* language. Let us simply read these few
lines:

[]{#calibre_link-971}Whatever might have been the moment and the
circumstances of its appearance on the scale of animal life, language
could only have been born suddenly. Things could
not[]{#calibre_link-2731} have begun to signify progressively. Following
a transformation whose study does not belong to the social sciences, but
to biology and psychology, a passage was effected from a stage where
nothing had sense to another where everything did.

(That biology and psychology could account for this rupture would seem
to us more than problematic. There follows a fertile distinction between
*signifying*[]{#calibre_link-2732} discourse and *knowing* discourse,
which, some fifty years previously, a philosopher of consciousness, more
neglected than others, had articulated rigorously in logical
investigations.) []{#calibre_link-1165}[\*](#calibre_link-315){.nounder}

This epigenetism is, nevertheless, not the most Rousseauist aspect of a
thought which so often gives as its authority the *Essay on the Origin
of Languages* and the second *Discourse*---where however it is also a
question[]{#calibre_link-2733} of "the infinite space of time that the
first invention of languages must have cost" \[p. 189\].

The traditional and fundamental ethnocentrism which, inspired by the
model of phonetic writing, separates writing from speech with an ax, is
thus handled and thought of as anti-ethnocentrism. It supports an
ethico-political accusation: man's exploitation by man is the fact of
writing cultures of the[]{#calibre_link-2734} Western type. Communities
of innocent and unoppressive speech are free from this accusation.

*On the other hand*---it is the other side of the same gesture---if
Lévi-Strauss constantly recognizes the pertinence of the division
between peoples with and peoples without writing, this division is
effaced by him from the moment that one might ethnocentrically wish to
make it play a role in the reflection[]{#calibre_link-2735} on history
and on the respective value of cultures. The difference between peoples
with and peoples without writing is accepted, but writing as the
criterion of historicity or cultural value is not taken into account;
ethnocentrism will apparently be avoided at the very moment when it will
have already profoundly operated, silently imposing its standard
concepts of speech and writing. This was exactly[]{#calibre_link-2736}
the pattern of the Saussurian gesture. In other words, all the
liberating criticisms and legitimate denunciations with which
Lévi-Strauss has harried the presupposed distinctions between historical
societies and societies without history, remain dependent on the concept
of writing I problematize here.

What is the "Writing Lesson?"

Lesson in a double sense. The title effectively preserves
both[]{#calibre_link-2737} senses. Writing lesson since it is a question
of the learning of writing. The Nambikwara chief learns writing from the
anthropologist, at first without []{#calibre_link-2738}comprehension, he
mimics writing before he understands its function as language; or rather
he understands its profoundly enslaving function before understanding
its function, here accessory, of communication, signification, of the
tradition of[]{#calibre_link-2739} a signified. But the writing lesson
is also a lesson learned from writing; instruction that the
anthropologist believes he can induce from the incident in the course of
a long meditation, when, fighting against insomnia, he reflects on the
origin, function, and meaning of writing. Having taught the gesture of
writing to a Nambikwara chief who learned without comprehension, the
anthropologist understands[]{#calibre_link-2740} what he has taught and
induces the lesson of writing.

Thus, two moments:

A. The empirical relation of a perception: the scene of the
"extraordinary incident."

B. After the vicissitudes of the day, sleepless in the watches of the
night, a historico-philosophical reflection on the scene of writing and
the profound meaning of the incident, of the closed history of writing.

A. *The extraordinary[]{#calibre_link-2741} incident*. From the very
first lines, the decor reminds us of that anthropological violence of
which I spoke above. The two parts are well engaged here, and that
restores the true meaning of the remarks on "a great sweetness of
nature," "an animal satisfaction as ingenuous as it is charming," the
"profound nonchalance," "the most moving and authentic manifestations of
human tenderness." For example:

... their more than dubious welcome combined with their leader's extreme
nervousness seemed to suggest that he had forced their hand, somewhat,
in the whole matter. Neither we nor the Indians felt at all at our ease,
the night promised to be cold, and, as there were no trees, we had to
lie, like the Nambikwara, on the bare ground. No one slept: we kept, all
night long, a polite watch upon one another.[]{#calibre_link-2743} It
would have been rash to prolong the adventure, and I suggested to the
leader that we should get down to our exchanges without further delay.
It was then that there occurred an extraordinary incident which forces
me to go back a little in time. That the Nambikwara could not write goes
without saying. But they were also unable to draw, except for a few dots
and zigzags on their calabashes.[]{#calibre_link-2744} I distributed
pencils and paper among them, none the less, as I had done with the
Caduveo. At first they made no use of them. Then, one day, I saw that
they were all busy drawing wavy horizontal lines on the paper. What were
they trying to do? I could only conclude that they were writing---or,
more exactly, they were trying to do as I did with my pencils. As I had
never tried to amuse them with drawings,[]{#calibre_link-2745} they
could not conceive of any other use for this implement. With most of
them, that was as far as they got: but their leader saw further into the
problem. Doubtless he was the only one among them to have understood
what writing was for \[p. 288\].

Let us mark a first pause here. Among many others, this fragment comes
superimposed upon a passage from the thesis on the Nambikwara. The
[]{#calibre_link-917}incident was[]{#calibre_link-2746} already related
there and it may be useful to refer to it. Three specific points omitted
from *Tristes Tropiques* can be found in the thesis. They are not
without interest.

1\. This small group of
Nambikwara^[]{#calibre_link-679}[20](#calibre_link-316){.nounder}^
nevertheless uses a word to designate the act of writing, at least a
word that may serve that end. There is no linguistic surprise in the
face of the supposed irruption of a new power.
This[]{#calibre_link-2747} detail, omitted from *Tristes Tropiques*, was
indicated in the thesis:

The Nambikwara of group (a) do not know anything about design, if one
excepts some geometric sketches on their calabashes. For many days, they
did not know what to do with the paper and the pencils that we
distributed to them. Some time later, we saw them very busily drawing
wavy lines. In that they imitated the only use
that[]{#calibre_link-2748} they had seen us make of our notebooks,
namely writing, but without understanding its meaning or its end. They
called the act of writing iekariukedjutu, namely: "drawing lines."

It is quite evident that a literal translation of the words that mean
"to write" in the languages of peoples with writing would also reduce
that word to a rather poor gestural signification. It is as if one said
that[]{#calibre_link-2749} such a language has no word designating
writing---and that therefore those who practice it do not know how to
write---just because they use a word meaning "to scratch," "to engrave,"
"to scribble," "to scrape," "to incise," "to trace," "to imprint," etc.
As if "to write" in its metaphoric kernel, meant something else. Is not
ethnocentrism always betrayed by the haste with which it is satisfied by
certain[]{#calibre_link-2750} translations or certain domestic
equivalents? To say that a people do not know how to write because one
can translate the word which they use to designate the act of inscribing
as "drawing lines," is that not as if one should refuse them "speech" by
translating the equivalent word by "to cry," "to sing," "to sigh?"
Indeed "to stammer." By way of simple analogy with respect to the
mechanisms of[]{#calibre_link-2751} ethnocentric assimilation/exclusion,
let us recall with Renan that, "in the most ancient languages, the words
used to designate foreign peoples are drawn from two sources: either
words that signify 'to stammer,' 'to mumble,' or words that signify
'mute.' "^[]{#calibre_link-680}[21](#calibre_link-317){.nounder}^ And
ought one to conclude that the Chinese are a people without writing
because the word *wen* designates many things besides writing in
the[]{#calibre_link-2752} narrow sense? As in fact J. Gernet notes:

The word *wen* signifies a conglomeration of marks, the simple symbol in
writing. It applies to the veins in stones and wood, to constellations,
represented by the strokes connecting the stars, to the tracks of birds
and quadrupeds on the ground (Chinese tradition would have it that the
observation of these tracks suggested the invention of writing),
to[]{#calibre_link-2753} tattoo and even, for example, to the designs
that decorate the turtle's shell ("The turtle is wise," an ancient text
says---gifted with magico-religious powers---"for it carries designs on
its back"). The term *wen* has designated, by extension, literature and
social courtesy. Its []{#calibre_link-2754}antonyms are the words *wu*
(warrior, military) and *zhi* (brute matter not yet polished or
ornamented).^[]{#calibre_link-681}[22](#calibre_link-318){.nounder}^

2\. In this operation,[]{#calibre_link-2755} which consists of "drawing
lines" and which is thus incorporated into the dialect of this subgroup,
Lévi-Strauss finds an exclusively "aesthetic" signification: "They
called the act of writing iekariukedjutu, namely 'drawing lines,' which
had an aesthetic interest for them." One wonders what the import of such
a conclusion could be and what the specificity of the aesthetic category
could signify[]{#calibre_link-2756} here. Lévi-Strauss seems not only to
presume that one can isolate aesthetic value (which is clearly most
problematic, and in fact it is the anthropologists more than anyone else
who have put us on guard against this abstraction), but also to suppose
that in writing "properly speaking," to which the Nambikwara would not
have access, the aesthetic quality is extrinsic. Let us merely mention
this[]{#calibre_link-2757} problem. Moreover, even if one did not wish
to treat the meaning of such a conclusion with suspicion, one could
still be troubled by the paths that lead to it. The anthropologist has
arrived at this conclusion through a sentence noted in *another*
subgroup: "Kihikagnere mũ![image](images/000007.jpg){.calibre7}iene"
translated by "drawing lines, that's pretty." To conclude
from[]{#calibre_link-2758} this proposition thus translated and recorded
within another group (bl), that drawing lines held for group (al) an
"aesthetic interest," which implies *only* an aesthetic interest, is
what poses problems of logic that once again we are content simply to
mention.

3\. When, in *Tristes Tropiques*, Lévi-Strauss remarks that "the
Nambikwara could not write ... they were also unable to draw, except for
a[]{#calibre_link-2759} few dots and zigzags on their calabashes,"
because, helped by instruments furnished by them, they trace only "wavy
horizontal lines" and that "with most of them, that was as far as they
got," these notations are brief. Not only are they not to be found in
the thesis, but, in fact, eighty pages further on (p. 123), the thesis
presents the results at which certain Nambikwara very quickly arrived
and[]{#calibre_link-2760} which Lévi-Strauss treats as "a cultural
innovation inspired by our own designs." It is not merely a question of
representational designs (cf. Figure 19, p. 123) showing a man or a
monkey, but of diagrams describing, explaining, writing, a genealogy and
a social structure. And that is a decisive phenomenon. It is now known,
thanks to unquestionable and abundant information, that the birth of
writing[]{#calibre_link-2761} (in the colloquial sense) was nearly
everywhere and most often linked to genealogical anxiety. The memory and
oral tradition of generations, which sometimes goes back very far with
peoples supposedly "without writing," are often cited in this
connection. Lévi-Strauss himself does it in the *Conversations* (p. 29)
\[p. 26\]:

I know, of course, that the societies we call primitive often have a
quite[]{#calibre_link-2762} staggering capacity for remembering, and we
have been told about Polynesian []{#calibre_link-143}communities who can
recite straight off family trees involving dozens of generations; but
that kind of feat obviously has its limits.

Now it is this limit which is crossed more or less everywhere when
writing---in the colloquial sense---appears. Here its function is to
conserve and give to a genealogical classification,
with[]{#calibre_link-2763} all that that might imply, a supplementary
objectification of another order. So that a people who accede to the
genealogical pattern accede also to writing in the colloquial sense,
understand its function and go much farther than *Tristes Tropiques*
gives it to be understood ("that was as far as they got"). Here one
passes from arche-writing to writing in the colloquial sense. This
passage, whose[]{#calibre_link-2764} difficulty I do not wish to
underestimate, is not a passage from speech to writing, it operates
within writing in general. The genealogical relation and social
classification are the stitched seam of arche-writing, condition of the
(so-called oral) language, and of writing in the colloquial sense.

"But their leader saw further into the problem." The dissertation tells
us that this leader is "remarkably[]{#calibre_link-2765} intelligent,
aware of his responsibilities, active, enterprising, and ingenious." "He
was a man of about thirty-five, married to three women." "His attitude
to writing is most revealing. He immediately understood its role as
sign, and the social superiority that it confers." Lévi-Strauss follows
up with an account which is reproduced in nearly the same terms in
*Tristes Tropiques:*

Doubtless he[]{#calibre_link-2766} was the only one among them who
understood what writing was for. So he asked me for one of my note pads
and thus we were similarly equipped when we were working together; he
did not give me his answers in words, but traced a wavy line or two on
the paper and gave it to me, as if I could read what he had to say. He
himself was all but deceived by his own play-acting. Each time he drew a
line he examined[]{#calibre_link-2767} it with great care, as if its
meaning must suddenly leap to the eye; and every time a look of
disappointment came over his face. But he would never give up trying,
and there was an unspoken agreement between us that his scribblings had
a meaning that I pretended to decipher; his own verbal commentary was so
prompt in coming that I had no need to ask him to explain what he had
written \[pp. 288--89\].

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2768}
:::

What immediately follows this passage corresponds to a passage in the
thesis which comes more than forty pages (p. 89) after the above and
concerns the function of the commandment, a significant fact to which I
shall return.

And now, no sooner was everyone assembled than he drew forth from a
basket a piece of paper covered with scribbled lines and pretended to
read from it. With a show of hesitation[]{#calibre_link-2769} he looked
up and down his "list" for the objects to be given in exchange for his
people's presents. To so and so a bow and arrows, a machete! and another
a string of beads! for his necklaces---and so on for
[]{#calibre_link-2770}two solid hours. What was he hoping for? To
deceive himself, perhaps: but, even more, to amaze his companions and
persuade them that *his* intermediacy was responsible for the exchanges,
that he[]{#calibre_link-2771} had allied himself with the white man, and
that he could now share in his secrets. We were in a hurry to get away,
since there would obviously be a moment of real danger at which all the
marvels I had brought would have been handed over. ... So I did not go
further into the matter and we set off on the return journey, still
guided by the Indians \[p. 289\].

The story is very beautiful. It is in fact[]{#calibre_link-2772}
tempting to read it as a parable in which each element, each semanteme,
refers to a recognized function of writing: hierarchization, the
economic function of mediation and of capitalization, participation in a
quasi-religious secret; all this, verified in any phenomenon of writing,
is here assembled, concentrated, organized in the structure of an
exemplary event or a very brief sequence of fact[]{#calibre_link-2773}
and gestures. All the organic complexity of writing is here collected
within the simple focus of a parable.

B. *The rememoration of the scene*. Let us now pass on to the lesson of
the lesson. It is longer than the relation of the incident, covers three
very dense pages, and the text of the *Conversations*, which reproduces
the essential parts of it, is considerably briefer. It is therefore in
the[]{#calibre_link-2774} thesis that the incident is reported without
theoretical commentary and in the anthropologist's confession that the
theory is most abundantly developed.

Let us follow the thread of the demonstration through the evocation of
apparently unquestionable historical facts. It is the split between the
factual certainty and its interpretative reconsideration that will be of
special interest to us. The[]{#calibre_link-2775} most serious split
appears first, but not only, between the meager fact of the
"extraordinary incident" and the general philosophy of writing. The
point of the incident in effect supports an enormous theoretical
edifice.

After the "extraordinary incident," the anthropologist's situation
remains precarious. Certain words dominate the description: "abortive
meeting," "mystifications," "something[]{#calibre_link-2776}
irritating," the anthropologist "suddenly ... found ... \[himself\]
alone, and lost, in the middle of the bush," "in despair,"
"demoralized," he "was no longer armed" in a "hostile zone" and he is
agitated by "dark thoughts." Then the threat subsides, the hostility
disappears. It is night, the incident is closed, the exchanges have
taken place; it is time to reflect upon the story, it is the moment
of[]{#calibre_link-2777} wakefulness and rememoration. "Still tormented
by this absurd incident, I slept badly. To while away the hours I went
back, in my mind, to the scene of the previous morning."

Two significances are quickly drawn from the incident itself.

1\. The appearance of writing is *instantaneous*. It is not prepared
for. Such a leap would prove that the possibility of writing does not
inhabit []{#calibre_link-2778}speech, but the[]{#calibre_link-2779}
outside of speech. "So writing had made its appearance among the
Nambikwara! But not at all, as one might have supposed, as the result of
a laborious apprenticeship." From what does Lévi-Strauss arrive at this
epigenetism that is indispensable if one wishes to safeguard the
exteriority of writing to speech? From the incident? But the scene was
not the scene of the *origin*, but only that of the
*[]{#calibre_link-2780}imitation* of writing. Even if it were a question
of writing, what has the character of suddenness here is not the passage
to writing, the invention of writing, but the importation of an already
constituted writing. It is a borrowing and an artificial borrowing. As
Lévi-Strauss himself says: "The symbol had been borrowed, but the
reality remained quite foreign to them" \[p. 290\]. Besides, this
character[]{#calibre_link-2781} of suddenness obviously belongs to all
the phenomena of the diffusion or transmission of writing. It could
never describe the appearance of writing, which has, on the contrary,
been laborious, progressive, and differentiated in its stages. And the
rapidity of the borrowing, when it happens, presupposes the previous
presence of the structures that make it possible.

2\. The second significance that[]{#calibre_link-2782} Lévi-Strauss
believes he can read in the very text of the scene is connected to the
first. Since they learned without understanding, since the Chief used
writing effectively without knowing either the way it functioned or the
content signified by it, the end of writing is political and not
theoretical, []{#calibre_link-2783}[]{#calibre_link-2784}*"sociological,
rather than ... intellectual"* \[p. 290\]. This opens and covers the
entire space within which Lévi-Strauss is now going to think writing.

The symbol had been borrowed, but the reality remained quite foreign to
them. Even the borrowing had had a sociological, rather than an
intellectual object: for it was not a question of knowing specific
things, or understanding them, or keeping them[]{#calibre_link-2785} in
mind, but merely of enhancing the prestige and authority of one
individual---or one function---at the expense of the rest of the party.
A native, still in the period of the stone age, had realized that even
if he could not himself understand the great instrument of understanding
he could at least make it serve other ends \[p. 290\].

Distinguishing thus "the sociological" from the "intellectual
end,"[]{#calibre_link-2786} attributing the former and not the latter to
writing, one credits a very problematic difference between
intersubjective relationship and knowledge. If it is true, as I in fact
believe, that writing cannot be thought outside of the horizon of
intersubjective violence, is there anything, even science, that
radically escapes it? Is there a knowledge, and, above all, a language,
scientific or not,[]{#calibre_link-2787} that one can call alien at once
to writing and to violence? If one answers in the negative, as I do, the
use of these concepts to discern the specific character of writing is
not pertinent. So much so that all the
examples^[]{#calibre_link-682}[23](#calibre_link-319){.nounder}^ by
which Lévi-Strauss next illustrates this proposition are of course true
and probing, but too much so. The conclusion that they sustain goes far
beyond the field of what[]{#calibre_link-2788} is here called "writing"
("writing" in the []{#calibre_link-969}usual sense). It also covers the
field of unwritten speech. In other words, if writing is to be related
to violence, writing appears well before writing in the narrow sense;
already in the differance or the arche-writing that opens speech itself.

Thus suggesting what he will later confirm, that the essential function
of writing is to favor the enslaving[]{#calibre_link-2789} power rather
than "disinterested" science, according to the distinction he seems to
hold, Lévi-Strauss now can, in a second wave of meditation, neutralize
the frontier between peoples without and with writing; not with regard
to the use of writing, but with regard to what is supposed to be
deducible from it, with regard to their historicity or nonhistoricity.
This neutralization is very valuable;[]{#calibre_link-2790} it
authorizes the themes (a) of the essential and irreducible relativity in
the perception of historical movement (cf. *Race et Histoire*), (b) of
the differences between "warm" and "cold" in the "historical
temperature" of societies (*Conversations*, p. 43 \[pp. 38--39\] and
passim), (c) of the relationships between anthropology and
history.^[]{#calibre_link-683}[24](#calibre_link-320){.nounder}^

Thus, given this trust in the presumed difference
between[]{#calibre_link-2791} knowledge and power, it is a matter of
showing that writing is not at all pertinent to the appreciation of
historical rhythms and types; the age of the wholesale creation of
social, economic, technical, political, and other structures, upon which
we still subsist---the neolithic age---did not know
writing.^[]{#calibre_link-684}[25](#calibre_link-321){.nounder}^ What
does this imply?

In the text that follows, I shall isolate three potentially
controversial[]{#calibre_link-2792} propositions. I shall not engage in
the controversy, because I want to proceed more quickly to the end of
the argument that interests Lévi-Strauss and to situate the debate
there.

*First Proposition*.

After eliminating all the criteria by which people habitually
distinguish civilization from barbarism, this one should at least be
retained: that certain peoples write and others do not. The
first[]{#calibre_link-2793} group can accumulate a body of knowledge
\[earlier acquisitions---*acquisitions anciennes\]* that helps it to
move ever faster toward the goal that it has assigned to itself; the
second is confined within limits that the memory of individuals can
never hope to extend, and it must remain the prisoner of a history
worked out from day to day, with neither an origin nor the lasting
consciousness of a plan.[]{#calibre_link-2794} Yet nothing of what we
know of writing, or of its role in evolution, can be said to justify
this conception \[p. 291\].

This proposition has meaning only on two conditions:

1\. That one take no notice of the idea and the project of science, of
the idea, that is, of truth as a theoretically infinite
transmissibility; this has an historical possibility only with writing.
Faced with the Husserlian[]{#calibre_link-2795} analyses (*Krisis* and
*The Origin of Geometry*) which remind us of this evidence,
Lévi-Strauss's proposal can be sustained only by denying all specificity
[]{#calibre_link-2796}to the scientific project and to the value of
truth in general. This last position does not lack force, but it cannot
show the worth and coherence of that force except by relinquishing its
claim to be a scientific discourse. A well-known
pattern.[]{#calibre_link-2797} It is in *fact* what seems to be
happening here.

2\. That the Neolithic, to which in fact may be attributed the creation
of the deep structures upon which we still live, did not know anything
like writing. It is here that the concept of writing, as it is used by a
modern anthropologist, would seem singularly narrow. Anthropology today
gives us a great deal of information about scripts that
preceded[]{#calibre_link-2798} the alphabet, about other systems of
phonetic writing or systems quite ready to be phoneticized. The weight
of this information makes it unnecessary for us to insist.

*Second Proposition*. Supposing every thing was acquired before writing,
Lévi-Strauss has only to argue:

Conversely, between the invention of writing and the birth of modern
science, the western world has lived through some
five[]{#calibre_link-2799} thousand years, during which time the sum of
its knowledge has rather *gone up and down* than known *a steady
increase* \[p. 292\] (italics added).

One could be shocked by this affirmation, but I shall avoid that. I do
not believe that such an affirmation is *false*. But no more do I
believe that it is *true*. It is rather an answer, suiting a particular
purpose, to a meaningless
question.^[]{#calibre_link-685}[26](#calibre_link-322){.nounder}^ Is not
the[]{#calibre_link-2800} notion of the quantity of knowledge suspect?
What is a quantity of knowledge? How is it modified? Without speaking of
the science of order or of quality, we may wonder what the quantity of
the science of pure quantity signifies. How can it be evaluated in
quantity? Such questions can only be answered in the style of pure
empiricity. Unless one attempts to respect the very complex laws of the
capitalization[]{#calibre_link-2801} of learning, something that cannot
be done without considering writing more attentively. One can say the
opposite of what Lévi-Strauss says and it would be neither truer nor
more false. One can say that during such and such a half-century, even
before "modern science," and today every minute, the accretion of
knowledge has gone infinitely beyond what it was for millennia. So much
for accretion.[]{#calibre_link-2802} As for the notion of fluctuation,
it presents itself as perfectly empirical. In any case, propositions of
essence can never be made to fit a scale.

*Third Proposition*. It is the most disconcerting step in the
development of this paragraph. Let us suppose that the advent of writing
three or four thousand years ago had brought nothing decisive in the
domain of knowledge. Lévi-Strauss concedes
nevertheless[]{#calibre_link-2803} that it has not at all been the same
thing for the last two centuries. However, according to his own scale,
it is not clear what justifies this cut-off point. Yet it is there:
"Doubtless the scientific expansion of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries could hardly []{#calibre_link-2804}have occurred, had writing
not existed. But this condition, however necessary, cannot in itself
explain that expansion" \[p. 292\]

[]{#calibre_link-2805}Not only is the cut-off point surprising, but one
also wonders what particular objection Lévi-Strauss seems to reject
here. No one has ever thought that writing---the written notation, since
that is at issue here---was the sufficient condition of science; and
that it would suffice to know how to write in order to be learned. Much
has been written that would suffice to rid us of this illusion if we
possessed[]{#calibre_link-2806} it. But to recognize that writing is the
"necessary condition" of science, that there is no science without
writing, is what is important, and Lévi-Strauss knows this. And as it is
difficult in any rigorous way to place the beginnings of science in the
nineteenth century, his entire argument founders on or is contaminated
by the gross mark of empirical approximation.

In truth this depends---and[]{#calibre_link-2807} that is why I pass
over this argument quickly---on the fact that Lévi-Strauss is determined
to abandon this terrain, to explain very quickly why the problem of
science is not the best access to the origin and function of writing:
"If we want to correlate the appearance of writing with certain other
characteristics of civilization, we must look elsewhere" \[p. 292\].
Thus it must rather be demonstrated[]{#calibre_link-2808} that,
according to the dissociation which had perplexed us, the origin of
writing responded to a more "sociological" than "intellectual"
necessity. The following page must therefore not only make clear this
sociological necessity---which would be a poor truism and would have
little enough to do with the sociological specificity of writing---but
also that this social necessity is that of
"domination,"[]{#calibre_link-2809} "exploitation," "enslavement," and
"perfidy."

To read this page appropriately, one must differentiate it into its
strata. The author presents here what he calls his "hypothesis:" "If my
hypothesis is correct, the primary function of writing, as a means of
communication, is to
facilitate^[]{#calibre_link-686}[27](#calibre_link-323){.nounder}^ the
enslavement of other human beings." On a first level, this hypothesis is
so quickly confirmed that it[]{#calibre_link-2810} hardly merits its
name. These facts are well known. It has long been known that the power
of writing in the hands of a small number, caste, or class, is always
contemporaneous with hierarchization, let us say with political
differance; it is at the same time distinction into groups, classes, and
levels of economico-politico-technical power, and delegation of
authority, power deferred and abandoned[]{#calibre_link-2811} to an
organ of capitalization. This phenomenon is produced from the very onset
of sedentarization; with the constitution of stocks at the origin of
agricultural societies. Here things are so
patent^[]{#calibre_link-687}[28](#calibre_link-324){.nounder}^ that the
empirical illustration that Lévi-Strauss sketches could be infinitely
enriched. This entire structure appears as soon as a society begins to
live as a society, that is to say from the origin[]{#calibre_link-2812}
of life in general, when, at very heterogeneous levels of organization
and complexity, it is possible to *defer presence*, that is to say
*expense* or consumption, and to organize production, that is to say
[]{#calibre_link-2813}*reserve* in general. This is produced well before
the appearance of writing in the narrow sense, but it is true, and one
cannot ignore it, that the appearance of certain systems of writing
three[]{#calibre_link-2814} or four thousand years ago was an
extraordinary leap in the history of life. All the more extraordinary
because a prodigious expansion of the power of differance was not
accompanied, at least during these millennia, by any notable
transformation of the organism. It is precisely the property of the
power of differance to modify life less and less as it spreads out more
and more. If it should grow[]{#calibre_link-2815} *infinite*---and its
essence excludes this a priori---life itself would be made into an
impassive, intangible, and eternal presence: infinite differance, God or
death.

This leads us to a second level of reading. It will show, at the same
time, Lévi-Strauss's final intention, toward which the demonstration
orients the factual evidence, as well as the political ideology that, in
the name of a Marxist[]{#calibre_link-2816} hypothesis, is articulated
with the finest example of what I have called the "metaphysics of
presence."

Previously the empirical character of the analyses concerning the status
of science and the accumulation of knowledge removed all rigor from each
of the propositions advanced and permitted their consideration with an
equal pertinence as true or false. It is the pertinence of the question
which[]{#calibre_link-2817} appeared doubtful. The same thing happens
here again. What is going to be called *enslavement* can equally
legitimately be called *liberation*. And it is at the moment that this
oscillation is *stopped* on the signification of enslavement that the
discourse is frozen into a determined ideology that we would judge
disturbing if such were our first preoccupation here.

In this text, Lévi-Strauss does[]{#calibre_link-2818} not distinguish
between hierarchization and domination, between political authority and
exploitation. The tone that pervades these reflections is of an
anarchism that deliberately confounds law and oppression. The idea of
law and positive right, although it is difficult to think them in their
formality---where it is so general that ignorance of the law is no
defense---before the possibility of writing,[]{#calibre_link-2819} is
determined by Lévi-Strauss as constraint and enslavement. Political
power can only be the custodian of an unjust power. A classical and
coherent thesis, but here advanced as self-evident, without opening the
least bit of critical dialogue with the holders of the other thesis,
according to which the generality of the law is on the contrary the
condition of liberty in the city. No dialogue, for[]{#calibre_link-2820}
example, with Rousseau who would no doubt have shuddered to see a
self-proclaimed disciple define law as follows:

Writing may not have sufficed to consolidate human knowledge, but it may
well have been indispensable to the consolidation of dominions. To bring
the matter nearer to our own time: the European-wide movement towards
compulsory education in the nineteenth century went hand in
hand[]{#calibre_link-2821} with the extension of military service and
with proletarization. The struggle against illiteracy is thus
indistinguishable from the increased powers exerted over the individual
[]{#calibre_link-103}citizen by the central authority. For it is only
when everyone can read that Authority can decree that "ignorance of law
is no defence."^[]{#calibre_link-688}[29](#calibre_link-325){.nounder}^

One must be careful in order to appreciate these grave declarations. One
must above[]{#calibre_link-2822} all avoid reversing them and taking the
opposite view. In a certain given historical structure---for example, in
the age of which Lévi-Strauss speaks---it is undoubtedly true that the
progress of formal legality, the struggle against illiteracy, and the
like, could have functioned as a mystifying force and an instrument
consolidating the power of a class or a state whose formal-universal
significance[]{#calibre_link-2823} was confiscated by a particular
empirical force. Perhaps this necessity is indispensable and impossible
to supersede. But to derive from it the authority to define the law and
the state in a simple and univocal manner, to condemn them from an
ethical point of view, and with them the extension of writing,
compulsory military service and proletarization, the generality of
political obligation and[]{#calibre_link-2824} the idea that "ignorance
of the law is no defense," is a consequence that cannot be rigorously
deduced from these premises. If they are nevertheless deduced, as here,
it must also be concluded that nonexploitation, liberty and the like "go
hand in hand" (to utilize this most equivocal concept) with illiteracy
and the absence of compulsory military service, public instruction or
law in general.[]{#calibre_link-2825} I shall not belabor the obvious.

Let us beware of opposing Lévi-Strauss to the system of classical
arguments, or of opposing him to himself (on the preceding page, he had
linked the violence of writing to the fact that it was reserved for a
minority, confiscated by the scribes in the service of a caste. Now, an
enslaving violence is assigned to total literacy.) The incoherence is
only apparent;[]{#calibre_link-2826} universality is always monopolized
as empirical force by a determined empirical force, such is the unique
affirmation that is common to both these propositions.

In order to tackle this problem, should one wonder what the meaning of
enslavement to a law of universal form can be? One could do it, but it
is better to give up that classical course; it would soon enough show us
that the access to[]{#calibre_link-2827} writing is the constitution of
a free subject in the violent movement of its own effacement and of its
own bondage. A movement unthinkable within the classical concepts of
ethics, psychology, political philosophy, and metaphysics. Let us leave
that proposition up in the air, for we have not yet finished reading the
writing "Lesson."

For Lévi-Strauss goes further under the auspices of this
libertarian[]{#calibre_link-2828} ideology, whose anticolonialist and
antiethnocentric hue is rather specific:

All this moved rapidly from the national to the international level,
thanks to the mutual complicity which sprang up between new-born
states---confronted as these were with the problems that had been our
own, a century or two ago---and []{#calibre_link-1055}an international
society of peoples long privileged. These latter recognize that
their[]{#calibre_link-2829} stability may well be endangered by nations
whose knowledge of the written word has not, as yet, empowered them to
think in formulae which can be modified at will. Such nations are not
yet ready to be "edified;" and when they are first given the freedom of
the library shelves *\[au savoir* entassé *dans les bibliothèques\]*
they are perilously vulnerable to the ever more deliberately misleading
(mendacious---*[]{#calibre_link-2830}mensonges\]* effects of the printed
word (italics added).

Taking the same precautions that we took a moment ago with respect to
the possible truthfulness of such statements, let us paraphrase this
text. It is, in the name of the liberty of formerly colonized peoples, a
critique of the young states that side with the old states so recently
denounced ("complicity ... between young states ... and an
international[]{#calibre_link-2831} society of peoples long
privileged"). Critique of an "enterprise:" the propagation of writing is
presented through the concepts of a voluntarist psychology, the
international political phenomenon that it constitutes is described in
terms of a deliberately and consciously organized plot. A critique of
the State in general and of the young States that extend writing for
propagandistic ends,[]{#calibre_link-2832} to assure the legibility and
effectiveness of their tracts, to protect themselves from "nations whose
knowledge of the written word has not, as yet, empowered them to think
in formulae which can be modified at will." Which implies that oral
formulae are not modifiable, not more modifiable at will than written
formulae. This is not the least of the paradoxes. Yet once again, I do
not profess that[]{#calibre_link-2833} writing may not and does not in
fact play this role, but from that to attribute to writing the
specificity of this role and to conclude that speech is exempt from it,
is an abyss that one must not leap over so lightly. I shall not comment
on what is said about access to "\[knowledge *piled up on\]* library
shelves," determined in an unequivocal way as vulnerability to the
"mendacious effects of the[]{#calibre_link-2834} printed word" and so
on. The ideological atmosphere within which such formulae breathe
*today* could be described. Suffice it to recognize here the heritage of
the second *Discourse* ("throwing aside, therefore, all those scientific
books ... and contemplating the first and most simple operations of the
human soul ..." \[p. 157\] "O man, ... behold your history, such as I
have thought to read it, not in books[]{#calibre_link-2835} written by
your fellow-creatures, who are liars, but in nature, which never lies"
\[p. 176\]), of *Emile* ("The misuse of books is the death of learning
..." "... so many books lead us to neglect the book of the world ..."
"... we should not read, but rather look." "I get rid of the chief cause
of their sorrows, namely their books. Reading is the curse of
childhood." "The child who reads ceases to think,"[]{#calibre_link-2836}
etc.), of A *Savoyard Priest* ("So I closed all my books..."), (pp. 574,
575, 186, 378) \[pp. 414, 415, 131, 270\] of the *Lettre à Christophe de
Beaumont* []{#calibre_link-2837}("I looked for truth in books: I found
in them nothing but lies and
error").[]{#calibre_link-1167}[\*](#calibre_link-326){.nounder}

After this nocturnal meditation, Lévi-Strauss returns to the
"extraordinary incident." And it is to give praise, now justified by
history, to those wise Nambikwara who had[]{#calibre_link-2838} the
courage to resist writing as well as the mystification of their leader.
Praise to those who knew to interrupt---only for a time, alas---the
fatal course of evolution and who "\[won\] themselves a respite." In
this respect and with regard to what concerns Nambikwara society, the
anthropologist is resolutely conservative. As he will note about a
hundred pages later, "at home, the anthropologist
may[]{#calibre_link-2839} be a natural subversive, a convinced opponent
of traditional usage: but no sooner has he in focus a society different
from his own than he becomes respectful of even the most conservative
practices" \[p. 380\].

Two motifs in the concluding lines: on the one hand, as with Rousseau,
the theme of a necessary or rather fatal degradation, as the very form
of progress; on the other hand, nostalgia for[]{#calibre_link-2840} what
preceded this degradation, an affective impulse toward the islets of
resistance, the small communities that have provisionally protected
themselves from corruption (cf. *Conversations*, p. 49 \[p. 41\] on this
subject), a corruption linked, as in Rousseau, to writing and to the
dislocation of a unanimous people assembled in the self-presence of its
speech. We shall return to this. Let us read:[]{#calibre_link-2841}
"Doubtless the die is already cast" (the question here is the fatal
evolution into which peoples who were hitherto protected from writing
are already seduced; a more fatalistic than determinable proposition.
The historical concatenation is thought under the concept of play and
chance. The frequent metaphor of the player in Lévi-Strauss's texts must
be studied). "But in *my* Nambikwara village
people[]{#calibre_link-2842} \[in the original *"fortes têtes,"*
"strong-minded people"\] were not so easily taken in" (italics added).

These strong-minded people are the resisters, those whom their leader
could not trick, and who have more character than subtlety, more heart
and traditional pride than openness of mind.

Those who moved away from him, after he had tried to play the civilized
man (after my visit he was abandoned[]{#calibre_link-2843} by most of
his followers), must have had a confused understanding of the fact that
writing, on this its first appearance in their midst, had allied itself
with falsehood; and so they had taken refuge, deeper in the bush, to win
themselves a respite \[p. 293\].

(The episode of this resistance is also given in the thesis, p. 89.)

1.---If words have a meaning, and if "writing, on this its first
appearance[]{#calibre_link-2844} in their midst, had allied itself with
falsehood," one should think that deception and all the associated
values and nonvalues were absent in societies
[]{#calibre_link-2845}without writing. To doubt this it is not necessary
to cover a lot of ground; only an empirical detour by the evocation of
facts, the aprioric or transcendental regression that we followed by way
of introduction. Recalling in this introduction
that[]{#calibre_link-2846} violence did not wait for the appearance of
writing in the narrow sense, that writing has always begun in language,
we, like Lévi-Strauss, conclude that violence is writing. But, coming at
it another way, this proposition has a radically different meaning. It
ceases to be supported by the myth of myth, by the myth of a speech
originally good, and of a violence which would come to pounce upon
it[]{#calibre_link-2847} as a fatal accident. A fatal accident which is
nothing but history itself. Not that, by this more or less overt
reference to the idea of a fall into evil from the innocence of the
word, Lévi-Strauss makes this classical and implicit theology his own.
It is just that his anthropological discourse is produced through
concepts, schemata, and values that are, systematically and
genealogically, accomplices[]{#calibre_link-2848} of this theology and
this metaphysics.

Therefore I shall not make the long empirical or aprioric disgression
here. I shall merely compare different moments in the description of
Nambikwara society. If the "Lesson" is to be believed, the Nambikwara
did not know violence before writing; nor hierarchization, since that is
quickly assimilated into exploitation. Round about the "Lesson," it
suffices[]{#calibre_link-2849} to open *Tristes Tropiques* and the
thesis at any page to find striking evidence to the contrary. We are
dealing here not only with a strongly hierarchized society, but with a
society where relationships are marked with a spectacular violence. As
spectacular as the innocent and tender frolics evoked at the beginning
of the "Lesson," and that we were thus justified in considering as the
calculated[]{#calibre_link-2850} premises of a loaded argument.

Among many analogous passages that we cannot cite here, let us look at
[page 87](#calibre_link-327){.nounder} of the dissertation. The subject
is clearly the Nambikwara before writing:

And the leader must display an unfailing talent, related more to
electoral politics than to the exercise of power, to maintain his group,
and, if possible, enlarge it through new memberships. The nomadic
band[]{#calibre_link-2851} represents in fact a fragile unity. If the
leader's authority is too exacting, if he monopolizes too great a number
of women, if he is not capable---during periods of dearth---of resolving
problems of food, discontent arises, individuals or families break away
and conglomerate into a kindred group whose affairs seem better
conducted; better nourished due to the discovery of hunting- or
fruit-and-berry-picking[]{#calibre_link-2852} grounds, or richer through
exchange with neighboring groups, or more powerful after victorious
battles. The leader then finds himself at the head of too limited a
group, incapable of facing daily difficulties, or whose women are open
to rape by stronger neighbors. He is then obliged to abdicate, and with
his last faithful friends, to throw in his lot with a more fortunate
faction; Nambikwara[]{#calibre_link-2853} society is thus in a perpetual
state of flux; groups form and unform, enlarge and disappear
[]{#calibre_link-1036}and, sometimes at intervals of a few months, the
composition, number, and regrouping of the bands become unrecognizable.
All these transformations are accompanied by intrigues and conflicts,
rises and falls, all being produced at an extremely fast pace.

One could also cite entire chapters of the thesis[]{#calibre_link-2854}
entitled "War and Commerce," and "From Birth to Death." Also everything
concerning the use of poisons, in the thesis and in *Tristes Tropiques;*
just as there is a battle of proper names, there is a battle of poisons
in which the anthropologist is himself embroiled:

A delegation of four men came to me and, in a quite threatening tone,
asked me to mix poison (which they brought me at the same
time)[]{#calibre_link-2855} with the next dish that I should offer to
A6; it was considered indispensable to suppress him rapidly, because, I
was told, he was "very wicked" (kakore) "and totally worthless"
(aidotiene) (p. 124).

I shall cite only one more passage, happy complement of an idyllic
description:

I have described the tender comradeship which presides over the
relationship between the sexes, and the general
harmony[]{#calibre_link-2856} which reigns in the bosom of the groups.
But as soon as these change for the worse, it is to make room for the
most extreme solutions: poisonings and assassinations. ... No South
American group, to our knowledge, conveys in so sincere and spontaneous
a manner ... violent and opposed sentiments, whose individual expression
seems indissociable from a social stylization that never betrays them
(p.[]{#calibre_link-2857} 126).

(Is this final formula not applicable to all social groups in general?)

2.---Thus we are led back to Rousseau. The ideal profoundly underlying
this philosophy of writing is therefore the image of a community
immediately present to itself, without difference, a community of speech
where all the members are within earshot. To confirm this, I shall refer
neither to *Tristes Tropiques* nor to[]{#calibre_link-2858} its
theoretical echo (the *Conversations*), but to a text included in
*Structural Anthropology* and completed in 1958 with allusions to
*Tristes Tropiques*. Writing is here defined as the condition of *social
inauthenticity:*

In this respect it is, rather, modern societies that should be defined
by a privative character. Our relations with one another are now only
occasionally and fragmentarily based[]{#calibre_link-2859} upon global
experience, *the concrete "apprehension" of one person by another*. They
are largely the result of a \[indirect\] construction, through written
documents. We are no longer linked to our past by an oral tradition
which implies *direct \[vécu\] contact* with others (storytellers,
priests, wise men, or elders), but by books *amassed* in libraries,
books from which criticism endeavors---with
extreme[]{#calibre_link-2860} difficulty---to form a picture of their
authors. And we communicate with the immense majority of our
contemporaries by all kinds of intermediaries---written documents or
administrative machinery---which undoubtedly
[]{#calibre_link-1077}vastly extend our contacts but at the same time
make those contacts somewhat *"unauthentic."* This has become typical of
the relationship between the citizen and the public authorities.
We[]{#calibre_link-2861} should like to avoid describing negatively the
tremendous revolution brought about by the invention of writing. But it
is essential to realize that writing, while it conferred vast benefits
on humanity, did in. fact deprive it of something fundamental. (pp.
400--02; italics added) \[pp. 363--64\]

From then on, the anthropologist's mission carries an ethical
significance: to find and fix on that terrain[]{#calibre_link-2862} the
"levels of authenticity." The criterion of authenticity is the
"neighborliness" in the small communities where "everyone knows everyone
else."

On the contrary, if we carefully consider the points on which
anthropological investigations have been brought to bear, we note that
in its increasingly intensive study of modern societies, anthropology
has endeavored to identify *levels of
authenticity*[]{#calibre_link-2863} within them. When the ethnologist
studies a village, an enterprise, or the neighborhood of a large town,
his task is facilitated by the fact that almost everyone knows everyone
else. ... In the future, it will no doubt be recognized that
anthropology's most important contribution to social sciences is to have
introduced, if unknowingly, this fundamental distinction between two
types of social existence:[]{#calibre_link-2864} a way of life
recognized at the outset as traditional and archaic and characteristic
of "authentic" societies and a more modern form of existence, from which
the first-named type is not absent but where groups that are not
completely, or are imperfectly, "authentic" are organized within a much
larger and specifically "unauthentic" system (pp. 402--03) \[pp.
364--65\].

The clarity of this text is[]{#calibre_link-2865} sufficient unto
itself. "In the future, it may be recognized" if this is in fact
"anthropology's most important contribution to social science." This
model of a small community with a "crystalline" structure, completely
self-present, assembled in its own neighborhood, is undoubtedly
Rousseauistic.

We shall have to examine this very closely in more than one text. For
the moment, and always for[]{#calibre_link-2866} the same reasons, let
us rather turn to the *Essay*. Rousseau shows there that social
*distance*, the dispersion of the neighborhood, is the condition of
oppression, arbitrariness, and vice. The governments of oppression all
make the same gesture: to break presence, the copresence of citizens,
the unanimity of "assembled peoples," to create a situation of
dispersion, holding subjects so far apart[]{#calibre_link-2867} as to be
incapable of feeling themselves together in the space of one and the
same speech, one and the same persuasive exchange. This phenomenon is
described in the last chapter of the *Essay*. The now recognized
ambiguity of this structure is such that one can equally well reverse
its direction and show that this copresence is sometimes also that of
the crowd subjected to a demagogic harangue.[]{#calibre_link-2868} We
must attend to the signs of Rousseau's vigilance when confronted by the
possibility of such a reversal. Nevertheless, the *Essay* first
[]{#calibre_link-896}puts us on guard against the structures of social
life and of information within the modern political machine. It is a
praise of eloquence or rather of the elocution of the full speech, a
condemnation of mute and impersonal signs: money, tracts
("placards"),[]{#calibre_link-2869} weapons and soldiers in uniform:

The languages develop naturally on the basis of men's needs, changing
and varying as those needs change. In ancient times, when persuasion
played the role of public force, eloquence was necessary. Of what use
would it be today, when public force has replaced persuasion. One needs
neither art nor metaphor to say *such is my pleasure*. What sort of
public discourses[]{#calibre_link-2870} remain then? Sermons. And why
should those who preach them be concerned to persuade the people, since
it is not they who dispose of benefices. Our popular tongues have become
just as completely useless as eloquence. Societies have assumed their
final form: no longer is anything changed except by arms and cash. And
since there is nothing to say to people besides *give money*, it is said
with placards[]{#calibre_link-2871} on street corners or by soldiers in
their homes. It is not necessary to assemble anyone for that. On the
contrary, the subjects must be kept apart. That is the first maxim of
modern politics. ... It was easy for the ancients to make themselves
understood by people in public. They could speak all day with no
discomfort. ... If a man were to harangue the people of Paris in the
Place Vendôme in French,[]{#calibre_link-2872} if he shouted at the top
of his voice, people would hear him shouting, but they would not be able
to distinguish a word. ... If charlatans are less common in the public
squares of France than in those of Italy, it is not because they would
be less well heard *\[écoutés\]* in France, but only because they would
not be as well understood *\[entendus\]*. ... But I say that any tongue
with which one cannot make[]{#calibre_link-2873} oneself understood to
the people assembled is a slavish tongue. It is impossible for a people
to remain free and speak the tongue (Chap. 10, "Relationship of
Langauges to Government") \[pp. 72--73\].

Self-presence, transparent proximity in the face-to-face of countenances
and the immediate range of the voice, this determination of social
authenticity is therefore classic: Rousseauistic but
already[]{#calibre_link-2874} the inheritor of Platonism, it relates, we
recall, to the Anarchistic and Libertarian protestations against Law,
the Powers, and the State in general, and also with the dream of the
nineteenth-century Utopian Socialisms, most specifically with the dream
of Fourierism. In his laboratory, or rather in his studio, the
anthropologist too uses this dream, as one weapon or instrument among
others. Serving[]{#calibre_link-2875} the same obstinate desire within
which the anthropologist "always puts something of himself," this tool
must come to terms with other "means to hand." For the anthropologist
also desires to be Freudian, Marxist (with a "Marxism," as we recall,
whose work of criticism would be neither in "opposition" nor in
"contradiction" with "Buddhist criticism") and he even confesses to
being tempted by "vulgar[]{#calibre_link-2876}
materialism."^[]{#calibre_link-689}[30](#calibre_link-328){.nounder}^

The only weakness of *bricolage*---but, seen as a weakness is it not
irremediable?---is a total inability to justify itself in its own
discourse. The []{#calibre_link-986}already-there-ness of instruments
and of concepts cannot be undone or reinvented. In that sense, the
passage from desire to discourse always loses itself in *bricolage*, it
builds its castles with debris ("Mythical thought ... builds
ideological[]{#calibre_link-2877} castles out of the debris of what was
once a social discourse." *The Savage Mind*, p. 32 \[p. 21\]). In the
best of cases, the discourse of *bricolage* can confess itself, confess
in itself its desire and its defeat, provoke the thought of the essence
and the necessity of the already-there, recognize that the most radical
discourse, the most inventive and systematic engineer are surprised and
circumvented[]{#calibre_link-2878} by a history, a language, etc., a
*world* (for "world" means nothing else) from which they must borrow
their tools, if only to destroy the former machine (the strop-catapult
*\[bricole\]* seems originally to have been a machine of war or the
hunt, constructed to destroy. And who can believe the image of the
peaceful *bricoleur?*). The idea of the engineer breaking with all
*bricolage* is dependent on a[]{#calibre_link-2879} creationist
theology. Only such a theology can sanction an essential and rigorous
difference between the engineer and the *bricoleur*. But that the
engineer should always be a sort of *bricoleur* should not ruin all
criticism of *bricolage;* quite the contrary. Criticism in what sense?
First of all, if the difference between *bricoleur* and engineer is
basically theological, the very concept of
*bricolage*[]{#calibre_link-2880} implies a fall and an accidental
finitude. This techno-theological significance must be abandoned in
order to think the originary appurtenance of desire to discourse, of
discourse to the history of the world, and the already-three-ness of the
language in which desire deludes itself. Then, even supposing that, by
*bricolage*, one conserves the idea of *bricolage*, one must know that
all *bricolages*[]{#calibre_link-2881} are not equally worthwhile.
*Bricolage* criticizes itself.

Finally, the value of "social authenticity" is one of the two
indispensable poles of the structure of morality in general. The ethic
of the living word would be perfectly respectable, completely utopian
and a-topic *\[utopique et atopique\]* as it is (unconnected to
*spacing* and to differance as writing), it would be as respectable as
respect[]{#calibre_link-2882} itself if it did not live on a delusion
and a nonrespect for its own condition of origin, if it did not dream in
speech of a presence denied to writing, denied by writing. The ethic of
speech is the *delusion* of presence mastered. Like the *bricole*, the
delusion or lure designates first a hunter's stratagem. It is a term of
falconry: "a piece of red feather," says Littré, "in the form of a
bird,[]{#calibre_link-2883} which serves to recall the bird of prey when
it does not return straight to the fist." Example: "... the master
called, made a feint,/Held fist and lure toward what seemed turned to
stone, ..." (La Fontaine) *\[Fables*, XII, 12; *The Fables of La
Fontaine*, tr. Marianne Moore (New York, 1952), p. 294\].

To recognize writing in speech, that is to say differance and the
absence of speech, is to begin to[]{#calibre_link-2884} think the lure.
There is no ethics without the []{#calibre_link-1078}presence *of the
other* but also, and consequently, without absence, dissimulation,
detour, differance, writing. The arche-writing is the origin of morality
as of immorality. The nonethical opening of ethics. A violent opening.
As in the case of the vulgar concept of writing, the ethical instance of
violence must be rigorously suspended in order to[]{#calibre_link-2885}
repeat the genealogy of morals.

Since they both scorn writing, Rousseau and Lévi-Strauss both praise the
range of the voice. Nevertheless, in the texts that we must now read,
Rousseau is suspicious also of the illusion of full and present speech,
of the illusion of presence within a speech believed to be transparent
and innocent. It is toward the praise of silence that the myth of a full
presence[]{#calibre_link-2886} wrenched from differance and from the
violence of the word is then deviated. Nevertheless, in a certain way,
"public force" has already begun to "compensate for *\[suppléer\]*
persuasion."

It is perhaps time to reread the *Essay on the Origin of Languages*.

### []{#calibre_link-1040 .calibre3}**2 *"... That Dangerous Supplement..."*** {#calibre_link-27 .h2}

***How people will cry out against me! I hear from afar the shouts of
that false wisdom which is ever dragging us onwards, counting the
present as nothing, and pursuing without a pause a future which flies as
we pursue, that false wisdom which removes us from our place and never
brings us to any other.---Emile***

***All the papers which I have collected to fill the
gaps[]{#calibre_link-2889} in my memory and to guide me in my
undertaking, have passed into other hands, and will never return to
mine.---Confessions***

I have implied it repeatedly: the praise of living speech, as it
*preoccupies* Lévi-Strauss's discourse, is faithful to only one
particular motif in Rousseau. This motif comes to terms with and is
organized by its contrary: a perpetually reanimated mistrust with regard
to the[]{#calibre_link-2890} so-called full speech. In the spoken
address, presence is at once promised and refused. The speech that
Rousseau raised above writing is speech as it should be or rather as it
*should have been*. And we must pay attention to that mode, to that
tense which relates us to presence within living colloquy. *In fact*,
Rousseau had tested the concealment within speech itself, in the mirage
of its immediacy.[]{#calibre_link-2891} He had recognized and analyzed
it with incomparable acumen. We are dispossessed of the longed-for
presence in the gesture of language by which we attempt to seize it. To
the experience of the "robber robbed" that Starobinski admirably
describes in *L'oeil vivant* \[Paris, 1961\]. Jean Jacques is subjected
not only in the play of the mirror image which "captures his reflection
and exposes his presence"[]{#calibre_link-2892} (p. 109). It lies in
wait for us from the first word. The speculary dispossession which at
the same time institutes and deconstitutes me is also a law of language.
It operates as a power of death in the heart of living speech: a power
all the more redoubtable because it opens as much as it threatens the
possibility of the spoken word.

Having in a certain way recognized this power which,
inaugurating[]{#calibre_link-2893} speech, dislocates the subject that
it constructs, prevents it from being present to its signs, torments its
language with a complete writing, Rousseau is nevertheless more pressed
to exorcise it than to assume its necessity. That is why, straining
toward the reconstruction of presence, he valorizes and
[]{#calibre_link-1098}disqualifies writing at the same time. At the same
time; that is to say, in one divided but[]{#calibre_link-2894} coherent
movement. We must try not to lose sight of its strange unity. Rousseau
condemns writing as destruction of presence and as disease of speech. He
rehabilitates it to the extent that it promises the reappropriation of
that of which speech allowed itself to be dispossessed. But by what, if
not already a writing older than speech and already installed in that
place?

The first movement of[]{#calibre_link-2895} this desire is formulated as
a theory of language. The other governs the experience of the writer. In
the *Confessions*, when Jean-Jacques tries to explain how he became a
writer, he describes the passage to writing as the restoration, by a
certain absence and by a sort of calculated effacement, of presence
disappointed of itself in speech. To write is indeed the only way of
keeping or recapturing[]{#calibre_link-2896} speech since speech denies
itself as it gives itself. Thus an *economy of signs* is organized. It
will be equally disappointing, closer yet to the very essence and to the
necessity of disappointment. One cannot help wishing to master absence
and yet we must always let go. Starobinski describes the profound law
that commands the space within which Rousseau must move:

How will he overcome the misunderstanding[]{#calibre_link-2897} that
prevents him from expressing himself according to his true value? How
escape the risks of improvised speech? To what other mode of
communication can he turn? By what other means manifest himself?
Jean-Jacques chooses to be *absent* and to *write*. Paradoxically, he
will hide himself to show himself better, and he will confide in written
speech: "I would love society like others, if I were
not[]{#calibre_link-2898} sure of showing myself not only at a
disadvantage, but as completely different from what I am. The part that
I have taken of *writing and hiding myself* is precisely the one that
suits me. If I were present, one would never know what I was worth"
(*Confessions*). The admission is singular and merits emphasis:
Jean-Jacques breaks with others, only to present himself to them in
written speech. Protected[]{#calibre_link-2899} by solitude, he will
turn and re-turn his sentences at
leisure.^[]{#calibre_link-690}[1](#calibre_link-330){.nounder}^

Let us note that the economy is perhaps indicated in the following: the
operation that substitutes writing for speech also replaces presence by
value: to the I *am* or to the I *am present* thus sacrificed, a *what*
I am or a *what I am worth* is *preferred*. "If I were present, one
would never know what I was worth." I renounce my
present[]{#calibre_link-2900} life, my present and concrete existence in
order to make myself known in the ideality of truth and value. A
wellknown schema. The battle by which I wish to raise myself above my
life even while I retain it, in order to enjoy recognition, is in this
case within myself, and writing is indeed the phenomenon of this battle.

Such would be the writing lesson in Jean-Jacque's existence. The act of
writing[]{#calibre_link-2901} would be essentially---and here in an
exemplary fashion---the greatest []{#calibre_link-949}sacrifice aiming
at the greatest symbolic reappropriation of presence. From this point of
view, Rousseau knew that death is not the simple outside of life. Death
by writing also inaugurates life. "I can certainly say that I never
began to live, until I looked upon myself as a dead man" (*Confessions*,
Book 6 \[p. 236\]). As soon as[]{#calibre_link-2902} one determines it
within the system of this economy, is not the sacrifice---the "literary
suicide"---dissipated in the *appearance?* Is it anything but a symbolic
reappropriation? Does it not renounce the *present* and the *proper* in
order to master them better in their meaning, in the ideal form of
truth, of the presence of the present and of the proximity or property
of the proper? We would be obliged[]{#calibre_link-2903} to decide that
a ruse and an appearance are necessary if in fact we were to abide by
these concepts (sacrifice, expenditure, renunciation, symbol,
appearance, truth, etc.) which determine what we here call economy in
terms of truth and appearance, starting from the opposition
presence/absence.

But the work of writing and the economy of differance will not be
dominated by this classical conceptuality,[]{#calibre_link-2904} this
ontology, or this epistemology. On the contrary, these furnish its
hidden premises. Differance does not *resist* appropriation, it does not
impose an exterior limit upon it. Differance began by *broaching*
alienation and it ends by leaving reappropriation *breached*. Until
death. Death is the movement of differance to the extent that that
movement is necessarily finite. This means that
differance[]{#calibre_link-2905} makes the opposition of presence and
absence possible. Without the possibility of differance, the desire of
presence as such would not find its breathing-space. That means by the
same token that this desire carries in itself the destiny of its
non-satisfaction. Differance produces what it forbids, makes possible
the very thing that it makes impossible.

If differance is recognized as the obliterated[]{#calibre_link-2906}
origin of absence and presence, major forms of the disappearing and the
appearing of the entity, it would still remain to be known if being,
before its determination into absence or presence, is already implicated
in the thought of differance. And if differance as the project of the
mastery of the entity should be understood with reference to the sense
of being. Can one not think the converse?[]{#calibre_link-2907} Since
the sense of being is never produced as history outside of its
determination as presence, has it not always already been caught within
the history of metaphysics as the epoch of presence? This is perhaps
what Nietzsche wanted to write and what resists the Heideggerian reading
of Nietzsche; *differance* in its *active* movement---*what* is
comprehended in the concept of *differance* without
exhausting[]{#calibre_link-2908} it---is what not only precedes
metaphysics but also extends beyond the thought of being. The latter
speaks *nothing other than* metaphysics, even if it exceeds it and
thinks it as what it is within its closure.

#### **[]{#calibre_link-1079}*From/Of Blindness to the Supplement*** {#calibre_link-28 .h3}

In terms of this problematical scheme, we must therefore think
Rousseau's experience and his theory of writing together, the accord and
the discord that,[]{#calibre_link-2909} under the name of writing,
relate Jean-Jacques to Rousseau, uniting and dividing his proper name.
On the side of experience, a recourse to literature as reappropriation
of presence, that is to say, as we shall see, of Nature; on the side of
theory, an indictment against the negativity of the letter, in which
must be read the degeneracy of culture and the disruption of the
community.

If indeed[]{#calibre_link-2910} one wishes to surround it with the
entire constellation of concepts that shares its system, the word
*supplement* seems to account for the strange unity of these two
gestures.

In both cases, in fact, Rousseau considers writing as a dangerous means,
a menacing aid, the critical response to a situation of distress. When
Nature, as self-proximity, comes to be forbidden or interrupted, when
speech[]{#calibre_link-2911} fails to protect presence, writing becomes
necessary. It must *be added* to the word urgently. I have identified in
advance one of the forms of this *addition;* speech being natural or at
least the natural expression of thought, the most natural form of
institution or convention for signifying thought, writing is added to
it, is adjoined, as an image or representation. In that sense, it is not
natural.[]{#calibre_link-2912} It diverts the immediate presence of
thought to speech into representation and the imagination. This recourse
is not only "bizarre," but dangerous. It is the addition of a technique,
a sort of artificial and artful ruse to make speech present when it is
actually absent. It is a violence done to the natural destiny of the
language:

Languages are made to be spoken, writing serves only as a
supplement[]{#calibre_link-2913} to speech. ... Speech represents
thought by conventional signs, and writing represents the same with
regard to speech. Thus the art of writing is nothing but a mediated
representation of thought.

Writing is dangerous from the moment that representation there claims to
be presence and the sign of the thing itself. And there is a fatal
necessity, inscribed in the very functioning of the sign,
that[]{#calibre_link-2914} the substitute make one forget the
vicariousness of its own function and make itself pass for the plenitude
of a speech whose deficiency and infirmity it nevertheless only
*supplements*. For the concept of the supplement---which here determines
that of the representative image---harbors within itself two
significations whose cohabitation is as strange as it is necessary. The
supplement adds itself,[]{#calibre_link-2915} it is a surplus, a
plenitude enriching another plenitude, the *fullest measure* of
presence. It cumulates and accumulates presence. It is thus that art,
*techn*è, image, representation, convention, etc., come as supplements
to []{#calibre_link-1064}nature and are rich with this entire cumulating
function. This kind of supplementarity determines in a certain way all
the conceptual oppositions within which Rousseau
inscribes[]{#calibre_link-2916} the notion of Nature to the extent that
it *should* be self-sufficient.

But the supplement supplements. It adds only to replace. It intervenes
or insinuates itself *in-the-place-of;* if it fills, it is as if one
fills a void. If it represents and makes an image, it is by the anterior
default of a presence. Compensatory *\[suppléant\]* and vicarious, the
supplement is an adjunct, a subaltern instance[]{#calibre_link-2917}
which *takes-(the)-place \[tient-lieu\]*. As substitute, it is not
simply added to the positivity of a presence, it produces no relief, its
place is assigned in the structure by the mark of an emptiness.
Somewhere, something can be filled up *of itself*, can accomplish
itself, only by allowing itself to be filled through sign and proxy. The
sign is always the supplement of the thing itself.

This second[]{#calibre_link-2918} signification of the supplement cannot
be separated from the first. We shall constantly have to confirm that
both operate within Rousseau's texts. But the inflexion varies from
moment to moment. Each of the two significations is by turns effaced or
becomes discreetly vague in the presence of the other. But their common
function is shown in this: whether it adds or substitutes itself, the
supplement[]{#calibre_link-2919} is *exterior*, outside of the
positivity to which it is super-added, alien to that which, in order to
be replaced by it, must be other than it. Unlike the *complement*,
dictionaries tell us, the supplement is an *"exterior* addition"
(Robert's *French Dictionary*).

According to Rousseau, the negativity of evil will always have the form
of supplementarity. Evil is exterior to nature, to what is by
nature[]{#calibre_link-2920} innocent and good. It supervenes upon
nature. But always by way of compensation for *\[sous l'espèce de la
suppléance\]* what *ought to* lack nothing at all in itself.

Thus presence, always natural, which for Rousseau more than for others
means maternal, *ought to be* self-sufficient. Its *essence*, another
name for presence, may be read through the grid of this ought to be
*\[ce conditionnel\]*. Like Nature's[]{#calibre_link-2921} love, "there
is no substitute for a mother's love," says
*Emile*.^[]{#calibre_link-691}[2](#calibre_link-331){.nounder}^ It is in
no way *supplemented*, that is to say it does not have to be
supplemented, it suffices and is self-sufficient; but that also means
that it is irreplacable; what one would substitute for it would not
equal it, would be only a mediocre makeshift. Finally it means that
Nature does not supplement *itself* at all; Nature's
supplement[]{#calibre_link-2922} does not proceed from Nature, it is not
only inferior to but other than Nature.

Yet all education, the keystone of Rousseauist thought, will be
described or presented as a system of substitution *\[suppléance\]*
destined to reconstitute Nature's edifice in the most natural way
possible. The first chapter of *Emile* announces the function of this
pedagogy. Although there is no []{#calibre_link-2923}substitute for a
mother's[]{#calibre_link-2924} love, "it is better that the child should
suck the breast of a healthy nurse rather than of a petted mother, if he
has any further evil to fear from her who has given him birth" (ibid.)
\[p. 12\]. It is indeed culture or cultivation that must supplement a
deficient nature, a deficiency that cannot by definition be anything but
an accident and a deviation from Nature. Culture or cultivation is
here[]{#calibre_link-2925} called habit; it is necessary and
insufficient from the moment when the substitution of mothers is no
longer envisaged only "from the physiological point of view":

Other women, or even other animals, may give him the milk she denies
him, but there is no substitute for a mother's love. The woman who
nurses another's child in place of her own is a bad mother; how can she
be a good nurse? She may[]{#calibre_link-2926} become one in time; use
\[habit\] will overcome nature ... (ibid.).

Here the problems of natural right, of the relationship between Nature
and Society, the concepts of alienation, alterity, and corruption, are
adapted most spontaneously to the pedagogic problem of the substitution
of mothers and children:

And this affection when developed has its drawbacks, which should make
every sensible woman[]{#calibre_link-2927} afraid to put her child out
to nurse. Is she prepared to divide her mother's rights, or rather to
abdicate them in favor of a stranger; to see her child loving another as
much as and more than herself ... (ibid.).

If, premeditating the theme of writing, I began by speaking of the
substitution of mothers, it is because, as Rousseau will himself say,
"more depends on this than you realize."

How[]{#calibre_link-2928} emphatically would I speak if it were not so
hopeless to keep struggling in vain on behalf of a real reform. More
depends on this than you realize. Would you restore all men to their
primal duties, begin with the mothers; the results will surprise you.
Every evil follows in the train of this first sin; the whole moral order
is disturbed, nature is quenched in every breast ... (p. 18) \[p. 13\].

[]{#calibre_link-2929}Childhood is the first manifestation of the
deficiency which, in Nature, calls for substitution *\[suppléance\]*.
Pedagogy illuminates perhaps more crudely the paradoxes of the
supplement. How is a natural weakness possible? How can Nature ask for
forces that it does not furnish? How is a child possible in general?

*First Maxim*.---Far from being too strong, children are not strong
enough for all the[]{#calibre_link-2930} claims of nature. Give them
full use of such strength as they have and which they will not abuse.
*Second Maxim*.---Help them and supply what they lack, in intelligence
or in strength, whenever the need is of the body (p. 50) \[P. 35\].

All the organization of, and all the time spent in, education will be
regulated by this necessary evil: "supply *\[suppléer\] ...* \[what\]
... is lacking" []{#calibre_link-1041}and to replace
Nature.[]{#calibre_link-2931} It must be done as little and as late as
possible. "One of the best rules of good farming *\[culture\]* is to
*keep things back* as much as possible" (p. 274) \[p. 193\]. "Give
nature time to work before you *take over her business* \[act in her
place---*agir à sa place\]"* (p. 102; italics added) \[p. 71\].

Without childhood, no supplement would ever appear in Nature. The
supplement is here both humanity's good[]{#calibre_link-2932} fortune
and the origin of its perversion. The health of the human race:

Plants are fashioned by cultivation, and men by education. If man were
born big and strong, his size and strength would be useless to him until
he had learned to use them; they would create a prejudice against him,
by not allowing others to think of assisting him; and, left to himself,
he would die miserably before knowing[]{#calibre_link-2933} his needs.
We complain of the state of infancy; we do not see that, if man had not
begun by being a child, the human race would have perished (p. 67).

The threat of perversion:

While the Author of nature has given children the active principle, He
takes care that it shall do little harm by giving them small power to
use it. But as soon as they can think of people as tools that they are
responsible[]{#calibre_link-2934} for activating, they use them to carry
out their wishes and to *supplement* their own weakness. This is how
they become tiresome, masterful, imperious, naughty, and unmanageable; a
development which does not spring from a natural love of power, but one
which gives it to them, for it does not need much experience to realize
how pleasant it is to act through the hands of others and to move the
world[]{#calibre_link-2935} by simply moving the tongue (p. 49; italics
added) \[p. 34\].

The supplement will always be the moving of the tongue or acting through
the hands of others. In it everything is brought together: progress as
the possibility of perversion, regression toward an evil that is not
natural and that adheres to the power of substitution that permits us to
asbent ourselves and act by proxy, through
representation,[]{#calibre_link-2936} through the hands of others.
Through the written *\[par écrit\]*. This substitution always has the
form of the sign. The scandal is that the sign, the image, or the
representer, become forces and make "the world move."

This scandal is such, and its evil effects are sometimes so irreparable,
that the world seems to turn the wrong way (and we shall see later what
such a *catastrophe* can signify for[]{#calibre_link-2937} Rousseau);
then Nature becomes the supplement of art and society. It is the moment
when evil seems incurable: "As the child does not know how to be cured,
let him know how to be ill. The one art takes the place of *\[supplée\]*
the other and is often more successful; it is the art of nature" (p. 31)
\[p. 22\]. It is also the moment when maternal nature, ceasing to be
loved, as she ought to be, for herself[]{#calibre_link-2938} and in an
immediate proximity ("O Nature! O my mother! behold me under thy
[]{#calibre_link-1047}protection alone! Here there is no cunning or
knavish mortal to thrust himself between me and thee." *\[Confession*,
Book 12\] \[p. 669\]) becomes the substitute for another love and for
another attachment:

The contemplation of Nature always had a very great attraction for his
heart; he found there a supplement to the
attachments[]{#calibre_link-2939} that he needed; but he would have left
the supplement for the thing, if he had had the choice, and he was
reduced to converse with the plants only after vain efforts to converse
with human beings (*Dialogues*, p. 794).

That botany becomes the supplement of society is more than a
catastrophe. It is the catastrophe of the catastrophe. For in Nature,
the plant is the most *natural* thing. It is
natural[]{#calibre_link-2940} *life*. The mineral is distinguished from
the vegetable in that it is a dead and useful Nature, servile to man's
industry. When man has lost the sense and the taste of true natural
riches---plants---he rummages in the entrails of his mother and risks
his health:

The Mineral Kingdom has nothing in itself either amiable or attractive;
its riches, enclosed in the breast \[womb---*sein\]* of the earth,
seem[]{#calibre_link-2941} to have been removed from the gaze of man in
order not to tempt his cupidity; they are there like a reserve to serve
one day as a *supplement* to the true wealth which is more within his
grasp, and for which he loses taste according to the extent of his
corruption. Then he is compelled to call in industry, to struggle, and
to labor to alleviate his miseries; he searches the entrails of earth;
he[]{#calibre_link-2942} goes seeking to its center, at the risk of his
life and at the expense of his health, for imaginary goods in place of
the real good which the earth offers of herself if he knew how to enjoy
it. *He flies from the sun and the day, which he is no longer worthy to
see.^[]{#calibre_link-692}[3](#calibre_link-332){.nounder}^*

Man has thus put out his eyes, he blinds himself by the desire to
rummage in these entrails. Here is the horrible spectacle of
the[]{#calibre_link-2943} punishment that follows the crime, in sum a
simple substitution:

He buries himself alive, and does well, not being worthy of living in
the light of day. There quarries, pits, forges, furnaces, a battery of
anvils, hammers, smoke and fire, succeed to the fair images of his
rustic labors. The wan faces of the unhappy people who languish in the
poisonous vapors of mines, of black forgemen, of
hideous[]{#calibre_link-2944} cyclops, are the spectacle which the
working of the mine substitutes, in the heart \[womb\] of the earth for
that of green fields and flowers, the azure sky, amorous shepherds and
robust laborers upon its
surface.^[]{#calibre_link-693}[4](#calibre_link-333){.nounder}^

Such is the scandal, such the catastrophe. The supplement is what
neither Nature nor Reason can tolerate. Neither Nature, our "common
mother" (*Reveries*, p. 1066) \[p. 143\], nor the
reason[]{#calibre_link-2945} which is reasonable, if not reasoning (*De
l'état de nature, \[Pléiade*, vol. 3\], p. 478). And had they not done
everything to avoid this catastrophe, to protect themselves from this
violence and to guard and keep us from this fatal crime? "so
[]{#calibre_link-2946}that," says the second *Discourse* precisely of
mines, "it looks as if nature had taken pains to keep the fatal secret
from us" (p. 172) \[p. 200\]. And let us[]{#calibre_link-2947} not
forget that the violence that takes us toward the entrails of the earth,
the moment of mine-blindness, that is, of metallurgy, is the origin of
society. For according to Rousseau, as we shall often confirm,
agriculture, marking the organization of civil society, assumes the
beginning of metallurgy. Blindness thus produces that which is born at
the same time as society: the languages, the
regulated[]{#calibre_link-2948} substitution of signs for things, the
order of the supplement. One goes *from blindness to the supplement*.
But the blind person cannot see, in its origin, the very thing he
produces to supplement his sight. *Blindness to the supplement* is the
law. And especially blindness to its concept. Moreover, it does not
suffice to locate its functioning in order to *see* its meaning. The
supplement has no sense[]{#calibre_link-2949} and is given to no
intuition. We do not therefore make it emerge out of its strange
penumbra. We speak its reserve.

Reason is incapable of thinking this double infringement upon Nature:
that there is *lack* in Nature and that *because of that very fact*
something *is added* to it. Yet one should not say that Reason is
*powerless to think this;* it is constituted by that lack of power. It
is the principle[]{#calibre_link-2950} of identity. It is the thought of
the self-identity of the natural being. It cannot even determine the
supplement as its other, as the irrational and the non-natural, for the
supplement comes *naturally* to put itself in Nature's place. The
supplement is the image and the representation of Nature. The image is
neither in nor out of Nature. The supplement is therefore equally
dangerous for Reason,[]{#calibre_link-2951} the natural health of
Reason.

Dangerous supplement. These are the words that Rousseau uses in the
*Confessions*. He uses them in a context which is only apparently
different, and in order to explain, precisely, a "condition almost
unintelligible and inconceivable \[to reason\]": "In a word, between
myself and the most passionate lover there was only one, but that an
essential, point of distinction,[]{#calibre_link-2952} which makes my
condition almost unintelligible and inconceivable" (*Pléiade*, vol. 1,
\[p. 111\]).

If we lend to the text below a paradigmatic value, it is only
provisional and does not prejudge what the discipline of a future
reading might rigorously determine. No model of reading seems to me at
the moment ready to measure up to this text---which I would like to read
as a *text* and not as a document.[]{#calibre_link-2953} Measure up to
it fully and rigorously, that is, beyond what already makes the text
most legible, and more legible than has been so far thought. My only
ambition will be to draw out of it a signification which that presumed
future reading will not be able to dispense with *\[faire économie\];*
the economy of a written text, circulating through other texts, leading
back to it constantly, conforming[]{#calibre_link-2954} to the element
of a language and to its regulated functioning. For example, what unites
the word "supplement" []{#calibre_link-1065}to its concept was not
invented by Rousseau and the originality of its functioning is neither
fully mastered by Rousseau nor simply imposed by history and the
language, by the history of the language. To speak of the writing of
Rousseau is to try to recognize what escapes these
categories[]{#calibre_link-2955} of passivity and activity, blindness
and responsibility. And one cannot abstract from the written text to
rush to the signified it *would mean*, since the signified is here the
text itself. It is so little a matter of looking for a *truth signified*
by these writings (metaphysical or psychological truth: Jean-Jacque's
life behind his work) that if the texts that interest us *mean*
something, it is the[]{#calibre_link-2956} engagement and the
appurtenance that encompass existence and writing in the same *tissue*,
the same *text*. The same is here called supplement, another name for
differance.

Here is the irruption of the dangerous supplement in Nature, between
nature and nature, between natural innocence as *virginity* and natural
innocence as
*pucelage[]{#calibre_link-1169}[\*](#calibre_link-334){.nounder}*: "In a
word, between myself and the most passionate lover
there[]{#calibre_link-2957} was only one, but that an essential, point
of distinction, which makes my condition almost unintelligible and
inconceivable." Here, the lineation should not hide the fact that the
following paragraph is destined to explain the "only one point of
distinction" and the "almost unintelligible and inconceivable"
"condition." Rousseau elaborates:

I had returned from Italy not quite the same as I
had[]{#calibre_link-2958} entered it, but as, perhaps, no one of my age
had ever returned from it. I had brought back, not my virginity but my
*pucelage*. I had felt the progress of years; my restless temperatment
had at last made itself felt, and its first outbreak, quite involuntary,
had caused me alarm about my health in a manner which shows better than
anything else the innocence in which I had lived up to that
time.[]{#calibre_link-2959} Soon reassured, I learned that dangerous
means of assisting it *\[ce dangereux supplément\]*, which cheats Nature
and saves up for young men of my temperment many forms of excess at the
expense of their health, strength, and, sometimes, their life
(*Pléiade*, I, pp. 108--09 \[p. 111\].

We read in *Emile* (Book IV): "If once he acquires this dangerous habit
*\[supplément\]* he is ruined" \[p. 299\]. In the
same[]{#calibre_link-2960} book, it is also a question of "mak\[ing\] up
... by trading on ... inexperience" *\[suppléer en gagnant de vitesse
sur l' experience;* literally "supplementing by out-distancing
experience"\] (p. 437) \[p. 315\], and of the "mind, which reinforces
*\[supplée\]* ... the bodily strength" (p. 183) \[p. 129\].

The experience of auto-eroticism is lived in anguish. Masturbation
reassures ("soon reassured") only through[]{#calibre_link-2961} that
culpability traditionally attached to the practice, obliging children to
assume the fault and to []{#calibre_link-2962}interiorize the threat of
castration that always accompanies it. Pleasure is thus lived as the
irremediable loss of the vital substance, as exposure to madness and
death. It is produced "at the expense of their health, strength, and,
sometimes, their life." In the same way, the *Reveries* will
say,[]{#calibre_link-2963} the man who "searches the entrails of earth
... goes seeking to its center, at the risk of his life and at the
expense of his health, for imaginary goods in place of the real good
which the earth offers of herself if he knew how to enjoy it."
(*Pléiade*, vol. 1, 1067 \[p. 145\]).

And indeed it is a question of the imaginary. The supplement that
"cheats" maternal "nature" operates as writing, and
as[]{#calibre_link-2964} writing it is dangerous to life. This danger is
that of the image. Just as writing opens the crisis of the living speech
in terms of its "image," its painting or its representation, so onanism
announces the ruin of vitality in terms of imaginary seductions:

This vice, which shame and timidity find so convenient, possesses,
besides a great attraction for lively imaginations---that of being
able[]{#calibre_link-2965} to dispose of the whole sex as they desire,
and to make the beauty which tempts them minister to their pleasures,
without being obliged to obtain its consent *\[Confessions*, p. 111\].

The dangerous supplement, which Rousseau also calls a "fatal advantage,"
is properly *seductive;* it leads desire away from the good path, makes
it err far from natural ways, guides it toward its loss or fall and
therefore[]{#calibre_link-2966} it is a sort of lapse or scandal
(*scandalon*). It thus destroys Nature. But the scandal of Reason is
that nothing seems more natural than this destruction of Nature. It is
myself who exerts myself to separate myself from the force that Nature
has entrusted to me: "Seduced by this fatal advantage, I did my best to
destroy the good constitution which Nature had restored to me, and
\[to\] which I had[]{#calibre_link-2967} allowed time to strengthen
itself." We know what importance *Emile* gives to time, to the slow
maturation of natural forces. The entire art of pedagogy is a calculated
patience, allowing the work of Nature time to come to fruition,
respecting its rhythm and the order of its stages. The dangerous
supplement destroys very quickly the forces that Nature has slowly
constituted and accumulated. In "out-distancing"[]{#calibre_link-2968}
natural experience, it runs non-stop *\[brûle les étapes*---literally
"burns the halting-points"\] and consumes energy without possibility of
recovery. As I shall confirm, like the sign it bypasses the presence of
the thing and the duration of being.

The dangerous supplement breaks with Nature. The entire description of
this moving away from Nature has a *scene \[théâtre\]*. The
*Confessions* stage the evocation[]{#calibre_link-2969} of the dangerous
supplement at the moment when it is a question of making visible a
distancing which is neither the same nor an other; Nature draws away at
the same time as the Mother, or rather []{#calibre_link-1066}"Mamma,"
who already signified the disappearance of the true mother and has
substituted herself in the well-known ambiguous manner. It is therefore
now a question of the distance between Mamma and
the[]{#calibre_link-2970} person she called "Little
one."^[]{#calibre_link-694}[5](#calibre_link-335){.nounder}^ As *Emile*
says, all evil comes from the fact that "women have ceased to be
mothers, they do not and will not return to their duty" (p. 18) \[p.
14\]. A certain absence, then, of a certain sort of mother. And the
experience of which we speak is such as to reduce that absence as much
as to maintain it. A *furtive* experience, that of a thief who needs
invisibility: that[]{#calibre_link-2971} the mother be invisible and not
see. These lines are often quoted:

I should never have done, if I were to enter into the details of all the
follies which the remembrance of this dear mamma caused me to commit
when I was no longer in her presence. How often have I kissed my bed,
since she had slept in it; my curtains, all the furniture of my room,
since they belonged to her, and her beautiful[]{#calibre_link-2972} hand
had touched them; even the floor, on which I prostrated myself, since
she had walked upon it! Sometimes, even in her presence, I was guilty of
extravagances, which only the most violent love seemed capable of
inspiring. At table one day, just when she had put a piece of food into
her mouth, I exclaimed that I saw a hair in it; she put back the morsel
on her plate, and I eagerly seized and swallowed[]{#calibre_link-2973}
it.^[]{#calibre_link-695}[6](#calibre_link-336){.nounder}^ In a word,
between myself and the most passionate lover there was only one, but
that an essential, point of distinction, which makes my condition almost
unintelligible and inconceivable ... \[A little above, we read\] I only
felt the full strength of my attachment when I no longer saw her (p.
107) \[pp. 110--11\]

#### ***The Chain of Supplements*** {#calibre_link-29 .h3}

The discovery of the dangerous supplement will be next
cited[]{#calibre_link-2974} *among* these "follies," but it will still
retain a privilege; Rousseau evokes it after the others and as a sort of
explanation of the state inconceivable to reason. For it is not the
question of diverting total enjoyment toward a particular substitute,
but now of experiencing it or miming it *directly and in its totality*.
It is no longer a question of kissing the bed, the floor, the curtains,
the[]{#calibre_link-2975} furniture, etc., not even of "swallowing" the
"piece ... \[that\] she had put into her mouth," but of "dispos\[ing\]
of the whole sex as ... \[one\] desire\[s\]."

I remarked that the stage of this theater was not only a setting in the
generally understood sense: an ensemble of accessories. The topographic
disposition of the experience is not unimportant. Jean-Jacques is in the
house of Madame de Warens;[]{#calibre_link-2976} close enough to *Mamma*
to see her and to nourish his imagination upon her but with the
possibility of a partition. It is at the moment when the mother
disappears that substitution becomes []{#calibre_link-1048}possible and
necessary. The play of maternal presence or absence, this alteration of
perception and imagination must correspond to an organization of space;
the text argues as follows:

Add to this habit the circumstances[]{#calibre_link-2977} of my
position, living as I was with a beautiful woman, caressing her image in
the bottom of my heart, seeing her continually throughout the day,
surrounded in the evening by objects which reminded me of her, sleeping
in the bed in which I knew she had slept! What causes for excitement!
Many a reader, who reflects upon them, no doubt already considers me as
half-dead! Quite the contrary;[]{#calibre_link-2978} that which ought to
have destroyed me was just the thing that saved me, at least for a time.
Intoxicated with the charm of living with her, with the ardent desire of
spending my life with her, I always saw in her, whether she were absent
or present, a tender mother, a beloved sister, a delightful friend, and
nothing more. ... She was for me the only woman in the world; and the
extreme sweetness[]{#calibre_link-2979} of the feelings with which she
inspired me did not allow my senses time to awake for others, and
protected me against her and all her sex.

This experience was not an event marking an archaic or adolescent
period. Not only did it construct or sustain a particular hidden
foundation, an edifice of significations. It remained an active
obsession whose "present" is constantly reactivated and
constituted[]{#calibre_link-2980} in its turn, until the end of
Jean-Jacques Rousseau's "life" and "text." A little later, a little
further on in the text of the *Confessions* (Book
IV),^[]{#calibre_link-696}[7](#calibre_link-337){.nounder}^ "a little
incident, which I find some difficulty in relating," \[p. 150\] is
related to us. The encounter with a man "addicted to the same vice."
Terrified, Jean-Jacques runs away, "trembling as if" he had just
"committed a crime." "The recollection[]{#calibre_link-2981} of this
incident cured me of it for a long time" \[p. 151\].

For a long time? Rousseau will never stop having recourse to, and
accusing himself of, this onanism that permits one to be himself
affected by providing himself with presences, by summoning absent
beauties. In his eyes it will remain the model of vice and perversion.
Affecting oneself by another presence, one *corrupts* oneself \[makes
oneself[]{#calibre_link-2982} other\] by oneself \[*on s'altère
soi-même\]*. Rousseau neither wishes to think nor can think that this
alteration does not simply happen to the self, that it is the self's
very origin. He must consider it a contingent evil coming from without
to affect the integrity of the subject. But he cannot give up what
immediately restores to him the other desired presence; no more than one
can give up language.[]{#calibre_link-2983} This is why, in this respect
as well, as he says in the *Dialogues \[Pléiade*, vol. 1\] (p. 800), "to
the end of his life he will remain an aged child."

The restitution of presence by language, restitution at the same time
symbolic and immediate. This contradiction must be thought. Immediate
experience of restitution because as experience, as consciousness or
conscience, []{#calibre_link-1049}*it dispenses with
passage[]{#calibre_link-2984} through the world*. What is touching is
touched, auto-affection gives itself as pure autarchy. If the presence
that it then gives itself is the substitutive symbol of another
presence, it has never been possible to desire that presence "in person"
before this play of substitution and this symbolic experience of
auto-affection. The thing itself does not appear outside of the symbolic
system that[]{#calibre_link-2985} does not exist without the possibility
of auto-affection. Experience of *immediate* restitution, also because
it *does not wait*. It is satisfied then and there and in the moment. If
it waits, it is not because the other makes it wait. Pleasure seems no
longer to be deferred. "Why give oneself so much trouble in a hope
remote from so poor and uncertain a success, when one can, from the very
instant[]{#calibre_link-2986} ..." (*Dialogues*).

But what is no longer deferred is also absolutely deferred. The presence
that is thus delivered to us in the present is a chimera. Auto-affection
is a pure speculation. The sign, the image, the representation, which
come to supplement the absent presence are the illusions that sidetrack
us. To culpability, to the anguish of death and castration, is added or
rather is assimilated[]{#calibre_link-2987} the experience of
frustration. *Donner le change* \["sidetracking" or, "giving money"\]:
in whatever sense it is understood, this expression describes the
recourse to the supplement admirably. In order to explain his "dislike"
for "common prostitutes," Rousseau tells us that in Venice, at
thirty-one, the "propensity which had modified all my passions"
(*Confessions*, p. 41) \[p.
35\]^[]{#calibre_link-698}[8](#calibre_link-338){.nounder}^ has not
disappeared:[]{#calibre_link-2988} "I had not lost the pernicious habit
of satisfying my wants *\[donner le change\]"* (p. 316) \[p. 289\].

The enjoyment of the *thing itself* is thus undermined, in its act and
in its essence, by frustration. One cannot therefore say that it has an
essence or an act (*eidos, ousia, energeia*, etc.). Something promises
itself as it escapes, gives itself as it moves away, and strictly
speaking it cannot even[]{#calibre_link-2989} be called presence. Such
is the constraint of the supplement, such, exceeding all the language of
metaphysics, is this structure "almost inconceivable to reason."
*Almost* inconceivable: simple irrationality, the opposite of reason,
are less irritating and waylaying for classical logic. The supplement is
maddening because it is neither presence nor absence and because it
consequently breaches both[]{#calibre_link-2990} our pleasure and our
virginity. "... abstinence and enjoyment, pleasure and wisdom, escaped
me in equal measure" (*Confessions*, p. 12).

Are things not complicated enough? The symbolic is the immediate,
presence is absence, the nondeferred is deferred, pleasure is the menace
of death. But one stroke must still be added to this system, to this
strange economy of the supplement. In a certain way,
it[]{#calibre_link-2991} was already legible. A terrifying menace, the
supplement is also the first and surest protection; against that very
menace. This is why it cannot be given up. And sexual auto-affection,
that is auto-affection in general, neither begins nor ends with
[]{#calibre_link-2992}what one thinks can be circumscribed by the name
of masturbation. The supplement has not only the power of *procuring* an
absent presence through its[]{#calibre_link-2993} image; procuring it
for us through the proxy *\[procuration\]* of the sign, it holds it at a
distance and masters it. For this presence is at the same time desired
and feared. The supplement transgresses and at the same time respects
the interdict. This is what also permits writing as the supplement of
speech; but already also the spoken word as writing in general. Its
economy exposes and protects[]{#calibre_link-2994} us at the same time
according to the play of forces and of the differences of forces. Thus,
the supplement is dangerous in that it threatens us with death, but
Rousseau thinks that it is not at all as dangerous as "cohabitation with
women." Pleasure *itself*, without symbol or suppletory, that which
would accord us (to) pure presence itself, if such a thing were
possible, would be only another name[]{#calibre_link-2995} for death.
Rousseau says it:

Enjoyment! Is such a thing made for man? Ah! If I had ever in my life
tasted the delights of love even once in their plenitude, I do not
imagine that my frail existence would have been sufficient for them, I
would have been dead in the act (*Confessions*, Book VIII).

If one abides by the universal evidence, by the necessary and a priori
value of this proposition in[]{#calibre_link-2996} the form of a sigh,
one must immediately recognize that "cohabitation with women,"
hetero-eroticism, can be lived (effectively, really, as one believes it
can be said) only through the ability to reserve within itself its own
supplementary protection. In other words, between auto-eroticism and
hetero-eroticism, there is not a frontier but an economic distribution.
It is within this general rule that[]{#calibre_link-2997} the
differences are mapped out. This is Rousseau's general rule. And before
trying---what I do not pretend to be doing here---to encompass the pure
singularity of Rousseau's economy or his writing, we must carefully
raise and articulate between them all the structural or essential
necessities on their different levels of generality.

It is from a certain determined representation of
"cohabitation[]{#calibre_link-2998} with women" that Rousseau had to
have recourse throughout his life to that type of dangerous supplement
that is called masturbation and that cannot be separated from his
activity as a writer. To the end. Thérèse---the Thérèse of whom we can
speak, Thérèse in the text, whose name and "life" belong to the writing
we read---experienced it at her cost. In Book XII of the *Confessions*,
at the moment when[]{#calibre_link-2999} "I must speak without reserve,"
the "two reasons combined" of certain "resolutions" is confided to us:

I must speak without reserve. I have never concealed either my poor
mamma's faults or my own. I must not show greater favor to Thérèse
either; and, pleased as I am to render honor to one who is so dear to
me, neither do I wish to conceal her faults, if so be that an
involuntary change in the[]{#calibre_link-3000} heart's affections is
[]{#calibre_link-1086}really a fault. I had long since observed that her
affection for me had cooled. ... I was conscious again of an
unpleasantness, the effects of which I had formerly felt when with
mamma; and the effect was the same with Thérèse. Let us not look for
perfections which are not to be found in nature; it would be the same
with any other woman whatsoever. ... My situation,
however,[]{#calibre_link-3001} was at that time the same, and even
aggravated by the animosity of my enemies, who only sought to find me at
fault. I was afraid of a repetition; and, not desiring to run the risk
of it, I preferred to condemn myself to strict continence, than to
expose Thérèse to the risk of finding herself in the same condition
again. Besides, I had observed that intercourse with women distinctly
aggravated my ill-health.[]{#calibre_link-3002} ... These two reasons
combined caused me to form resolutions which I had sometimes been very
inconsistent in keeping, but in which I had persevered with greater
firmness for the last three or four years (p. 595) \[pp. 616--17\].

In the *Manuscrit de Paris*, after "distinctly aggravated my
ill-health!" we read: "the corresponding vice, of which I have never
been able to cure myself completely, appeared[]{#calibre_link-3003} to
me to produce less injurious results. These two reasons combined
..."^[]{#calibre_link-699}[9](#calibre_link-339){.nounder}^

This perversion consists of preferring the sign and protects me from
mortal expenditure. To be sure. But this apparently egotistical economy
also functions within an entire system of moral representation. Egotism
is redeemed by a culpability, which determines auto-eroticism as a fatal
waste and a wounding of the self by the[]{#calibre_link-3004} self. But
as I thus harm only myself, this perversion is not truly condemnable.
Rousseau explains it in more than one letter. Thus: "With that exception
and \[the exception of\] vices that have always done harm to me alone, I
can expose to all eyes a life irreproachable in all the secrets of my
heart" (to M. de Saint-Germain, 2-26-70). "I have great vices, but they
have never harmed anyone but me"[]{#calibre_link-3005} (to M. Le Noir,
1-15-72).^[]{#calibre_link-700}[10](#calibre_link-340){.nounder}^

Jean-Jacques could thus look for a supplement to Thérèse only on one
condition: that the system of supplementarity in general be already open
in its possibility, that the play of substitutions be already operative
for a long time and that *in a certain way Thérèse herself be already a
supplement*. As Mamma was already the supplement of an unknown mother,
and as the "true[]{#calibre_link-3006} mother" herself, at whom the
known "psychoanalyses" of the case of Jean-Jacques Rousseau stop, was
also in a certain way a supplement, from the first trace, and even if
she had not "truly" died in giving birth. Here is the chain of
supplements. The name Mamma already designates one:

Ah, my Thérèse! I am only too happy to possess you, modest and healthy,
and not to find what I never looked for.[]{#calibre_link-3007} \[The
question is of "maidenhood" *\[pucelage\]* which Thérèse has just
confessed to have lost in innocence and by accident.\] At first I had
only sought amusement; I now saw that I had found more and gained a
companion. A little intimacy with this excellent girl, a little
[]{#calibre_link-3008}reflection upon my situation, made me feel that,
while thinking only of my pleasures, I had done much to promote my
happiness. *[]{#calibre_link-3009}To supply the place of* my
extinguished ambition, I needed a lively sentiment which should *take
complete possession of* \[literally "fill"---*remplit\]* my heart. In a
word, I needed a successor to mamma. As I should never live with her
again, I wanted someone to live with her pupil, in whom I might find the
simplicity and docility of heart which she had found in me. I felt it
neecssary that the gentle[]{#calibre_link-3010} tranquillity of private
and domestic life *should make up* to me for the loss of the brilliant
career which I was renouncing. When I was quite alone, I felt a void in
my heart, which it only needed another heart *to fill*. Destiny had
deprived me of, or, at least in part, alienated me from, that heart for
which Nature had formed me. From that moment I was alone; for *with me
it has always been everything[]{#calibre_link-3011} or nothing. I found
in Thérèse the substitute \[supplément\] that I
needed.^[]{#calibre_link-701}[11](#calibre_link-341){.nounder}^*

Through this sequence of supplements a necessity is announced: that of
an infinite chain, ineluctably multiplying the supplementary mediations
that produce the sense of the very thing they defer: the mirage of the
thing itself, of immediate presence, of originary perception. Immediacy
is derived. That all begins through[]{#calibre_link-3012} the
intermediary is what is indeed "inconceivable \[to reason\]."

#### ***The Exorbitant. Question of Method*** {#calibre_link-30 .h3}

"For me there has never been an intermediary between everything or
nothing." The intermediary is the mid-point and the mediation, the
middle term between total absence and the absolute plenitude of
presence. It is clear that mediacy is the name of all that Rousseau
wanted opinionatedly to efface.[]{#calibre_link-3013} This wish is
expressed in a deliberate, sharp, thematic way. It does not have to be
deciphered. Jean-Jacques recalls it here at the very moment when he is
spelling out the supplements that are linked together to replace a
mother or a Nature. And here the supplement occupies the middle point
between total absence and total presence. The play of substitution fills
and marks a determined lack. But[]{#calibre_link-3014} Rousseau argues
as if the recourse to the supplement---here to Thérèse---was going to
appease his impatience when confronted with the intermediary: "From that
moment I was alone; for me there has never been an intermediary between
everything and nothing. I found in Thérèse the substitute that I
needed." The virulence of this concept is thus appeased, as if one were
able to *arrest it*, domesticate it,[]{#calibre_link-3015} tame it.

This brings up the question of the usage of the word "supplement": of
Rousseau's situation within the language and the logic that assures to
this word or this concept sufficiently *surprising* resources so that
the presumed subject of the sentence might always say, through using the
"supplement," []{#calibre_link-3016}more, less, or something other than
what he *would mean \[voudrait dire\]*. This question is
therefore[]{#calibre_link-3017} not only of Rousseau's writing but also
of our reading. We should begin by taking rigorous account of this
*being held within \[prise\]* or this *surprise:* the writer writes *in*
a language and *in* a logic whose proper system, laws, and life his
discourse by definition cannot dominate absolutely. He uses them only by
letting himself, after a fashion and up to a point, be governed by the
system. And the[]{#calibre_link-3018} reading must always aim at a
certain relationship, unperceived by the writer, between what he
commands and what he does not command of the patterns of the language
that he uses. This relationship is not a certain quantitative
distribution of shadow and light, of weakness or of force, but a
signifying structure that critical reading should *produce*.

What does produce mean here? In my attempt to[]{#calibre_link-3019}
explain that, I would initiate a justification of my principles of
reading. A justification, as we shall see, entirely negative, outlining
by exclusion a space of reading that I shall not fill here: a task of
reading.

To produce this signifying structure obviously cannot consist of
reproducing, by the effaced and respectful doubling of commentary, the
conscious, voluntary, intentional relationship[]{#calibre_link-3020}
that the writer institutes in his exchanges with the history to which he
belongs thanks to the element of language. This moment of doubling
commentary should no doubt have its place in a critical reading. To
recognize and respect all its classical exigencies is not easy and
requires all the instruments of traditional criticism. Without this
recognition and this respect, critical production
would[]{#calibre_link-3021} risk developing in any direction at all and
authorize itself to say almost anything. But this indispensable
guardrail has always only *protected*, it has never *opened*, a reading.

Yet if reading must not be content with doubling the text, it cannot
legitimately transgress the text toward something other than it, toward
a referent (a reality that is metaphysical, historical,
psychobiographical, etc.)[]{#calibre_link-3022} or toward a signified
outside the text whose content could take place, could have taken place
outside of language, that is to say, in the sense that we give here to
that word, outside of writing in general. That is why the methodological
considerations that we risk applying here to an example are closely
dependent on general propositions that we have elaborated above; as
regards the absence of[]{#calibre_link-3023} the referent or the
transcendental signified. *There is nothing outside of the text* \[there
is no outside-text; *il n'y a pas de horstexte\]*. And that is neither
because Jean-Jacques' life, or the existence of Mamma or Thérèse
*themselves*, is not of prime interest to us, nor because we have access
to their so-called "real" existence only in the text and we have neither
any means of altering this, nor[]{#calibre_link-3024} any right to
neglect this limitation. All reasons of this type would already be
sufficient, to be sure, but there are more radical reasons. What we have
tried to show by' following []{#calibre_link-987}the guiding line of the
"dangerous supplement," is that in what one calls the real life of these
existences "of flesh and bone," beyond and behind what one believes can
be circumscribed as Rousseau's text, there has[]{#calibre_link-3025}
never been anything but writing; there have never been anything but
supplements, substitutive significations which could only come forth in
a chain of differential references, the "real" supervening, and being
added only while taking on meaning from a trace and from an invocation
of the supplement, etc. And thus to infinity, for we have read, *in the
text*, that the absolute present, Nature, that[]{#calibre_link-3026}
which words like "real mother" name, have always already escaped, have
never existed; that what opens meaning and language is writing as the
disappearance of natural presence.

Although it is not commentary, our reading must be intrinsic and remain
within the text. That is why, in spite of certain appearances, the
locating of the word *supplement* is here not at all psychoanalytical,
if by that[]{#calibre_link-3027} we understand an interpretation that
takes us outside of the writing toward a psychobiographical signified,
or even toward a general psychological structure that could rightly be
separated from the signifier. This method has occasionally been opposed
to the traditional doubling commentary; it could be shown that it
actually comes to terms with it quite easily. *The security with which
the commentary[]{#calibre_link-3028} considers the self-identity of the
text, the confidence with which it carves out its contour, goes hand in
hand with the tranquil assurance that leaps over the text toward its
presumed content, in the direction of the pure signified*. And in
effect, in Rousseau's case, psychoanalytical studies like those of Dr.
Laforgue transgress the text only after having read it according to the
most current[]{#calibre_link-3029} methods. The reading of the literary
"symptom" is most banal, most academic, most naive. And once one has
thus blinded oneself to the very tissue of the "symptom," to its proper
texture, one cheerfully exceeds it toward a psychobiographical signified
whose link with the literary signifier then becomes perfectly extrinsic
and contingent. One recognizes the other aspect of the same gesture
when, in[]{#calibre_link-3030} general works on Rousseau, in a package
of classical shape that gives itself out to be a synthesis that
faithfully restores, through commentary and compilation of themes, the
totality of the work and the thought, one encounters a chapter of
biographical and psychoanalytical cast on the "problem of sexuality in
Rousseau," with a reference in an Appendix to the author's medical
case-history.

If[]{#calibre_link-3031} it seems to us in principle impossible to
separate, through interpretation or commentary, the signified from the
signifier, and thus to destroy writing by the writing that is yet
reading, we nevertheless believe that this impossibility is historically
articulated. It does not limit attempts at deciphering in the same way,
to the same degree, and according to the same rules. Here we must take
into[]{#calibre_link-3032} account the history of the text in general.
When we speak of the writer and of the encompassing power of the
language []{#calibre_link-3033}to which he is subject, we are not only
thinking of the writer in literature. The philosopher, the chronicler,
the theoretician in general, and at the limit everyone writing, is thus
taken by surprise. But, in each case, the person writing is inscribed in
a determined textual system.[]{#calibre_link-3034} Even if there is
never a pure signified, there are different relationships as to that
which, from the signifier, *is presented* as the irreducible stratum of
the signified. For example, the philosophical text, although it is in
fact always written, includes, precisely as its philosophical
specificity, the project of effacing itself in the face of the signified
content which it transports and in[]{#calibre_link-3035} general
teaches. Reading should be aware of this project, even if, in the last
analysis, it intends to expose the project's failure. The entire history
of texts, and within it the history of literary forms in the West,
should be studied from this point of view. With the exception of a
thrust or a point of resistance which has only been very lately
recognized as such, literary writing has, almost
always[]{#calibre_link-3036} and almost everywhere, according to some
fashions and across very diverse ages, lent itself to this
*transcendent* reading, in that search for the signified which we here
put in question, not to annull it but to understand it within a system
to which such a reading is blind. Philosophical literature is only one
example within this history but it is among the most significant. And it
interests us[]{#calibre_link-3037} particularly in Rousseau's case. Who
at the same time and for profound reasons produced a philosophical
literature to which belong *The Social Contract* and *La nouvelle
Héloise*, and chose to live by literary writing; by a writing which
would not be exhausted by the message---philosophical or
otherwise---which it could, so to speak, deliver. And what Rousseau has
said, as philosopher or as psychologist,[]{#calibre_link-3038} of
writing in general, cannot be separated from the system of his own
writing. We should be aware of this.

This poses formidable problems. Problems of outlining in particular. Let
me give three examples.

1\. If the course I have followed in the reading of the "supplement" is
not merely psychoanalytical, it is undoubtedly because the habitual
psychoanalysis of literature begins by putting the[]{#calibre_link-3039}
literary signifier as such within parentheses. It is no doubt also
because psychoanalytic theory itself is for me a collection of texts
belonging to my history and my culture. To that extent, if it marks my
reading and the writing of my interpretation, it does not do so as a
principle or a truth that one could abstract from the textual system
that I inhabit in order to illuminate it with
complete[]{#calibre_link-3040} neutrality. In a certain way, I am
*within* the history of psychoanalysis as I am *within* Rousseau's text.
Just as Rousseau drew upon a language that was already there---and which
is found to be somewhat our own, thus assuring us a certain minimal
readability of French literature---in the same way we operate today
within a certain network of significations marked by psychoanalytic
[]{#calibre_link-643}theory, even if we[]{#calibre_link-3041} do not
master it and even if we are assured of never being able to master it
perfectly.

But it is for another reason that this is not even a somewhat
inarticulate psychoanalysis of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Such a
psychoanalysis is already obliged to have located all the structures of
appurtenance within Rousseau's text, all that is not unique to it---by
reason of the encompassing power and the
already-thereness[]{#calibre_link-3042} of the language or of the
culture---all that could be inhabited rather than produced by writing.
Around the irreducible point of originality of this writing an immense
series of structures, of historical totalities of all orders, are
organized, enveloped, and blended. Supposing that psychoanalysis can by
rights succeed in outlining them and their interpretations, supposing
that it takes[]{#calibre_link-3043} into account the entire history of
metaphysics---the history of that Western metaphysics that entertains
relationships of cohabitation with Rousseau's text, it would still be
necessary for this psychoanalysis to elucidate the law of its own
appurtenance to metaphysics and Western culture. Let us not pursue this
any further. We have already measured the difficulty of the task and the
element of frustration[]{#calibre_link-3044} in our interpretation of
the supplement. We are sure that something irreducibly Rousseauist is
captured there but we have carried off, at the same time, a yet quite
unformed mass of roots, soil, and sediments of all sorts.

2\. Even supposing that Rousseau's text can be rigorously isolated and
articulated within history in general, and then within the history of
the sign "supplement," one must[]{#calibre_link-3045} still take into
consideration many other possibilities. Following the appearances of the
word "supplement" and of the corresponding concept or concepts, we
traverse a certain path within Rousseau's text. To be sure, this
particular path will assure us the economy of a synopsis. But are other
paths not possible? And as long as the totality of paths is not
effectively exhausted, how shall we justify[]{#calibre_link-3046} this
one?

3\. In Rousseau's text, after having indicated---by anticipation and as
a prelude---the function of the sign "supplement," I now prepare myself
to give special privilege, in a manner that some might consider
exorbitant, to certain texts like the *Essay on the Origin of Languages*
and other fragments on the theory of language and writing. By what
right? And why these short texts, published[]{#calibre_link-3047} for
the most part after the author's death, difficult to classify, of
uncertain date and inspiration?

To all these questions and within the logic of their system, there is no
satisfying response. In a certain measure and in spite of the
theoretical precautions that I formulate, my choice is in fact
*exorbitant*.

*But what is the exorbitant?*

I wished to reach the point of a certain
exteriority[]{#calibre_link-3048} in relation to the totality of the age
of logocentrism. Starting from this point of exteriority,
[]{#calibre_link-3049}a certain deconstruction of that totality which is
also a traced path, of that orb (*orbis*) which is also orbitary
(*orbita*), might be broached. The first gesture of this departure and
this deconstruction, although subject to a certain historical necessity,
cannot be given methodological or logical
intraorbitary[]{#calibre_link-3050} assurances. Within the closure, one
can only judge its style in terms of the accepted oppositions. It may be
said that this style is empiricist and in a certain way that would be
correct. The *departure* is radically empiricist. It proceeds like a
wandering thought on the possibility of itinerary and of method. It is
affected by nonknowledge as by its future and it *ventures out*
deliberately. I have[]{#calibre_link-3051} myself defined the form and
the vulnerability of this empiricism. But here the very concept of
empiricism destroys itself. To *exceed* the metaphysical orb is an
attempt to get out of the orbit (*orbita*), to think the entirety of the
classical conceptual oppositions, particularly the one within which the
value of empiricism is held: the opposition of philosophy and
nonphilosophy, another name for[]{#calibre_link-3052} empiricism, for
this incapability to sustain on one's own and to the limit the coherence
of one's own discourse, for being produced as truth at the moment when
the value of truth is shattered, for escaping the internal
contradictions of skepticism, etc. *The thought of this historical
opposition between philosophy and empiricism is not simply empirical and
it cannot be thus qualified without abuse[]{#calibre_link-3053} and
misunderstanding*.

Let us make the diagram more specific. What is exorbitant in the reading
of Rousseau? No doubt Rousseau, as I have already suggested, has only a
very relative privilege in the history that interests us. If we merely
wished to situate him within this history, the attention that we accord
him would be clearly disproportionate. But that is not our intention. We
wish to identify[]{#calibre_link-3054} a decisive articulation of the
logocentric epoch. For purposes of this identification Rousseau seems to
us to be most revealing. That obviously supposes that we have already
prepared the exit, determined the repression of writing as the
fundamental operation of the epoch, read a certain number of texts but
not all of them, a certain number of Rousseau's texts but not all of
them. This avowal[]{#calibre_link-3055} of empiricism can sustain itself
only by the strength of the question. The opening of the question, the
departure from the closure of a self-evidence, the putting into doubt of
a system of oppositions, all these movements necessarily have the form
of empiricism and of errancy. At any rate, they cannot be described, *as
to past norms*, except in this form. No other trace is available, and as
these[]{#calibre_link-3056} errant questions are not absolute beginnings
in every way, they allow themselves to be effectively reached, on one
entire surface, by this description which is also a criticism. We must
begin *wherever we are* and the thought of the trace, which cannot not
take the scent into account, has already taught us that it was
impossible to justify a point of departure absolutely. *Wherever we
are:* in a text[]{#calibre_link-3057} where we already believe ourselves
to be.

[]{#calibre_link-3058}Let us narrow the arguments down further. In
certain respects, the theme of supplementarity is certainly no more than
one theme among others. It is in a chain, carried by it. Perhaps one
could substitute something else for it. *But it happens that this theme
describes the chain itself, the being-chain of a textual chain, the
structure of substitution,[]{#calibre_link-3059} the articulation of
desire and of language, the logic of all conceptual oppositions taken
over by Rousseau*, and particularly the role and the function, in his
system, of the concept of Nature. It tells us in a text what a text is,
it tells us in writing what writing it, in Rousseau's writing it tells
us Jean-Jacque's desire, etc. If we consider, according to the axial
proposition of this essay,[]{#calibre_link-3060} that there is nothing
outside the text, our ultimate justification would be the following: the
concept of the supplement and the theory of writing designate textuality
itself in Rousseau's text in an indefinitely multiplied structure---en
*abyme \[in an abyss\]*---to employ the current phrase. And we shall see
that this abyss is not a happy or unhappy accident. An entire theory of
the structural necessity[]{#calibre_link-3061} of the abyss will be
gradually constituted in our reading; the indefinite process of
supplementarity has always already *infiltrated* presence, always
already inscribed there the space of repetition and the splitting of the
self. Representation *in the abyss* of presence is not an accident of
presence; the desire of presence is, on the contrary, born from the
abyss (the indefinite multiplication)[]{#calibre_link-3062} of
representation, from the representation of representation, etc. The
supplement itself is quite exorbitant, in every sense of the word.

Thus Rousseau inscribes textuality in the text. But its operation is not
simple. It tricks with a gesture of effacement, and strategic relations
like the relationships of force among the two movements form a complex
design. This design seems to us to be represented[]{#calibre_link-3063}
in the handling of the concept of the supplement. Rousseau cannot
utilize it at the same time in all the virtualities of its meaning. The
way in which he determines the concept and, in so doing, lets himself be
determined by that very thing that he excludes from it, the direction in
which he bends it, here as addition, there as substitute, now as the
positivity and exteriority of evil, now[]{#calibre_link-3064} as a happy
auxiliary, all this conveys neither a passivity nor an activity, neither
an unconsciousness nor a lucidity on the part of the author. Reading
should not only abandon these categories---which are also, let us recall
in passing, the founding categories of metaphysics---but should produce
the law of this relationship to the concept of the supplement. It it
certainly a production, because I do[]{#calibre_link-3065} not simply
duplicate what Rousseau thought of this relationship. The concept of the
supplement is a sort of blind spot in Rousseau's text, the not-seen that
opens and limits visibility. But the production, if it attempts to make
the not-seen accessible to sight, does not leave the text. It has
moreover only believed it was doing so by illusion. It is contained in
the transformation of the language[]{#calibre_link-3066} it
[]{#calibre_link-3067}designates, in the regulated exchanges between
Rousseau and history. We know that these exchanges only take place by
way of the language and the text, in the infrastructural sense that we
now give to that word. And what we call production is necessarily a
text, the system of a writing and of a reading which we know is ordered
around its own blind spot. We know this a priori, but only now
and[]{#calibre_link-3068} with a knowledge that is not a knowledge at
all.

#### ***I. The Place of the "Essay"*** {#calibre_link-32 .h3}

What about the voice within the logic of the supplement? within that
which should perhaps be called the "graphic" of the supplement?

Within the chain of supplements, it was difficult to separate writing
from onanism. Those two supplements have in common at least the fact
that they are dangerous. They transgress[]{#calibre_link-3071} a
prohibition and are experienced within culpability. But, by the economy
of differance, they confirm the interdict they transgress, get around a
danger, and reserve an expenditure. In spite of them but also thanks to
them, we are authorized to see the sun, to deserve the light that keeps
us on the surface of the mine.

What culpability attaches to these two experiences? What fundamental
culpability[]{#calibre_link-3072} is found fixed or deflected there?
These questions may be elaborated in their proper place only if we first
describe the structural and "phenomenological" superficies of these two
experiences, especially the area they have in common.

In both cases, the possibility of auto-affection manifests itself as
such: it leaves a trace of itself in the world. The worldly residence of
a signifier becomes[]{#calibre_link-3073} impregnable. That which is
written remains, and the experience of touching-touched admits the world
as a third party. The exteriority of space is irreducible there. Within
the general structure of auto-affection, within the
giving-oneself-a-presence or a pleasure, the operation of
touching-touched receives the other within the narrow gulf that
separates doing from suffering. And the outside,
the[]{#calibre_link-3074} exposed surface of the body, signifies and
marks forever the division that shapes auto-affection.

Auto-affection is a universal structure of experience. All living things
are capable of auto-affection. And only a being capable of symbolizing,
that is to say of auto-affecting, may let itself be affected by the
other in general. Auto-affection is the condition of an experience in
general. This[]{#calibre_link-3075} possibility---another name for
"life"---is a general structure articulated by the history of life, and
leading to complex and hierarchical operations. Auto-affection,
[]{#calibre_link-3076}the as-for-itself or
for-itself---subjectivity---gains in power and in its mastery of the
other to the extent that its power of repetition *idealizes itself*.
Here idealization is the movement by which sensory exteriority, that
which affects[]{#calibre_link-3077} me or serves me as signifier,
submits itself to my power of repetition, to what thenceforward appears
to me as my spontaneity and escapes me less and less.

One must understand speech in terms of this diagram. Its system requires
that it be heard and understood immediately by whoever emits it. It
produces a signifier which seems not to fall into the world, outside the
ideality of the signified,[]{#calibre_link-3078} but to remain
sheltered---even at the moment that it attains the audiophonic system of
the other---within the pure interiority of auto-affection. It does not
fall into the exteriority of space, into what one calls the world, which
is nothing but the outside of speech. Within so-called "living" speech,
the spatial exteriority of the signifier seems absolutely
reduced.^[]{#calibre_link-702}[1](#calibre_link-343){.nounder}^ It is in
the context of this[]{#calibre_link-3079} possibility that one must pose
the problem of the cry---of that which one has always excluded, pushing
it into the area of animality or of madness, like the myth of the
inarticulate cry---and the problem of speech (voice) within the history
of life.

Conversation is, then, a communication between two absolute origins
that, if one may venture the formula, auto-affect reciprocally,
repeating as immediate[]{#calibre_link-3080} echo the auto-affection
produced by the other. Immediacy is here the myth of consciousness.
Speech and the consciousness of speech---that is to say consciousness
simply as self-presence---are the phenomenon of an auto-affection lived
as suppression of differance. That *phenomenon*, that presumed
suppression of differance, that lived reduction of the opacity of the
signifier, are the origin of what is[]{#calibre_link-3081} called
presence. That which is not subjected to the process of differance is
*present*. The present is that from which we believe we are able to
think time, effacing the inverse necessity: to think the present from
time as differance.

This very formal structure is implied by all analyses of the investments
of the system of orality and of the audiophonic system in general,
however rich and diverse[]{#calibre_link-3082} the field might be.

From the moment that nonpresence comes to be felt within speech
itself---and there is at least a foreboding of it from the very
threshold of articulation and diacriticity---writing is somehow fissured
in its value. On the one hand, as we have seen, it is the effort of
symbolically reappropriating presence. On the other, it consecrates the
dispossession that had already dislocated[]{#calibre_link-3083} the
spoken word. In both senses, one may say that in one way or another, it
had already begun to undermine and shape "living" speech, exposing it to
the death within the sign. But the supplementary sign does not expose to
death by affecting a self-presence that is already possible.
Auto-affection constitutes the same (*auto*) as it divides the same.
Privation of presence is the condition of
experience,[]{#calibre_link-3084} that is to say of presence.

[]{#calibre_link-928}In as much as it *puts into play* the presence of
the present and the life of the living, the movement of language does
not, one suspects, have only an analogical relationship with "sexual"
auto-affection. It is totally indistinguishable from it, even if that
totality is severely articulated and differentiated. The logocentric
longing par excellence is to distinguish[]{#calibre_link-3085} one from
the other. Its last resort would be to dissolve sexuality within the
transcendental generality of the structure "touching-touched," as a
certain phenomenology might describe it. That dissociation is the very
one by which one wishes to distinguish speech from writing. In the same
way that the "fatal advantage" of sexual auto-affection begins well
before what is thought to be circumscribed[]{#calibre_link-3086} by the
name of masturbation (organization of so-called wrong and pathological
gestures, confined to some children or adolescents), the supplementary
menace of writing is older than what some think to exalt by the name of
"speech."

From then on, metaphysics consists of excluding non-presence by
determining the supplement as *simple exteriority*, pure addition or
pure absence. The work of exclusion[]{#calibre_link-3087} operates
within the structure of supplementarity. The paradox is that one annuls
addition by considering it a pure addition. *What is added is nothing
because it is added to a full presence to which it is exterior*. Speech
comes to be added to intuitive presence (of the entity, of *essence*, of
the *eidos*, of *ousia*, and so forth); writing comes to be added to
living self-present speech; masturbation[]{#calibre_link-3088} comes to
be added to so-called normal sexual experience; culture to nature, evil
to innocence, history to origin, and so on.

The concept of origin or nature is nothing but the myth of addition, of
supplementarity annulled by being purely additive. It is the myth of the
effacement of the trace, that is to say of an originary differance that
is neither absence nor presence, neither negative
nor[]{#calibre_link-3089} positive. Originary differance is
supplementarity as *structure*. Here structure means the irreducible
complexity within which one can only shape or shift the play of presence
or absence: that within which metaphysics can be produced but which
metaphysics cannot think.

This movement of the effacement of the trace has been, from Plato to
Rousseau to Hegel, imposed upon writing in the narrow
sense;[]{#calibre_link-3090} the necessity of such a displacement may
now be apparent. Writing is one of the representatives of the trace in
general, it is not the trace itself. *The trace itself does not exist*.
(To exist is to be, to be an entity, a being-present, *to on*.) In a
way, this displacement leaves the place of the decision hidden, but it
also indicates it unmistakably.

[]{#calibre_link-33}***Writing, Political Evil, and Linguistic
Evil*.**[]{#calibre_link-3091} Desire desires the exteriority of
presence and nonpresence. This exterority is a matrix. Among all its
representations (exteriority of nature and its others, of good and of
evil, of []{#calibre_link-868}innocence and perversity, of consciousness
and nonconsciousness, of life and death, etc.), one in particular
requires our special notice. It will introduce us to *The Essay on the
Origin of Languages*. It is the exterioirty[]{#calibre_link-3092} of
mastery and servitude or of liberty and nonliberty. Among all these
representations, the exteriority of liberty and nonliberty is perhaps
privileged. More clearly than others, it brings together the historical
(political, economic, technological) and the metaphysical. Heidegger has
summarized the history of metaphysics by repeating that which made of
liberty the condition of presence, that[]{#calibre_link-3093} is to say,
of truth.^[]{#calibre_link-703}[2](#calibre_link-344){.nounder}^ And
speech always presents itself as the best expression of liberty. It is
by itself language at liberty and the liberty of language, the freedom
of a speech which need not borrow its signifiers from the exteriority of
the world, and which therefore seems incapable of being dispossessed. Do
the most imprisoned and deprived beings not make use of that interior
spontaneity[]{#calibre_link-3094} which is speech? What is true of the
citizen is in the first place true of those naked beings exposed to the
power of others: the newborn. "Your first gifts are fetters, your first
treatment, torture. *Their voice alone is free;* why should they not
raise it in complaint?" (*Emile*, p. 15 \[p. 11\]; italics added).

*The Essay on the Origin of Languages* opposes speech to writing as
presence to absence[]{#calibre_link-3095} and liberty to servitude.
These are almost the final words of the *Essay*. "But I say that any
tongue with which one cannot make oneself understood to the people
assembled is a slavish tongue. It is impossible for a people to remain
free and speak that tongue" (Chap. XX). With this sentence, through the
detour of the Lévi-Straussian ideology of the "neighborhood," of a
"small community where everybody[]{#calibre_link-3096} knew everybody
else" and where nobody went beyond earshot we have set foot again upon a
Rousseauist ground that we had hardly left: a classical ideology
according to which writing takes the status of a tragic fatality come to
prey upon natural innocence, interrupting the golden age of the present
and full speech.

Rousseau concludes thus:

These superficial reflections, which hopefully might
give[]{#calibre_link-3097} birth to more profound ones, I shall conclude
with the passage that suggested them to me: *"To observe in fact and to
show by examples, the degree to which the character, customs and
interests of a people influence their language, would provide material
for a sufficiently philosophical investigation." (Remarks on a General
and Reasoned Grammar*, by M. Duclos, p. 2 \[pp. 73--74\]).

In fact, the
*Commentary^[]{#calibre_link-704}[3](#calibre_link-345){.nounder}^*[]{#calibre_link-3098}
of Duclos, with the *Essai sur l'origine des connaissances
humaines[]{#calibre_link-1171}[\*](#calibre_link-346){.nounder}* of
Condillac (1746), seems to have been one of the
[]{#calibre_link-3099}major "sources" of *The Essay on the Origin of
Languages*. One might even be tempted to consider Rousseau's *Essay* as
the accomplishment of the "philsophic" program charted by Duclos. The
latter regrets

the penchant we have of making our language soft, effeminate and
monotonous.[]{#calibre_link-3100} We have reason to avoid roughness in
pronunciation, but I think we go too far into the opposite fault.
Formerly we pronounced many more diphthongs than we do today; in the
tenses, as J'avois \[jhavwa\], j'aurois \[jhorwa\], and in many nouns,
such as François \[Franswa\], Anglois \[Anglwa\], Polonois \[Polonwa\],
whereas today we say j'avais \[jhavay\], Fransay, Anglay, Polonay. Those
diphthongs, however, gave[]{#calibre_link-3101} force and variety to
pronunciation, and saved it from a monotony that partly arises from our
multitude of mute
e-s.^[]{#calibre_link-705}[4](#calibre_link-347){.nounder}^

The degradation of the language is the symptom of a social and political
degradation (a theme that will become most frequent in the second half
of the eighteenth century); it has its origins in the aristocracy and in
the capital city. Duclos announces the Rousseauist themes
most[]{#calibre_link-3102} precisely when he holds forth thus: "What we
call *society*, and what our ancestors would merely have called a
*coterie*, decides the nature of language and manners *\[moeurs\]*
today. When a word has been for a time in use *in these social circles*,
its pronunciation
softens."^[]{#calibre_link-706}[5](#calibre_link-348){.nounder}^ Duclos
finds equally intolerable similar multilations inflicted upon words,
their corruptions, and above all their
abridgements;[]{#calibre_link-3103} one must on no account *shorten
\[couper\]* words:

This nonchalance in pronunciation, which is not incompatible with an
impatience in expression, makes us corrupt even the nature of words, by
chopping them up in such a way that the meaning is no longer
recognizable. Today, for example, one pronounces the proverb as, in
spite of him and his teeth *\[ses dens\]*, rather than in spite of him
and his helpers[]{#calibre_link-3104} *\[ses aidans\]*. We have more of
these words shortened or corrupted by usage than one would credit. Our
language will become imperceptibly more proper for conversations than
for the tribune, and conversation sets the tone for the Chair, the Bar,
and for the Theater; whereas with the Greeks and Romans, the tribune did
not submit to it. A sustained pronunciation and a fixed and distinct
prosody must[]{#calibre_link-3105} be maintained in particular by
peoples who are obliged to treat publicly matters that are of interest
to all the auditors, for, other things being equal, an orator whose
pronunciation is firm and varied would be understood at a greater
distance than another ...

Deterioration in the language and in pronounciation is thus inseparable
from political corruption. The political model that inspires
Duclos[]{#calibre_link-3106} is Athenian or Roman democracy. The
language is the property of the people. Each derives its unity from the
other. For if language has a body and a system, they inhere in the
people assembled and "bodily" united: "It is a people in a body that
makes a language. ... A people is thus the absolute master of the
[]{#calibre_link-1056}*spoken* language, and it is an empire they
possess
unawares."^[]{#calibre_link-707}[6](#calibre_link-349){.nounder}^ To
dispossess the people of[]{#calibre_link-3107} their mastery of the
language and thus of their self-mastery, one must suspend the *spoken*
element in language. Writing is the very proceess of the dispersal of
peoples unified as bodies and the beginning of their enslavement: "The
body of a nation alone has authority over the *spoken language*, and the
writers have the right over the *written* language: *The people, Varro
said, are not masters of writing[]{#calibre_link-3108} as they are of
speech"* (p. 420).

This unity of political and linguistic evil calls for a "philosophical
examination." Rousseau already responds to this appeal by means of the
*Essay*. But we shall, very much later, recognize Duclos's problematics
in a much sharper form. The difficulty of the pedagogy of language and
of the teaching of foreign languages is, *Emile* will say, that one
cannot separate[]{#calibre_link-3109} the signifier from the signified,
and, changing words, one changes ideas in such a way that the teaching
of a language transmits at the same time an entire national culture over
which the pedagogue has no control, which resists him like the
already-there preceding the formation, the institution preceding
instruction.

You will be surprised to find that I reckon the study of languages among
the[]{#calibre_link-3110} useless lumber of education. ... If the study
of languages were merely the study of words, that is, of the symbols by
which language expresses itself, then this might be a suitable study for
children; but languages, as they change the symbols, also modify the
ideas which the symbols express. Minds are formed by language, thoughts
take their color from its ideas. Reason alone is common to all.
Every[]{#calibre_link-3111} language has its own form, a difference
which may be partly cause and partly effect of difference in national
character; this conjecture appears to be confirmed by the fact that in
every nation under the sun speech follows the changes of manners, and is
preserved or altered along with them (p. 105 \[P. 73\]).

And this entire theory of the teaching of languages rests on rigorous
distinctions separating[]{#calibre_link-3112} thing, meaning (or idea),
and sign; today we would speak of the referent, the signified, and the
signifier. If the representer may have an effect, sometimes pernicious,
on the represented, and if the child must not and cannot "learn to speak
more than one language," it is that "each thing may have a thousand
different signs for him; but each idea may have only one form" (ibid.)

Launched by Duclos,[]{#calibre_link-3113} the invitation to the
"philosophic examination" occupied Rousseau for a long time. In 1754 it
had been formulated in the *Commentary*. It is cited at the conclusion
of the *Essay;* elsewhere other passages of the *Commentary* are evoked,
notably in Chapter VII. Do these citations, which could not have been
anterior to the publication of the second *Discourse (Discourse on the
Origin and Foundations of[]{#calibre_link-3114} Inequality Among Men*),
also dated 1754, lead us to some certainty about the date
[]{#calibre_link-877}of the composition of the *Essay?* And to what
extent can one connect this chronological problem with the systematic
problem of what is called the author's thought? The importance that we
assign to this work compels us to consider the question.

On the date of the composition of this little known and posthumously
published[]{#calibre_link-3115} text, the most authoritative
interpreters and historians rarely agree. And when they do, it is
generally for different reasons. The ultimate question at stake within
this problem is evident: can one speak of this as a work of maturity?
does its content accord with the second *Discourse* and the later works?

In this debate, external arguments always mingle with internal ones. The
debate has continued[]{#calibre_link-3116} for more than seventy years
and has gone through two phases. If we begin by remembering the most
recent, it is primarily because it has developed a little as if the
first phase had not brought the external aspect of the problem to what I
would consider to be a definite conclusion. But it is also because, in a
certain way, it has renewed the form of the internal problem.

[]{#calibre_link-34}***The Present Debate: The[]{#calibre_link-3117}
Economy of Pity*.** The passages cited from Duclos are not the sole
indications that allow modern commentators to conclude that the *Essay*
comes after the second *Discourse* or that it is at the most its
contemporary. B. Gagnebin and M. Raymond recall in their edition of the
*Confessions^[]{#calibre_link-708}[7](#calibre_link-350){.nounder}^*
that "the *Essay on the Origin of Languages* appeared for the first time
in a volume of *Treatises on Music* by J.-J.[]{#calibre_link-3118}
Rousseau which De Peyrou published in Geneva in 1781, based on the
manuscript which he possessed and which he bequeathed to the Library of
Neuchâtel (No. 7835)." The editors of the *Confessions* draw attention
to "this most remarkable little work, too little read" and use the
citations from Duclos as evidence for placing it after the second
*Discourse*. "In short," they add, "the very material
of[]{#calibre_link-3119} the *Essay* presupposes a knowledge and a
maturity of thought that Rousseau had not acquired in 1750." This is
also the opinion of R.
Derathé,^[]{#calibre_link-709}[8](#calibre_link-351){.nounder}^ at least
on Chapter IX and X, which are among the most important and which,
explaining the "Formation of the Languages of the South" and the
"Formation of the Languages of the North," develop the themes most akin
to those of the second *Discourse*.

Is it[]{#calibre_link-3120} not plausible---and tempting to
imagine---that Rousseau might have spread out the composition of this
text over many years? Can one not isolate in it many strata of his
reflections? Could the passages from Duclos not have been introduced
later? Could certain of the important chapters not have been composed,
completed, or revised at the same time as the second *Discourse* or even
after? That would reconcile[]{#calibre_link-3121} the interpretations
and would give a certain authority to the hypothesis of those who now
place the conception, if not the entire execution, of the *Essay* well
before []{#calibre_link-875}1754. Thus Vaughan thinks, for external
reasons, that the *Essay* was planned before the second *Discourse*, and
even before the first *Discourse*
(1750).^[]{#calibre_link-710}[9](#calibre_link-352){.nounder}^ Indeed it
relates very closely to the writings on music. Its full title says
it[]{#calibre_link-3122} well: *Essay on the Origin of Languages, which
treats of Melody*, and *Musical Imitation*. It is known that the
writings on music follow from a very precocious inspiration. In 1742
Rousseau read at the Academy of Sciences his *Projet concernant les
nouveaux signes pour la musique*. In 1743 the *Dissertation sur la
musique moderne* appeared. In 1749, year of the composition of the first
*Discourse*, Rousseau[]{#calibre_link-3123} wrote, at D'Alembert's
behest, the articles on music for the *Encyclopaedia*. It is in the
context of these articles that he will write the *Dictionnaire de
musique[]{#calibre_link-1173}[\*](#calibre_link-353){.nounder}* to which
the *Essay* was joined at the time of its first publication. Can one not
imagine that the *Essay* was projected at this time, even if its
execution stretched out over many years, Rousseau modifying till 1754
certain intentions and[]{#calibre_link-3124} certain chapters until he
thought to make of the *Essay*, as he says in a
"Preface,"^[]{#calibre_link-711}[10](#calibre_link-354){.nounder}^ a
piece of the second *Discourse?*

However, in spite of the convenience and plausibility of this
reconciling conjecture, there is one point at which, for internal and
systematic reasons, it is difficult to get rid of the disagreement by
assigning a period and a part of the truth to each hypothesis. Here one
must[]{#calibre_link-3125} choose sides.

The moment comes with respect to the philosophical content of Chapter
IX, "Formation of the Southern Languages." It is over the subject of
this fundamental chapter that Derathé and Starobinski differ. To be
sure, they are never directly opposed on this point. But both give a
note^[]{#calibre_link-712}[11](#calibre_link-355){.nounder}^ to it, and
their confrontation may illuminate our problem.

That the essay was an intended part of[]{#calibre_link-3126} the second
*Discourse* is, according to Derathé, "the most plausible hypothesis, at
least with respect to Chapters IX and X ... which show the same
preoccupations as *The Discourse on Inequality."*

Now, it is precisely in Chapter IX that Starobinski locates an
affirmation which seems incompatible to him with the intention of the
second *Discourse*. From it he concludes that Rousseau's thought had
evolved.[]{#calibre_link-3127} And it could only have evolved from the
*Essay* to the *Discourse*, since the doctrine will seemingly no longer
vary on this point after 1754. Thus, systematically and historically,
the *Essay* is anterior to the second *Discourse*. And that would appear
from an examination of the status given by him to that fundamental
sentiment which according to him is *pity*. Briefly, the *Discourse*
makes of it a *natural*[]{#calibre_link-3128} feeling or virtue, coming
before the use of reflection, while in the *Essay*, Rousseau seems to
think that it is previously *aroused \[éveillée\]---let* us conserve all
the indeterminacy of the word for the moment---by judgment.

[]{#calibre_link-960}Since it gives rise to no disagreement, let us
first recall the doctrine of the *Discourse*. Rousseau affirms there
unambiguously that pity is more primitive than the work of
reason[]{#calibre_link-3129} and reflection. That is a condition of its
universality. And the argument could not help but aim at Hobbes:

I think I need not fear contradiction in holding man to be possessed of
the only *natural* virtue, which could not be denied him by the most
violent detractor of human
virtue.^[]{#calibre_link-713}[12](#calibre_link-356){.nounder}^ I am
speaking of compassion *\[pitié\]*, which is a disposition suitable to
creatures so weak and subject to so many[]{#calibre_link-3130} evils as
we certainly are: by so much the more universal and useful to mankind,
*as it comes before any kind of reflection;* and at the same time so
natural, that the very brutes themselves sometimes give evident proofs
of it.

And after giving examples of it within the human and the animal order,
but referring almost always to the mother-child relationship, Rousseau
continues:

Such is the pure[]{#calibre_link-3131} emotion of nature, *prior to all
kinds of reflection!* Such is the force of natural compassion *\[la
pitié naturelle\]*, which the greatest depravity of morals has as yet
hardly been able to destroy! ... Mandeville well knew that, in spite of
all their morality, men would have never been better than monsters, had
not nature bestowed on them a sense of compassion *\[pitié\]*, to aid
their reason. ... It is then[]{#calibre_link-3132} certain that
compassion *\[pitié\]* is a natural feeling, which, by moderating the
violence of love of self in each individual, contributes to the
preservation of the whole species. It is this compassion \[*pitié\]*
that hurries us *without reflection* to the relief of those who are in
distress: it is this which in a state of nature *supplies the place* of
laws, morals, and virtues, with the advantage that[]{#calibre_link-3133}
none are tempted to disobey its *gentle voice* \[pp.
183--84\].^[]{#calibre_link-714}[13](#calibre_link-357){.nounder}^

Let us pause before we take up the thread of the debate. Let us
reconsider the system of metaphors. Natural pity, which is illustrated
archetypically by the relationship between mother and child, and
generally by the relationship between life and death, commands like a
gentle voice. In the metaphor of that soft voice the presence
of[]{#calibre_link-3134} the mother as well as of Nature is at once
brought in. That the soft voice must be the mother's as well as Nature's
is clear from the fact that it is, as the metaphor of the voice clearly
always indicates in Rousseau, a law. "No one is tempted to disobey it"
at the same time because it is soft and because, being natural, and
absolutely original, it is also inexorable. That maternal law is a
voice.[]{#calibre_link-3135} Pity is a voice. As opposed to writing,
which is *without pity*, the voice is always, in its essence, the
passage of virtue and good passion. The order of pity "takes the place
of law," it supplements law, that is to say instituted law. But as
institutional law is also the supplement of natural law when the latter
is lacking, it is clear that only the concept of the supplement allows
us to think[]{#calibre_link-3136} the relationship between nature and
law here. These two terms have no meaning except within the structure of
supplementarity. The authority []{#calibre_link-1067}of nonmaternal law
has no sense except as it is substituted for the authority of natural
law, for the "gentle voice" which it was clearly necessary to be
"tempted to disobey." The order without pity to which one accedes when
the gentle voice stops making itself[]{#calibre_link-3137} heard, is it
quite simply, as we let it be imagined a moment ago, the order of
writing? Yes and no. Yes, to the extent that writing is read literally,
or is tied to the letter *\[on lit écriture à la lettre, ou on la lie à
la lettre\]*. No, as long as writing is understood in its metaphor. One
might then say that the natural law, the gentle voice of pity, is not
only uttered by a maternal solicitude,[]{#calibre_link-3138} it is
inscribed in our hearts by God. It concerns the natural writing, the
writing of the heart, which Rousseau opposes to the writing of reason.
Only the latter is without pity, it alone transgresses the interdict
that, under the name of natural affection, links the child to the mother
and protects life from death. To transgress the law and the voice of
pity is to replace natural affection by[]{#calibre_link-3139} perverse
passion. The first is good because it is inscribed in our hearts by God.
It is here that we encounter that divine or natural writing whose
metaphoric displacement we have already situated. In *Emile*, describing
what he calls the "second birth," Rousseau will write:

Our passions are the chief means of self-preservation; to try to destroy
them is therefore as absurd as it is useless; this[]{#calibre_link-3140}
would be to overcome nature, to reshape God's handiwork. If God bade man
annihilate the passions he has given him, He would and would not do so;
He would contradict himself. He has never given such a foolish
commandment, there is nothing like it written on the heart of man, and
what God will have a man do, He does not leave to the words of another
man, He speaks Himself; His words are written in[]{#calibre_link-3141}
the secret heart (pp. 246--47) \[p. 173\].

The absolutely primitive passion, which God may not ask us to deny
without contradicting Himself, is the love of self *\[l'amour de soi\]*.
It is wellknown that Rousseau distinguishes it from that self-love
*\[l'amour-propre\]* which is its corrupt form. Now, if the source of
all passions is natural, all the passions are not so. "A thousand
strange channels have[]{#calibre_link-3142} swollen it" (ibid.). What
concerns us here about the status of pity, the root of the love of
others, is that it is neither the source itself, nor a secondary stream
of passion, one acquired passion among others. It is *the first
diversion* of the love of self. It is *almost* primitive, and it is in
the difference between absolute proximity and absolute identity that all
the problematics of pity are[]{#calibre_link-3143} lodged. "The child's
first sentiment is love of self *\[l'amour de soi\];* and his second,
which is derived from it, is love of those about him" (p. 248) \[p.
174\]. That diversion/derivation is next demonstrated: it is less an
estrangement and an interruption of the love of self than its first and
most necessary consequence. If pity moderates "the violence *\[l'
activité\]* of love of self" (second *Discourse*[]{#calibre_link-3144},
p. 156) \[p. 184\], it is perhaps less by opposing itself to
it^[]{#calibre_link-715}[14](#calibre_link-358){.nounder}^ than
[]{#calibre_link-3145}by expressing it in an indirect way, by defering
it, since such moderation "contributes to the preservation of the whole
species" (ibid.).

It must further be understood how and why pity, itself supplanted by law
and society, may also play the role of that which supplants. Why at a
given time or all the time does it take the[]{#calibre_link-3146} place
of culture, being that which "in a state of nature supplies the place of
laws, morals, and virtues?" *\[Discourse*, p. 184\]. Against what
analogue of itself, against what depravity does it guard us, which
resembles and yet differs from it enough so that a substitution may take
place?

Is it by chance that, like many another supplement, the natural and
prereflexive sentiment of pity, which "contributes[]{#calibre_link-3147}
to the preservation of the whole species," protects us from, among other
deadly menaces, love? Is it by chance that pity protects man (*homo*)
from destruction through the fury of love, to the extent that it
protects man (*vir*) from his destruction through the fury of woman?
What God's inscription means is that pity---which ties the child to the
mother and life to nature---must protect us from the
amorous[]{#calibre_link-3148} passion which ties the child's
becoming-man (the "second birth") to the mother's becoming-woman. That
becoming is the great substitution. Pity protects the humanity of man,
and the life of the living, to the extent that it saves, as we shall go
on to see, the virility of man and the masculinity of the male.

In fact, if pity is natural, if that which brings us to identify with
others is an innate[]{#calibre_link-3149} movement, love or the amorous
passion is, on the contrary, not natural at all. It is a product of
history and society.

Of the passions that stir the heart of man, there is one which makes the
sexes necessary to each other, and is extremely ardent and impetuous; a
terrible passion that braves danger, surmounts all obstacles, and in its
transports seems calculated to bring destruction on the
human[]{#calibre_link-3150} race which it is really destined to
preserve. What must become of men who are left to this brutal and
boundless rage, without modesty, without shame, and daily upholding
their amours at the price of their blood? (*Discourse*, p. 157) \[p.
185\]

Under this bloody picture one must read, as in a palimpsest, *the other
scene:* that which, a moment ago and in the same colors, exhibited a
world of dead horses,[]{#calibre_link-3151} ferocious animals, and
children torn from the mother's breast.

The amorous passion is thus the perversion of natural pity. Unlike the
latter, it limits our attachment to a single person. As always in
Rousseau, evil here has the form of determination, of comparison and of
*preference*. That is to say of difference. This invention of culture
denatures pity, deflects its spontaneous movement,
which[]{#calibre_link-3152} would carry it instinctively and
indistinctly toward everything living, whatever may be its species and
sex. Jealousy, which marks the gap between pity and love, is not only a
creation []{#calibre_link-939}of culture in our society. As a ruse of
comparison, it is a stratagem of femininity, an arresting of nature by
woman. What is cultural and historical in love is at the service of
femininity: made to enslave man[]{#calibre_link-3153} to woman. It is "a
factitious sentiment; born of social usage, super-subtly celebrated by
women, with care for the establishment of their empire, and rendering
dominant the sex that ought to obey" (p. 158). *Emile* will say that
"the law of nature bids the woman obey the man" (p. 517) \[p. 370\]. And
Rousseau describes here the battle between man and woman according to
the pattern and in the very[]{#calibre_link-3154} terms of the Hegelian
dialectic of master and slave, which illuminates not only his text but
also *The Phenomenology of the Mind:*

If he takes a wife from a lower class, natural and civil law are in
accordance and all goes well. When he marries a woman of higher rank it
is just the opposite case; the man must choose between diminished rights
or imperfect gratitude; he must be ungrateful or
despised.[]{#calibre_link-3155} Then the wife, laying claim to
authority, makes herself a tyrant over her lawful head; and the master,
who has become a slave, is the most ridiculous and miserable of
creatures. Such are the unhappy favorites whom the sovereigns of Asia
honor and torment with their alliance; people tell us that if they
desire to sleep with their wife they must enter by the foot of the bed
(ibid.).

The historical[]{#calibre_link-3156}
perversion^[]{#calibre_link-716}[15](#calibre_link-359){.nounder}^ is
introduced through a double substitution: substitution of a political
command for domestic government, and of moral for physical love. It is
natural that the woman govern the home and Rousseau recognizes her
"natural talent" for it; but she must do it under the husband's
authority, "as a minister reigns in the State, by contriving to be
ordered to do what she wants":

I expect[]{#calibre_link-3157} that many of my readers will remember
that I think women have a natural gift for managing men, and will accuse
me of contradicting myself; yet they are mistaken. There is a vast
difference between claiming the right to command, and managing him who
commands. Women's reign is a reign of *gentleness*, tact, and kindness;
*her commands are caresses*, her threats are tears. She should reign in
the home[]{#calibre_link-3158} as a minister reigns in the state, by
contriving to be ordered to do what she wants. In this sense, I grant
you, that the best managed homes are those where the wife has most
power. But when she despises the *voice* of her head, when she desires
to usurp his rights and take the command upon herself, this inversion of
the proper order of things leads only to misery, scandal, and dishonor
(ibid.;[]{#calibre_link-3159} italics added).

In modern society, then, order has been reversed by woman and that is
the very form of usurpation. That substitution is not one abuse among
others. It is the paradigm of violence and political anomaly. Like the
[]{#calibre_link-1057}linguistic evil of which we spoke above---and we
shall soon see the two directly linked---that substitution is a
political evil. The *Letter to M. d'Alembert* says it well:

[]{#calibre_link-3160}... and, no longer wishing to tolerate separation,
unable to make themselves into men, the women make us into women. This
disadvantageous result which degrades man is very important everywhere;
but it is especially so in states like ours, whose interest it is to
prevent it. Whether a monarch governs men or women ought to be rather
indifferent to him, provided that he be obeyed; but in a republic,
men[]{#calibre_link-3161} are
needed.^[]{#calibre_link-717}[16](#calibre_link-360){.nounder}^

The morality of this proposition is that women themselves would gain if
the republic restored the natural order, for in a perverse society man
scorns the woman he must obey: "Cowardly devoted to the will of the sex
that we ought to protect rather than serve, we have learnt to scorn them
while we obey, to outrage them by our railing concern." And Paris,
guilty of the degradations[]{#calibre_link-3162} of language, is again
incriminated: "And each Parisian woman in her apartment assembles a
seraglio of men more feminine than herself, who know how to render all
kinds of homage to beauty, except for that of the heart which she
deserves" (ibid.).

The "natural" image of woman, as Rousseau reconstitutes it, emerges
slowly: exalted by man but submissive to him, she must govern without
being mistress.[]{#calibre_link-3163} One must *respect* her, that is to
say love her, from a sufficient distance so that the forces---our own
and those of the body politic---are not breached through it. For we risk
our *constitution* not only by "cohabiting with women" (instead of
containing them within domestic government) but also by regulating our
society according to theirs. "They \[men\] are affected as much as and
more than, women by[]{#calibre_link-3164} commerce that is too intimate:
they lose only their morals, but we lose our morals and our
constitution" (p. 204) \[p. 100\]. The contest is not equal; perhaps
that is the most profound signification of the play of supplementarity.

This takes us directly to the other form of substitutive perversion:
that which adds moral to physical love. There is a naturalness in love:
it serves procreation and[]{#calibre_link-3165} the conservation of the
species. That which Rousseau calls "the physicalness of Love" is, as its
name indicates, natural, and thus joined to the movement of pity. Desire
is not pity, to be sure, but, according to Rousseau, it is prereflexive
like pity. Now one must "distinguish ... between what is moral and what
is physical in the passion called love" (second *Discourse*, p. 157)
\[p. 196\]. Within[]{#calibre_link-3166} the "moral" that substitutes
itself for the natural, within the institution, history, and culture,
female perfidy, thanks to social usage, works to arrest natural desire
in order to capture its energy so that it may be directed to a single
person. It thus makes sure of an usurping of control:

[]{#calibre_link-3167}The physical part of love is that general desire
which urges the sexes to union with each other.
The[]{#calibre_link-3168} moral part is that which determines and fixes
this desire exclusively upon one particular object; or at least gives it
a greater degree of energy toward the object thus preferred.
(*Discourse*, pp. 157--58) \[p. 186\]

The operation of femininity---and that femininity, the feminine
principle, may be at work among women just as much as among those whom
society calls men and whom, Rousseau says, "women[]{#calibre_link-3169}
turn to women"---consists therefore in capturing energy to attach it to
a single theme, a sole representation.

Such is the history of love. In it is reflected nothing but history as
denaturalization: that which adds itself to nature, the moral
supplement, displaces the force of nature by substitution. In that sense
the supplement is nothing, it has no energy of its own, no spontaneous
movement.[]{#calibre_link-3170} It is a parasitic organism, an
imagination or representation which determines and orients the force of
desire. One can never explain, in terms of nature and natural force, the
fact that something like the difference of a *preference* might, without
any force of its own, force force. Such an inexplicability gives all its
style and all its form to Rousseau's thought.

This pattern is already an interpretation[]{#calibre_link-3171} of
history by Rousseau. But this interpretation lends itself in its turn to
a second interpretation where we notice a certain hesitation. Rousseau
seems to oscillate between two readings of this history. And the sense
of that oscillation should be recognized here. It will illuminate our
analysis yet further. Sometimes the perverse substitution is described
as the origin of history, as[]{#calibre_link-3172} historicity itself
and the first deviation with respect to natural desire. Sometimes it is
described as an historical depravity *within* history, not just a
corruption within the form of supplementarity but a supplementary
corruption. It is thus that one may read descriptions of an historical
society within which woman takes her place, remains in her place,
occupies her natural place, as an object[]{#calibre_link-3173} of
uncorrupted love:

The ancients spent almost their whole lives *in the open air*, either
dispatching their business or taking care of the state's in the public
place, or walking in the country, in gardens, on the seashore, in the
rain or under the sun, and almost always bareheaded. In all of this, no
women; but they were quite able to find them in case of need, and we do
not find from their writings[]{#calibre_link-3174} and the samples of
their conversation which are left to us that intelligence, taste, or
even love, lost anything by this reserve. (*Letter to M. d'Alembert*, p.
204 \[p. 101\]. Italics added.)

But is there a difference between corruption in the form of
supplementarity and supplementary corruption? Perhaps it is the concept
of supplementarity itself that allows us to think these two
interpretations[]{#calibre_link-3175} of
[]{#calibre_link-1068}interpretation at the same time. From the first
departure from nature, the play of history---as
supplementarity---carries within itself the principle of its own
degradation, of the supplementary degradation, of the degradation of
degradation. The acceleration, the precipitation of perversion within
history, is implied from the very start by the historical perversion
itself.

But the concept of[]{#calibre_link-3176} the supplement, considered, as
we have already done, as an *economic* concept, should allow us to say
the contrary at the same time without contradiction. The logic of the
supplement---which is not the logic of identity---allows the
acceleration of evil to find at once its historical compensation and its
historical guardrail. History precipitates history, society corrupts
society, but the evil that[]{#calibre_link-3177} links both in an
indefinite chain *\[qui les abîme\]* has its natural supplement as well:
history and society produce their own resistance to the abyss
*\[l'abîme\]*.

Thus, for example, the "moral part" of love is immoral: captor and
destroyer. But just as one may guard presence through defering it, just
as one may defer the expense, put off the mortal "cohabitation" with
woman by that other power of[]{#calibre_link-3178} death which is
auto-eroticism, so also, according to this economy of life or death,
society may place a moral guardrail over the abyss of "moral love." The
morality of society can in fact defer or weaken the capturing of energy
by imposing on woman the virtue of *modesty*. Within modesty, that
product of social refinement, it is in fact natural wisdom, the economy
of life, that controls culture[]{#calibre_link-3179} by culture.
(Rousseau's entire discourse, let us note in passing, finds here its
proper field of exercise.) As women betray the natural morality of
physical desire, society invents---but it is a ruse of nature---the
moral imperative of modesty which limits immorality; limits morality in
fact, for "moral love" was never immoral except as it menaced man's
life. The theme of modesty has a greater
importance[]{#calibre_link-3180} in *The Letter to M. d' Alembert* than
is generally thought. But it is central in *Emile*, especially in that
Fifth Book which one must follow here line by line. Modesty is clearly
defined there as a supplement of natural virtue. It has to do with
knowing if men wish to allow themselves to be "dragged to their death"
(p. 447 \[p. 322\]), by the number and intemperance of women. Their
"boundless desire"[]{#calibre_link-3181} does not in fact have that sort
of natural restraint that one encounters in female animals. With the
latter,

when the need is satisfied, the desire ceases; they no longer make a
feint of repulsing the male, they do it in earnest. They do exactly the
opposite of what Augustus' daughter did; they receive no more passengers
when the ship has its cargo. ... Instinct both drives and stops them.
*But[]{#calibre_link-3182} what would take the place of* \[supplement\]
*this negative instinct in women if you rob them of their modesty?* To
wait for them not to concern themselves with men, is to wait for them to
be good for nothing. (Italics added.) \[And this supplement is indeed
the []{#calibre_link-929}economy of men's
lives\]:[]{#calibre_link-1175}[\*](#calibre_link-361){.nounder} Their
natural intemperance would lead them to death; because it contains their
desires, modesty is the true morality[]{#calibre_link-3183} of women.

It is clearly confirmed that the concept of nature and the entire system
it commands may not be thought except under the irreducible category of
the supplement. Although modesty comes to fill the lack of a natural and
instinctive restraint, it is, nonetheless, as a supplement, and moral as
it certainly is, natural. This product of culture has a natural origin
and a natural end. God[]{#calibre_link-3184} Himself has inscribed it in
His creatures: "The Most High has deigned to do honor to mankind; he has
endowed man with boundless passions, together with a law to guide them,
so that man may be alike free and self-controlled; though swayed by
these passions man is endowed with reason by which to control them.
Woman is also endowed with boundless passions; God has given her modesty
to restrain them"[]{#calibre_link-3185} \[p. 323\]. Thus God gives
*reason* to supplement natural inclinations. Reason is thus at once
within nature and in a supplementary role to nature; it is a
supplementary ration. Which supposes that nature might sometimes lack
something within itself or, what is the same thing, might sometimes
exceed itself. And God even adds a bonus (*praemium*), a recompense, a
supplement to the supplement: "Moreover,"[]{#calibre_link-3186} Rousseau
continues, "he has given to both a present reward for the right use of
their powers, in the delight which springs from that right use of them,
i.e., the taste for right conduct established as the law of our
behavior. To my mind this is far higher than the instinct of the beasts"
\[p. 323\].

Guided by this pattern, one would have to reread all the texts
describing culture as the corruption[]{#calibre_link-3187} of nature: in
the sciences, the arts, spectacles, masques, literature, writing. One
would have to take them up again within the network of this structure of
"moral love," as the war of the sexes and as the chaining of the force
of desire by the feminine principle. Setting not only men against women
but also men against men, this war is historic. It is not a natural or
biological phenomenon. As[]{#calibre_link-3188} in Hegel, it is a war of
consciousness and desires, not of needs or natural desires. How does one
identify it? In particular by what cannot be explained by the scarcity
of females or by "the exclusive intervals, during which the females
constantly refuse the addresses of the male, which," Rousseau notes,

amounts to the first cause, for if each female admits the male but
during two months in the[]{#calibre_link-3189} year, it is the same as
if the number of females were five-sixths less. Now, neither of these
two cases is applicable to the human species, in which the number of
females usually exceeds that of males, and among whom it has never been
observed, even among savages, that the females have, like those of other
animals, their stated times of passion and
indifference.^[]{#calibre_link-718}[17](#calibre_link-362){.nounder}^

[]{#calibre_link-961}"Moral love," not having any[]{#calibre_link-3190}
biological foundation, is born of the power of the imagination. All the
depravity of culture, as the movement of difference and preference, is
therefore related to the possession of *women*. One must know who will
have the women but also what the women will have. And what price will be
paid within that calculation of forces. Now according to the principle
of acceleration or of capitalization that[]{#calibre_link-3191} we have
just defined, what opens evil is also that which precipitates toward the
worst. Rousseau might say like Montaigne "Our morals bend with a
marvelous inclination toward worsening" (*Essais*
II.82).[]{#calibre_link-1177}[\*](#calibre_link-363){.nounder} Thus
writing, here literary, conspires with moral love. The first appears at
the same time as the second. But moral love degrades even writing. It
enervates writing as it enervates man. It provokes

these throngs of ephemeral works which come to light every day, made
only to amuse women and having neither strength nor depth, \[and which\]
fly from the dressing table to the counter. This is the way to rewrite
ever again the same things and to make them always new. Two or three
will be cited which will serve as exceptions; but I will cite a hundred
thousand which will confirm the rule. It is[]{#calibre_link-3193} for
this reason that most of the productions of our age will pass with it,
and posterity will think that very few books were written in this age
which produced so
many.^[]{#calibre_link-719}[18](#calibre_link-364){.nounder}^

Has this detour taken us far from our initial preoccupation? How will it
help us to situate the *Essay* more precisely?

We have just verified that, comprehended by the entire system of
oppositions that it sustains, the concept[]{#calibre_link-3194} of
natural pity is fundamental. Yet, according to Starobinski, it is
absent, indeed excluded, from the *Essay on the Origin of Languages*.
And one cannot ignore this fact when assigning it a place within the
history and architechtonics of Rousseau's thought:

The importance of the spontaneous outburst of pity, the unreasoned
foundation of morality, has been indicated by Rousseau since the
Preface[]{#calibre_link-3195} to the *Discourse;* cf. p .126 and n. 1.
In this part of the *Discourse*, and later in *Emile*, Rousseau does not
cease affirming that pity is a virtue that "precedes the usage of all
reflexion." This is the definitive state of Rousseau's thought on this
subject. Now the *Essay on the Origin of Languages*, ch. IX, formulates
on this point many quite different ideas, which will perhaps allow us to
attribute[]{#calibre_link-3196} to this text (or at least to this
chapter) a date anterior to the final draft of the *Discourse on the
Origin of Inequality*. In the *Essay*, Rousseau does not admit the
possibility of an unpremeditated burst of sympathy, and seems more
inclined to sustain the Hobbesian idea of the war of all against all:
"They were not bound by any idea of common brotherhood and, having no
rule but that of force,[]{#calibre_link-3197} they believed themselves
each other's enemies. ... An individual isolated on the face of the
earth, at the mercy of mankind, is bound to be a ferocious
[]{#calibre_link-1101}animal. ... We develop social feeling only as we
become enlightened. Although pity is native to the human heart, it would
remain eternally quiescent unless it were activated by imagination. How
are we moved to pity? By getting outside ourselves
and[]{#calibre_link-3198} identifying with a being who suffers. We
suffer only as much as we believe him to suffer. ... He who has never
been reflective is incapable of being merciful or just or pitying. He is
just as incapable of being malicious and vindictive" \[pp. 31--32\].

This more intellectualist conception of pity agrees with the thought of
Wollaston.

Are these affirmations, extracted from the *Essay* and quoted
by[]{#calibre_link-3199} Starobinski, incompatible with the theses of
the *Discourse* and *Emile?* It seems not. At least for three sorts of
reasons:

A. First, Rousseau makes a concession in the *Essay* which assures its
place within the entire theory---supposedly "later"---of pity. He
writes: "Although pity is native to the human heart ..." He thus
recognizes that pity is an innate, spontaneous, and prereflexive virtue.
That will[]{#calibre_link-3200} be the thesis of the *Discourse* and of
*Emile*.

B. It is "imagination," not "reason," without which this pity "natural
to man's heart" would remain unawakened and "inactive." According to the
second *Discourse*, natural pity is in danger of being strangled or
corrupted by reason and reflection. Reflective reason is not
contemporaneous with pity. The *Essay* does not say the contrary. Pity
does not awaken[]{#calibre_link-3201} with reason but with imagination
which wrenches it from its slumbering inactuality. Not only does
Rousseau take for granted the distinction between imagination and
reason, but he makes this difference the strength of his entire thought.

Certainly imagination here has a value whose ambiguity is often
recognized. If it is able to corrupt us, it is first because it opens
the possibility of progress.[]{#calibre_link-3202} It *broaches*
history. Without it perfectibility, which, as one knows, constitutes the
absolute distinguishing trait of humanity for Rousseau, would be
impossible. Although the concept of reason is very complex in
Rousseau,^[]{#calibre_link-720}[19](#calibre_link-365){.nounder}^ it may
be said that, in certain regards, reason, in as much as it is the
understanding and the faculty of forming ideas, is less proper to
humanity than imagination and perfectibility.[]{#calibre_link-3203} We
have already noticed in what sense reason may be called natural. One may
also remark that from another point of view animals, although they are
gifted with intelligence, are not perfectible. They are deprived of the
imagination, of that power of anticipation that exceeds the givens of
the senses and takes us toward the unperceived:

Every animal has ideas, since it has senses; it even
combines[]{#calibre_link-3204} those ideas in a certain degree; and it
is only in degree that man differs, in this respect, from the brute.
Some philosophers have even maintained that there is a greater
difference between one man and another than between some men and
[]{#calibre_link-645}some beasts. It is not, therefore, so much the
understanding that constitutes the specific difference between the man
and the brute, as the human quality of free[]{#calibre_link-3205}
agency. (Second *Discourse*, p. 141 \[p. 170\])

Liberty is therefore perfectibility. "There is another very specific
quality which distinguishes them \[man and animal\], and which will
admit of no dispute. This is the faculty of self-improvement *\[se
perfectionner\]* (p. 142) \[p. 171\].

The imagination is at the same time the condition of
perfectibility---liberty---and that without which pity would
neither[]{#calibre_link-3206} awaken nor exercise itself within the
human order. It activates and excites a potential power.

1\. Imagination inaugurates liberty and perfectibility because
sensibility, as well as intellectual reason, filled and satiated by the
presence of the perceived, is exhausted by a fixist concept. Animality
has no history because feeling and understanding are, at root, functions
of passivity. "As reason[]{#calibre_link-3207} has little force,
interest alone does not have as much force as one believes. Only
imagination is active and one excites the passions only by imagination"
(*Letter to the Prince of Würtemberg*.
11.10.63).[]{#calibre_link-1179}[\*](#calibre_link-366){.nounder}
Immediate consequence: reason, a function of interest and need, the
technical and calculating faculty, is not the origin of language, which
is also a human property and without which there
would[]{#calibre_link-3208} be no perfectibility. Language is born of
the imagination which arouses or at any rate excites sentiment or
passion. This affirmation, which will be repeated ceaselessly, is
already there at the opening of the *Essay*: "Speech distinguishes man
among animals." The first words of Chapter II: "It seems then that need
dictated the first gestures, while the passions wrung forth the first
words" \[p.[]{#calibre_link-3209} 11\].

We thus see two series working themselves out: (1) animality, need,
interest, gesture, sensibility, understanding, reason, etc. (2)
humanity, passion, imagination, speech, liberty, perfectibility, etc.

It will gradually appear that, under the complexity of strands tangled
in Rousseau's texts among these terms, requiring the minutest and most
careful analyses, these two series always relate[]{#calibre_link-3210}
to each other according to the structure of supplementarity. All the
names of the second series are metaphysical determinations---and
therefore inherited, arranged with a laborious and interrelating
coherence---of *supplementary differance*.

A dangerous differance, of course. For we have omitted the master-name
of the supplementary series: death. Or rather, for death is nothing, the
relationship to[]{#calibre_link-3211} death, the anguished anticipation
of death. All the possibilities of the supplementary series, which have
the relationships of metonymic substitutions among themselves,
indirectly name the danger itself, the horizon and source of all
determined dangers, the abyss from which all menaces announce
themselves. We should not be surprised when, in the second *Discourse*,
[]{#calibre_link-1069}the notion of perfectibility
or[]{#calibre_link-3212} liberty is set forth at the same time as the
knowledge of death. The property of man is announced from the double
possibility of liberty and of the express anticipation of death. The
difference between human desire and animal need, between relationship
with the woman and relationship with the female, is the fear of death:

The only goods he \[the animal\] recognizes in the universe are food, a
female,[]{#calibre_link-3213} and sleep: the only evils he fears are
pain and hunger. I say pain, and not death: for no animal can know what
it is to die; the knowledge of death and its terror being one of the
first acquisitions made by man in departing from an animal state.
(Second *Discourse*, p. 143 \[p. 171\]) So does the *child* become man
when he opens himself to "the consciousness of death." (*Emile*, p. 20)
\[p. 15\]

If one[]{#calibre_link-3214} moves along the course of the supplementary
series, he sees that imagination belongs to the same chain of
significations as the anticipation of death. Imagination is at bottom
the relationship with death. The image is death. A proposition that one
may define or make indefinite thus: *the* image is *a* death or (*the*)
death is *an* image. Imagination is the power that allows life to affect
itself with[]{#calibre_link-3215} its own re-presentation. The image
cannot represent and add the representer to the represented, except in
so far as the presence of the re-presented is already folded back upon
itself in the world, in so far as life refers to itself as to its own
lack, to its own wish for a supplement. The presence of the represented
is constituted with the help of the addition to itself of that nothing
which is[]{#calibre_link-3216} the image, announcement of its
dispossession within its own representer and within its death. The
property *\[le propre\]* of the subject is merely the movement of that
representative expropriation. In that sense imagnation, like death, is
*representative and supplementary*. Let us not forget that these are the
qualities Rousseau expressly recognizes in writing.

Imagination, liberty, and speech belong[]{#calibre_link-3217} then to
the same structure as the relationship with death (let us rather say
relationship than anticipation; to suppose that there is a
being-faced-with death is not necessarily to suppose that there is a
relationship established with a more or less distanced point on a
horizon of time. It is a structure of presence). How do pity and the
identification with others' suffering intervene there?

[]{#calibre_link-3218}2. I have said that the imagination is the only
thing which can excite natural pity. Rousseau says this clearly in the
*Essay*, but, contrary to what Starobinski's most careful formulation
would seem to imply, he also invariably says it elsewhere. For him, pity
never stops being a natural sentiment or an inner virtue that only
imagination has the power to awaken or reveal. Let us note in
passing[]{#calibre_link-3219} that Rousseau's entire theory of the
theatre also establishes a connection, within representation, between
the power of identification---pity---and the faculty of the imagination.
If now it is remembered that Rousseau gives the name terror to the fear
of death (*Discourse*, []{#calibre_link-1050}p. 143) \[p. 171\], one
perceives together the entire system which organizes the concepts of
terror and pity on the one hand, and[]{#calibre_link-3220} of the tragic
scene, representation, the imagination, and death on the other. This
example makes the ambivalence of the power of imagining understandable:
it surmounts animality and arouses human passion only by opening the
scene and the space of theatrical representation. It inaugurates the
perversion whose possibility is itself inscribed in the notion of
perfectibility.

The scheme upon which[]{#calibre_link-3221} Rousseau's thought has never
varied would therefore be the following: pity is innate, but in its
natural purity it is not the property of man in particular, it belongs
to all living beings in general. It is "so natural, that the very brutes
themselves sometimes give evident proofs of it" \[p. 182\]. Without
imagination, this pity does not awaken of itself in humanity, is not
accessible to passion,[]{#calibre_link-3222} language, and
representation, does not produce identification with the other as with
another me. Imagination is the becoming-human of pity.

That is indeed the thesis of the *Essay:* "Although pity is native to
the human heart, it would remain eternally quiescent unless it were
activated by imagination" \[p. 32\]. This appeal to activation and to
actualization by the imagination is so little in
contradiction[]{#calibre_link-3223} with other texts that one can follow
everywhere in Rousseau's work a theory of *innateness* as *virtuality*
or of naturality as sleeping
potentiality.^[]{#calibre_link-721}[20](#calibre_link-367){.nounder}^
Not a very original theory to be sure, but one whose organizing role is
indispensable. It asks us to think of nature not as a given, as a real
presence, but as a *reserve*. This concept is itself confusing: one may
determine it as a hidden actuality,[]{#calibre_link-3224} dissimulated
deposit, but also as a reserve of indeterminate power. Such that the
imagination, which makes the power of that reserve come forth, is at
once beneficent and maleficent. "In fact such is the empire of the
imagination among us and such is its influence, that from it are born
not only the virtues and the vices, but also good and evil" (*Dialogues,
Pléiade* I, pp. 815--16). And if "certain[]{#calibre_link-3225} people
pervert the usage of this consoling faculty" (ibid.), it is once more by
the power of the imagination. Escaping all real and exterior influence,
the imagination, faculty of signs and appearances, perverts itself. It
is the subject of perversion. It awakens the potential faculty but just
as quickly transgresses it. It brings forth the power which was held
back but, by showing that power[]{#calibre_link-3226} what lies beyond
it, by "superseding" it, imagination signifies for it its powerlessness.
It animates the faculty of enjoyment but inscribes a difference between
desire and power. If we desire beyond our power of satisfaction, the
origin of that surplus and of that difference is named imagination. This
permits us to determine a function of the concept of nature or of
primitiveness: it is the equilibrium[]{#calibre_link-3227} between
reserve and desire. An impossible equilibrium, for desire cannot awaken
and move out of its reserve except by the imagination, which also breaks
the equilibrium. This impossible thing---another name for
nature---therefore []{#calibre_link-1070}remains a limit. According to
Rousseau, ethics, "human wisdom," "the path of true happiness,"
consists, then, in staying as close as possible to that limit, and in
"decreasing[]{#calibre_link-3228} the difference between our desires and
our powers *\[l'excès des désirs sur les facultés\]."*

In this condition, nature, who does everything for the best, has placed
him from the first. To begin with, she gives him only such desires as
are necessary for self-preservation and such powers as are sufficient
for their satisfaction. All the rest she has stored in his mind as a
sort of reserve, to be drawn[]{#calibre_link-3229} upon at need. It is
only in this primitive condition that we find the equilibrium between
desire and power, and then alone man is not unhappy. As *soon as his
potential powers of mind begin to function, imagination, more powerful
than all the rest, awakes, and precedes all the rest*. It is imagination
which enlarges the bounds of possibility for us, whether for good or
ill, and therefore stimulates[]{#calibre_link-3230} and feeds desires by
the hope of satisfying them. But the object which seemed within our
grasp flies quicker than we can follow. ... Thus we exhaust our
strength, yet never reach our goal, and the nearer we are to pleasure,
the further we are from happiness. On the other hand, the more nearly a
man's condition approximates to this state of nature *the more the
difference between his desires and his[]{#calibre_link-3231} powers is
small*, and he is therefore less remote from happiness. ... The world of
reality has its bounds, the world of imagination is boundless; as we
cannot enlarge the one, let us restrict the other; for all the
sufferings which really make us miserable arise from the difference
between the real and the imaginary. (*Emile*, p. 64 \[pp. 44--45\].
Italics added.)

Thus we note:

1\. that imagination,[]{#calibre_link-3232} origin of the difference
between power and desire, is determined as *differance:* of or within
presence or pleasure *\[jouissance\];*

2\. that the relationship to nature is defined in terms of negative
distance. It is not a question of departing from nature, or of rejoining
it, but of reducing its "distance."

3\. that imagination, which excites other virtual faculties, is none the
less itself a virtual[]{#calibre_link-3233} faculty: "the most active of
all." So much so that the power of transgressing nature is itself within
nature. It belongs to nature's resources. Better: we shall see that the
power of transgression holds the reserve in reserve. This
being-in-nature has thus the strange mode of being of the supplement.
Designating at once the excess and lack of nature *within* nature. Here
we shall locate the unsteadying[]{#calibre_link-3234} of a classical
logic through the signification of *being-within*, as through one
example among others.

In as much as it is "the most active of all" the faculties, imagination
cannot be awakened by any faculty. When Rousseau says it "awakens
itself," he means it in a very strictly reflexive sense. Imagination
alone has the power of *giving birth to itself*. It creates nothing
because it is imagination.[]{#calibre_link-3235} But it receives nothing
that is alien or anterior to it. It is not affected by
[]{#calibre_link-962}the "real." It is pure auto-affection. It is the
other name of differance as
auto-affection.^[]{#calibre_link-722}[21](#calibre_link-368){.nounder}^

Rousseau delineates man out of this possibility. Imagination inscribes
the animal within human society. It makes the animal accessible to
humankind. The paragraph of the *Essay* which we are considering ends
thus: "He who imagines[]{#calibre_link-3236} nothing senses no-one but
himself; he is alone in the midst of humankind." This solitude or this
nonbelonging to humankind is due to the fact that suffering remains mute
and closed in upon itself. Which signifies on the one hand that it
cannot open itself, by the awakening of pity, to the suffering of the
other as other; and on the other hand that it cannot exceed itself
toward death. Indeed,[]{#calibre_link-3237} the animal does have a
potential faculty of pity, but it imagines neither the suffering of the
other *as such* nor the passage from suffering *to death*. Indeed, that
is one and the same limit. The relation with the other and the relation
with death are one and the same opening. That which is lacking in what
Rousseau calls the animal is the ability to live its suffering as the
suffering of another[]{#calibre_link-3238} and as the threat of death.

Thought within its concealed relation to the logic of the supplement,
the concept of virtuality or potentiality (like the entire problematic
of power and the act) undoubtedly has for its function, for Rousseau in
particular and within metaphysics in general, the systematic
predetermining of becoming as production and development, evolution or
history, through the substitution[]{#calibre_link-3239} of the
accomplishment of a *dynamis* for the substitution of a trace, of pure
history for pure play, and, as I noted above, of a welding together for
a break. The movement of supplementarity seems to escape this
alternative and to permit us to think it.

C. Rousseau thus comes to evoke the awakening of pity by the
imagination---that is to say by representation and reflection---in the
double but actually[]{#calibre_link-3240} in the single sense of those
words. In the same chapter, he forbids us to think that before the
actualization of pity through imagination, man is wicked and bellicose.
Let us recall Starobinski's interpretation: "In the *Essay*, Rousseau
does not admit the possibility of an unpremeditated burst of sympathy,
and seems more inclined to sustain the Hobbesian idea of the war of all
against all":

They[]{#calibre_link-3241} were not bound by an idea of common
brotherhood and, having no rule but that of force, they believed
themselves each other's enemies. ... An individual isolated on the face
of the earth, at the mercy of mankind, is bound to be a ferocious
animal. \[*Essay*, pp. 31--32\]

Rousseau does not say "they were each other's enemies" but "they
believed themselves each other's enemies." It seems to be that
we[]{#calibre_link-3242} have the right to, and indeed should, consider
that nuance. Primitive hostility []{#calibre_link-963}comes out of a
primitive illusion. This first *opinion* is due to a misguided belief,
born of isolation, feebleness, dereliction. That it is only a simple
opinion and already an illusion appears clearly in these three sentences
that must not be overlooked:

... they believed themselves each other's enemies. *This
belief[]{#calibre_link-3243} was due to their weakness and ignorance.
Knowing nothing, they feared everything. They attacked in self-defense*.
An individual isolated on the face of the earth ... \[*Essay*, p. 32.
Italics added.\]

Ferocity is thus not bellicose but fearful. Above all, it is incapable
of declaring war. It is the animal's characteristic ("ferocious
animal"), the characteristic of the isolated being who, not
having[]{#calibre_link-3244} been awakened to pity by the imagination,
does not yet participate in sociality or in humankind. That animal, let
us emphasize, "would be *ready* to do unto others all the evil that he
*feared* from them. *Fear and weakness are the sources of cruelty"*
\[*Essay*, p. 32. Italics added\]. Cruelty is not positive wickedness.
The disposition to do evil finds its resource only in the other, in the
illusory representation[]{#calibre_link-3245} of evil that the other
*seems* disposed to do to me.

Is this not already sufficient reason for setting aside the resemblance
with the Hobbesian theory of a natural war that imagination and reason
would merely organize into a sort of economy of aggressivity? But
Rousseau's text is even clearer. In the *Essay*, the paragraph that
occupies us comprises another proposition which forbids us to
consider[]{#calibre_link-3246} the moment of slumbering pity as the
moment of bellicose wickedness, as a "Hobbesian" moment. How in fact
does Rousseau describe that moment (here at least it does not matter if
it is real or mythic), the structural instance of slumbering pity? What,
according to him, is that moment when language, imagination, relation to
death, etc., are still *reserved?*

At that moment, he says, "he who has never[]{#calibre_link-3247} been
reflective is incapable of being merciful or just or pitying" \[p. 32\].
To be sure. But that is not to say that he would be unjust and pitiless.
He is simply held short of that opposition of values. For Rousseau
follows up immediately: "He is just as incapable of being malicious and
vindictive. He who imagines nothing is aware only of himself; he is
isolated in the midst of mankind" (ibid.).

[]{#calibre_link-3248}
:::

In that "state," the oppositions available in Hobbes have neither sense
nor value. The system of appreciation within which political philosophy
moves, has as yet no chance to function. And one thus sees more clearly
within what (neutral, naked, and bare) element that system enters into
play. Here one may speak with indifference of goodness or badness, of
peace or war: each time it will be as true[]{#calibre_link-3249} as
false, always irrelevant. What Rousseau thus reveals is the neutral
origin of all ethico-political conceptuality, its field of objectivity,
and its axiological system. All the oppositions that follow in the wake
of the classical philosophy of history, culture, and society
[]{#calibre_link-3250}must therefore be neutralized. Before this
neutraliaztion, or this reduction, political philosophy proceeds within
the naiveté[]{#calibre_link-3251} of acquired and accidental evidence.
And it incessantly risks "the blunder made by those who, in reasoning on
the state of nature, always import into it ideas gathered in a state of
society" (Second *Discourse*, p. 146) \[p. 174\].

The reduction that the *Essay* operates has a particular style. Rousseau
neutralizes oppositions by erasing them; and he erases them by affirming
contradictory values at[]{#calibre_link-3252} the same time. The
procedure is used with coherence and firmness, precisely in Chapter 9:

This accounts for the apparent contradictions seen in the fathers of
nations: so natural, and so inhuman; such ferocious behavior and such
tender hearts. ... These barbaric times were a golden age, not because
men were united, but because they were separated. ... If you wish, men
would attack each other when[]{#calibre_link-3253} they met, but they
rarely met. A state of war prevailed universally, and the entire earth
was at peace \[p.
33\].^[]{#calibre_link-723}[22](#calibre_link-369){.nounder}^

To privilege one of the two terms, to believe that only a state of war
actually existed, was the Hobbesian error that strangely "redoubles" the
illusory "opinion" of the first "men" who "believed they were enemies of
each other." Again no difference between *Essay* and *Discourse*.
The[]{#calibre_link-3254} reduction operating within the *Essay* will be
confirmed in the *Discourse*, precisely in the course of a critique of
Hobbes. What is reproached in Hobbes is precisely that he concludes too
quickly that men were neither naturally awakened to pity, nor "bound by
any idea of common fraternity," that they were therefore wicked and
bellicose. We cannot read the *Essay* as Hobbes might have hastily
interpreted[]{#calibre_link-3255} it. We cannot conclude wickedness from
nongoodness. The *Essay* says it and the *Discourse* confirms it, if we
assume that the latter comes after the former:

Above all, let us not conclude, with Hobbes, that because man has no
idea of goodness, he must be naturally wicked; that he is vicious
because he does not know virtue. ... Hobbes did not reflect that the
same cause, which prevents a savage from[]{#calibre_link-3256} making
use of his reason, as our jurists hold, prevents him also from abusing
his faculties, as Hobbes himself allows: so that it may be justly said
that savages are not bad merely because they do not know what it is to
be good: for it is neither the development of the understanding nor the
restraint of law that hinders them from doing ill; but the peacefulness
of their passions, and their ignorance[]{#calibre_link-3257} of vice:
*tanto plus in illis proficit vitiorum ignoratio, quam in his cognitio
virtutis.^[]{#calibre_link-724}[23](#calibre_link-370){.nounder}^*

One knows also from other indications that the economy of pity does not
vary from the *Essay* to the great works. When pity is awakened itself
by imagination and reflection, when sensible presence is exceeded by its
image, we can imagine and judge that the other feels and suffers. Yet,
we neither can nor[]{#calibre_link-3258} should *simply experience* the
suffering of others *by itself*. []{#calibre_link-1071}According to
Rousseau pity does not allow the movement of identification to be simple
and entire. Apparently for two reasons, actually for a single profound
reason. It is a question yet again of a certain *economy*.

1\. We neither can nor should feel the pain of others immediately and
absolutely, for such an interiorization or
identification[]{#calibre_link-3259} would be dangerous and destructive.
That is why the imagination, the reflection, and the judgment that
arouse pity also limit its power and hold the suffering of the other at
a certain distance. One knows this suffering for what it is, one pities
others, but one protects oneself, and holds the evil at arm's length.
This doctrine---which could further be related to the theory of dramatic
representation---is[]{#calibre_link-3260} formulated in both the *Essay*
and *Emile*. The paradox of the relation to the other is clearly
articulated in those two texts: the more you identify with the other,
the better you feel his suffering as *his:* our own suffering is that of
the other. That of the other, as itself, must remain the other's. There
is no authentic identification except in a certain nonidentification,
etc. The *Essay:*

How[]{#calibre_link-3261} are we moved to pity? By getting outside
ourselves and identifying with a being who suffers. We suffer only as
much as we believe him to suffer. It is not in ourselves, but in him
that we suffer \[p. 32\].

*Emile:*

He shares the suffering of his fellow-creatures, but he shares it of his
own free will and finds pleasure in it. He enjoys at once the pity he
feels for their woes and the joy of being[]{#calibre_link-3262} exempt
from them; he feels in himself that state of vigor which projects us
beyond ourselves, and bids us carry elsewhere the superfluous activity
of our well-being. To pity another's woes we must indeed know them, but
we need not feel them (p. 270) \[p. 190\].

We must therefore not let ourselves be destroyed by identification with
others. The economy of pity and of morality must always let
itself[]{#calibre_link-3263} be contained within the limits of the love
of self, all the more because it alone can illuminate the good of others
for us. That is why the maxim of natural goodness: *"Do to others as you
would have them do unto you"* should be tempered by this other maxim,
"much less perfect indeed, but perhaps more useful; *do good to yourself
with as little evil as possible to others"* (Second *Discourse*, p.
156)[]{#calibre_link-3264} \[p. 185\]. The latter is put *"in place"* of
the former.

2\. Further, identification by interiorization would not be moral.

a\) It would not recognize suffering as the suffering of the other.
Morality, respect for the other, therefore supposes a certain
nonidentification. This paradox of pity as relation to the other is
presented by Rousseau also as the paradox of the imagination and of
time, that[]{#calibre_link-3265} is to say of *comparison*. This
concept, so important in Rousseau's thought, is at the center of the
*Essay's* Chapter IX and it intervenes in the explication of pity.

[]{#calibre_link-930}In the experience of suffering as the suffering of
the other, the imagination, as it opens us to a certain nonpresence
within presence, is indispensable: the suffering of others is lived by
comparison, as our nonpresent, past or future[]{#calibre_link-3266}
suffering. Pity would be impossible outside of this structure, which
links imagination, time, and the other as one and the same opening into
nonpresence:

To pity another's woes we must indeed know them, but we need not feel
them. When we have suffered, when we are in fear of suffering, we pity
those who suffer; but when we suffer ourselves, we pity none but
ourselves. (*Emile*, p. 270) \[p. 190\]

[]{#calibre_link-3267}Just before this, Rousseau had explained this
unity of pity and the experience of time in memory or anticipation, in
imagination and nonperception in general:

The bodily effect of our sufferings is less than one would suppose; it
is memory that prolongs the pain, imagination which projects it into the
future, and makes us really to be pitied. This is, I think, one of the
reasons why we are more[]{#calibre_link-3268} callous to the sufferings
of animals than of men, although a fellow-feeling ought to make us
identify ourselves equally with either. We scarcely pity the carthorse
in his shed, for we do not suppose that while he is eating his hay he is
thinking of the blows he has received and the labors in store for him.
*\[Emile\]* (p. 264) \[p. 186\]

b\) Identification pure and simple would be immoral because
it[]{#calibre_link-3269} would remain empirical and would not be
produced in the element of the concept, of universality, and formality.
The condition of morality is that through the unique suffering of a
unique being, through his presence and his empirical existence, humanity
gives itself up to pity. As long as this condition is not fulfilled,
pity risks becoming unjust. Imagination and temporality therefore open
the reign[]{#calibre_link-3270} of concept and law. One may say that
already for Rousseau, the concept---which he also calls
comparison---[]{#calibre_link-3271}[]{#calibre_link-3272}*exists* as
time. It is for him, as Hegel will say---*Dasein*. Pity is contemporary
with speech and representation:

To prevent pity degenerating into weakness we must generalize it and
extend it to mankind. Then we only yield to it when it is in accordance
with justice, since justice is of all the virtues that which contributes
most to the common good. Reason and self-love compel us to love
mankind[]{#calibre_link-3273} even more than our neighbor, and to pity
the wicked is to be very cruel to other men. (pp. 303--04) *\[Emile*, p.
215\]^[]{#calibre_link-725}[24](#calibre_link-371){.nounder}^

On this point there is no development in Rousseau's thought. It seems to
me that one cannot draw an *internal* argument out of this in order to
conclude a precociousness or a philosophical anteriority for the
*Essay*. For the moment, the field of external hypotheses is thus
opened,[]{#calibre_link-3274} even if we []{#calibre_link-810}reserve
the possibility of raising other internal problems when the time comes.

[]{#calibre_link-35}***The Initial Debate and the Composition of the
Essay*.** To treat the external problem, we shall deal with some
declarations by Rousseau himself in addition to the quotations from
Duclos. First an important passage from the *Confessions*. From it one
may at least conclude that the *Essay*, originally
conceived[]{#calibre_link-3275} as an appendix to the second
*Discourse*, was, in Rousseau's mind, quite separate from his first
writings on music. The time is 1761:

Besides these two works and my "Dictionnaire de Musique," at which I
worked from time to time, I had some other writings of less importance,
all ready for publication, which I intended to bring out, either
separately or in a general collection of my works, if I
ever[]{#calibre_link-3276} undertook to produce one. The most important
of these, most of which are still in manuscript in the hands of Du
Peyrou, was an "Essai sur l'Origine des Langues," which I had read to M.
de Malesherbes and the Chevalier de Lorenzi, who expressed his approval
of it. I calculated that all these works together, after all expenses,
would be worth to me at least 8,000 or 10,000 francs, which I
intended[]{#calibre_link-3277} to sink in a life-annuity for myself and
Therese. After this, we would go and live together in the corner of some
province (p. 560) \[pp. 580--81\].

Malesherbes advised him to publish the *Essay*
separately.^[]{#calibre_link-726}[25](#calibre_link-372){.nounder}^ All
this happened in 1761, at the time of the publication of *Emile*.

From the external point of view, the problem thus seems simple, and we
can consider it as closed more than fifty years
ago[]{#calibre_link-3278} by Masson in an article of
1913.^[]{#calibre_link-727}[26](#calibre_link-373){.nounder}^ The
polemic had been opened by
Espinas.^[]{#calibre_link-728}[27](#calibre_link-374){.nounder}^
Fastening upon what he considered to be contradictions in Rousseau's
thought, he was already stressing what in the *Essay* and even in the
article *Economie politique* in the *Encyclopaedia* (an article that
poses analogous problems of dating and of internal relationships with
the *Discourse*) seemed to him to oppose the
Second[]{#calibre_link-3279} *Discourse*. Thus, for example, the
*Discourse*, which begins by "setting aside all facts" in order to
describe an ideal structure or an ideal genesis, is in his view
incompatible with the *Essay*, which calls to some extent upon Genesis,
alludes to names like Adam, Cain, Noah, and deals with a certain factual
content which belongs to history as well as to myth. One must of course
study carefully Rousseau's[]{#calibre_link-3280} usage of this factual
content, and examine if, by using it as a guide to reading or to pivotal
examples, Rousseau does not neutralize it as fact---a step which he
permits himself to take in the *Discourse* as well; notably in those
notes to the *Discourse* among which, as we know, the *Essay* was
perhaps supposed to be included.

Whatever the case may be, unlike Starobinski, Espinas does not
conclude[]{#calibre_link-3281} from this supposed contradiction that the
*Essay* came before the *Discourse*. []{#calibre_link-865}Considering
the quotations from Duclos, he draws the opposite conclusion: the
*Essay* came after the
*Discourse.^[]{#calibre_link-729}[28](#calibre_link-375){.nounder}^*

Lanson then contests this
interpretation.^[]{#calibre_link-730}[29](#calibre_link-376){.nounder}^
But always on the same grounds: the *discrepancy* between the *Essay*
and the major works. For the sake of the philosophical reasons which
constitute the real stakes of[]{#calibre_link-3282} this debate and
indeed animate it, Lanson wishes at all costs to preserve the unity of
Rousseau's thought as it was to fulfill itself in its
"maturity."^[]{#calibre_link-731}[30](#calibre_link-377){.nounder}^

He must therefore relegate the *Essay* to a place among the works of
Rousseau's youth:

The *Essay on the Origin of Languages* is certainly in contradiction
with the *Discourse on Inequality*. But what proof does M. Espinas have
for placing the former[]{#calibre_link-3283} chronologically after the
latter, and very close to it? Some passages quoted by Rousseau from a
work by Duclos that appeared in 1754. What value does this argument
have, since it is known moreover that the text of the *Essay* was
revised by Rousseau at least once or twice? The quotations from Duclos
could have entered the text at one of those revisions. For my part, I
have reason to believe through[]{#calibre_link-3284} certain positive
indications that the *Essay on the Origin of Languages* dates from an
epoch when Rousseau's systematic views were not yet formed, and that
under its original title (*Essai sur le principe de la mélodie*), it was
a reply to Rameau's *Démonstration du principe de l'harmonie*
(1749--1750). By its matter and tenor, the *Essay* comes out of the same
current of thought which exists in Condillac's[]{#calibre_link-3285} *An
Essay on the Origin of Human Knowledge* (1746) and in Diderot's *Lettre
sur les sourds et muets* (1750--1751). I should be much inclined to
place the composition of Rousseau's *Essay* at the latest in 1750,
between the composition and the success of the first *Discourse*.

It is difficult to consider the quotations from Duclos as late
insertions. Even if in fact they were, as quotations, late,
the[]{#calibre_link-3286} reading of the *Commentary on General Grammar*
seems to have deeply marked, indeed inspired, the entire *Essay*. As for
affinities with Condillac and Diderot, they are far from limited to this
work alone.

That is why, on this problem of chronology whose external aspect is so
difficult to delimit, Masson's response to Lanson seems eminently
convincing to
me.^[]{#calibre_link-732}[31](#calibre_link-378){.nounder}^ Here I
extract a long fragment of it.

[]{#calibre_link-3287}Recalling Lanson's argument, Masson writes:

These arguments are very skillful and almost convincing; but perhaps
they presented themselves to M. Lanson only because he did not wish to
find Rousseau in "contradiction" with himself. If the *Essay* had not
seemed to "contradict" the second *Discourse*, who knows if M. Lanson
would have pushed the original version so far back? I do not wish to
examine[]{#calibre_link-3288} here the internal relationships between
the *Essay* and *Inequality;* in my opinion, the "contradiction" between
the two works is not as "certain" as M. Lanson judges. I shall limit
myself to two external remarks that seem decisive to me. 1) The
[]{#calibre_link-888}manuscript of the *Essay on the Origin of
Languages* is still at the Library of Neuchâtel, No. 7835 (5 paperbound
books, 150 × 230mm., bound, with a blue silk[]{#calibre_link-3289}
ribbon). Very beautifully written, obviously intended for the press, it
carries on the first page: by J.-J. Rousseau, Citizen of Geneva. It is
without a doubt the copy that Jean-Jacques transcribed in 1761, when he
thought for a while of using this work in reply to "that Rameau who
continued to mistreat him so villainously" (letter to Malesherbes,
9.25.61). Later, very likely at Motiers, as we[]{#calibre_link-3290}
shall see, he took the copy up again for revision, additions, or
corrections, easily recognizable, for the ink and the writing are quite
different. If I were studying the *Essay*
itself,^[]{#calibre_link-733}[32](#calibre_link-379){.nounder}^ these
variants would be worth noting; but I have kept only those corrections
which are of chronological significance. In the copy of 1761, the text
forms a whole: it is one dissertation; the division into
chapters[]{#calibre_link-3291} was introduced in Motiers' revision. Thus
it is not only to Chapter 20, but to the entire *Essay* that the last
lines of the work apply: "These superficial reflections, which hopefully
might give birth to more profound ones, I shall conclude with the
passage that suggested them to me: To *observe in fact and to show by
examples, the degree to which the character, customs and interests of a
people[]{#calibre_link-3292} influence their language, would provide
material for a sufficiently philosophical investigation"* \[pp.
73--74\]. This "passage" is extracted from Duclos' books, *Remarques sur
la grammaire génerale et raisonnée*, p. 11, which appeared in the first
half of 1754. 2) We have also a more formal testimony given by Rousseau
himself. About 1763, he wished to bring together in one small volume
three short[]{#calibre_link-3293} works that he had in hand:
*L'imitation théâtrale, Essay on the Origin of Languages, Le Lévite
d'Ephraim*. The collection was never published, but a projected preface
remains in one of his notebooks of rough drafts (Mss of Neuchâtel, No.
7887 F^os^ 104--05). From that preface I omit what concerns *Theatrical
Imitation* and *The Levite*, and publish the paragraph concerning the
*Essay^[]{#calibre_link-734}[33](#calibre_link-380){.nounder}^:* "the
second part[]{#calibre_link-3294} was at first nothing but a part of the
*Discourse on Inequality*, that I cut off from it as too long and out of
place. I took it up again \[Rousseau had at first written: I completed
it\]---provoked by M. *Rameau's Errors on Music*---that title which is
perfectly fulfilled by the work which bears it---but for two words that
I had struck off \[in the *Encyclopaedia\]*. However, restrained by the
ridiculousness[]{#calibre_link-3295} of holding forth upon languages
when one hardly knows one, and, furthermore, discontented with that
fragment, I had resolved to suppress it as unworthy of public attention.
But an illustrious magistrate, who cultivates and protects letters
\[Malesherbes\], thought of it more favorably than I; I defer with
pleasure, as one may well believe, my judgment to his, and with the help
of other writings, I[]{#calibre_link-3296} attempt to pass off a piece
that I might not have risked by itself." It does not seem that any
internal evidence can stand against this testimony by Rousseau himself.
In 1754, then, the *Essay* on languages was a long note to the second
*Discourse;* in 1761, it became an independent dissertation, augmented
and corrected to make it a riposte to Rameau. Finally, in 1763, this
dissertation, revised for[]{#calibre_link-3297} one last time, was
divided into chapters.

#### **[]{#calibre_link-772}*II. Imitation*** {#calibre_link-36 .h3}

We have now been brought quite naturally to the problem of the
*composition* of the *Essay:* not only of the time of its writing, but
of the space of its structure. Rousseau divided it into chapters
belatedly. What scheme guided him? The architecture must find its
justification in the deep intention of the *Essay*. It is for that
reason that it[]{#calibre_link-3298} interests us. Yet we must not
confound the meaning of the architecture with the declared intention of
the work.

Twenty chapters of most unequal length. A disquiet *seems* to animate
all Rousseau's reflections and to give them their vehemence: they are
concerned *at first* with the origin and degeneration of music. The
chapters that concern music, its emergence and its decadence, are
contained between[]{#calibre_link-3299} Chapter 12, "The Origin of Music
and its Relations," and Chapter 19, "How Music Has Degenerated." If one
wants to maintain that the destiny of music is the major preoccupation
of the *Essay*, it must be explained that the chapters that directly
concern that subject occupy hardly a third of the work (a little more if
you consider the number of chapters, a little less if you consider the
number of[]{#calibre_link-3300} pages) and that the rest of the essay
does not deal with it at all. Whatever may be the history of its
writing, its unity of composition is not the less evident and no
development is out of alignment.

[]{#calibre_link-37}***The Interval and the Supplement*.** The themes of
the first eleven chapters are the genesis and degeneration of language,
the relationships between speech and writing, the difference between the
formation[]{#calibre_link-3301} of the languages of the north and the
languages of the south. Why is it necessary to treat these problems
before proposing a theory of music? For several types of reasons.

1\. There is no music before language. Music is born of voice and not of
sound. No prelinguistic sonority can, according to Rousseau, open the
time of music. In the beginning is the song.

This proposition is absolutely necessary[]{#calibre_link-3302} within
Rousseau's systematics. If music awakens in song, if it is initially
uttered, *vociferated*, it is because, like all speech, it is born in
passion. That is to say in the transgression of need by desire and the
awakening of pity by imagination. Everything proceeds from this
inaugural distinction: "It seems then that need dictated the first
gestures, while the passions wrung forth the first[]{#calibre_link-3303}
words."

If music presupposes voice, it comes into being at the same time as
human society. As speech, it requires that the other be present to me as
other through compassion. Animals, whose pity is not awakened by the
imagination, have no affinity with the other as such. That is why there
is no animal music. One speaks of animal music only by looseness of
vocabulary []{#calibre_link-1051}and by anthropomorphic
projection.[]{#calibre_link-3304} The difference between the glance and
the voice is the difference between animality and humanity.
Transgressing space, mastering the outside, placing souls in
communication, voice transcends natural animality. That is to say a
certain death signified by space. Exteriority is inanimate. The arts of
space carry death within themselves and *animality* remains the
*inanimate* face of *life*. The song presents[]{#calibre_link-3305} life
to itself. In that sense, it is more *natural* to man but more foreign
to a nature which is in itself dead nature \[still life\]. One sees here
what difference---at the same time interior and exterior---divides the
significations of nature, life, animality, humanity, art, speech, and
song. The animal who, as we have seen, has no relationship to death, is
on the side of death. Speech, on the other[]{#calibre_link-3306} hand,
is *living* speech even while it institutes a relation to death, and so
on. It is presence in general that is thus divided. "From this it is
evident that painting is closer to nature and that music is more
dependent on human art. It is evident also that the one is more
interesting than the other precisely because it does more to relate man
to man, and gives us some idea of our kind.
Painting[]{#calibre_link-3307} is often dead and inanimate. It can carry
you to the depth of the desert; but as soon as vocal signs strike your
ear, they announce to you a being like yourself. They are, so to speak,
the organs of the soul. If they also paint solitude for you *\[s'ils
vous peignent aussi la solitude\]*, they tell you you are not there
alone. Birds whistle; man alone sings. And one cannot hear either
singing or a[]{#calibre_link-3308} symphony without immediately
acknowledging the presence of another intelligent being" (Chap. XVI)
\[pp. 63--64\].

Song is at the orient of music but it does not reduce itself to voice
any more than voice reduces itself to noise. In the *Dictionary of
Music*, Rousseau confesses his embarrassment in the article *Song
\[chant; tune* in the contemporary English translation\]. If the song is
indeed "a kind[]{#calibre_link-3309} of modification of the human voice"
it is difficult to assign to it an absolutely characteristic
*\[propre\]* modality. After having proposed the *"calcula \[tions\] of
intervals,"* Rousseau advances the most equivocal criterion of
*"permanence,"* and then of melody as *"imitation* of the accents of the
speaking or passionate voice." The difficulty is that the concepts of an
intrinsic and systematic description[]{#calibre_link-3310} must be
found. No more than the
voice^[]{#calibre_link-735}[34](#calibre_link-381){.nounder}^ does the
song disclose its essence in an anatomical description. But vocal
intervals are also alien to the system of musical intervals. Rousseau
therefore hesitates, in the *Dictionary* as much as in the *Essay*,
between two necessities: of marking the difference between the systems
of vocal and musical intervals, but also of reserving all the resources
of song[]{#calibre_link-3311} in the original voice. The notion of
*imitation* reconciles these two exigencies within ambiguity. The first
chapter of the *Essay* corresponds in part to this passage in the
article *Song*:

[]{#calibre_link-886}It is very difficult to determine in what the voice
which forms the words, differs from that which forms the *song*. This
difference is sensible, but we cannot very clearly perceive in what it
consists, and when[]{#calibre_link-3312} we seek to find it, we find it
not. Mons. Dodart has made anatomic observations, by favor of which he
thinks really to discover, in the different situations of the larynx,
the cause of two kinds of voice. But I do not know if these observations
or the consequences drawn from them, are to be depended on. There seems
to be wanting to the sounds which form the discourse, no more than
*permanence*,[]{#calibre_link-3313} to form a real *song*: It appears
also, that the different inflexions which we give to the voice in
speaking, form intervals which are not at all harmonic, *which form no
parts of the system in our music*, and which consequently not being
expressed in notes, are not properly a *song* for us. *The song does not
seem natural to mankind*. Tho' the savages of America sing, because they
speak, yet *a true savage[]{#calibre_link-3314} never sung*. The dumb
don't sing, they form only accents without permanence, a disgustful
*\[sourds*---muted\] bellowing which their wants draw from them. I
should doubt, if the Sieur Pereyre, with all his ingenuity, could ever
draw from them any musical air. Children scream, cry, but they don't
sing. The first expressions of nature have nothing in them melodious or
sonorous, and they \[children\] learn[]{#calibre_link-3315} to sing, as
to speak, from our example. The melodious and appreciable tune, is only
an artificial imitation of the accents in the speaking or passionate
voice. *We cry, we complain, without singing; but, in song, we imitate
cries and laments; and as, of all imitations, the most interesting is
that of the human passions, so of all the methods of imitating, the most
agreeable is the song*. (Only the[]{#calibre_link-3316} word song
*\[chant\]* is italicized by Rousseau.)

Through that example one may analyze the subtle functioning of the
notions of nature and imitation. On several levels, nature is the
ground, the inferior step: it must be crossed, exceeded, but also
rejoined. We must return to it, but without annulling the difference.
This difference, separating the imitation from what it imitates, must be
*almost[]{#calibre_link-3317} nil*. Through the voice one must
transgress the nature that is animal, savage, mute, infant or crying; by
singing transgress or modify the voice. But the song must imitate cries
and laments. This leads to a second polar determination of nature: it
becomes the unity---as ideal limit---of the imitation and what is
imitated, of voice and song. If that unity were accomplished, imitation
would become useless:[]{#calibre_link-3318} the unity of unity and
difference would be lived in immediacy. Such, according to Rousseau, is
the archeo-teleologic definition of nature. *Elsewhere* is the name and
the place, the name of the nonplace of that nature. Elsewhere in time,
*in illo tempore;* elsewhere in space, *alibi*. The natural unity of the
cry, the voice, and the song, is the proto-Greek or the Chinese
experience. The article *Voice*[]{#calibre_link-3319} analyses and
amplifies the same debate around the theses of Dodart and of Duclos (in
the article *Déclamation des anciens* in the *Encyclopaedia*). The
differences among languages are measured by the distance which, in the
system of each []{#calibre_link-3320}language, separates the voice of
speech from the voice of song, "for as there are languages more or less
harmonious, whose accents are more or less musical, we
take[]{#calibre_link-3321} notice also, in these languages, that the
speaking and singing *voices* are connected or removed in the same
proportion. So, as the Italian language is more musical than the French,
its speaking is less distant from song; and in that language it is
easier to recognize a man singing if we have heard him speak. In a
language which would be completely harmonious, as was the Greek at the
beginning,[]{#calibre_link-3322} the difference between the speaking and
singing voices would be nil. We should have the same voice for speaking
and singing. Perhaps that may be at present the case of the Chinese"
\[p. 464\].

2\. We have just accepted two pieces of evidence: the unity of nature or
the identity of origin is shaped and undermined by a strange difference
which constitutes it by breaching it; we must account for
the[]{#calibre_link-3323} origin of the *voice of speech*---therefore of
society---*before* assigning, and *in order to assign*, its possibility
to music, that is to say to the *voice of song*. But since in the
*beginning* of the *all-harmonious* voice, word and song are (were)
identified, *before and in order to* have perhaps a juridical or
methodological meaning; they have no structural or genetic value. One
might have been tempted to[]{#calibre_link-3324} accord a structural
value to the difference between speech and song, since Rousseau
recognized that the latter comes to "modify" the former. But the
archeoteleological concept of nature also annuls the structural point of
view. In the beginning or in the ideal of the all-harmonious voice, the
modification becomes one with the substance that it modifies. (This
scheme has a general value and governs[]{#calibre_link-3325} all
discourses, from the moment that they make the smallest appeal to any of
these notions, no matter which one: nature and its other, archeology and
eschatology, substance and mode, origin and genesis.)

Of course, the methodological or juridical point of view has no rigorous
value the moment the difference of value between the structural and
genetic points of view is annulled. Rousseau does[]{#calibre_link-3326}
not notice this consequence but we should recognize that it would wreak
havoc to more than one discourse.

We must now study the consequence. It is a matter of presenting, with
reference to the origin of language and society, a certain number of
oppositions of concepts indispensable for understanding at the same time
the possibility of both speech and song. And above all for understanding
the[]{#calibre_link-3327} tension or the difference that, in language as
in music, operates at once as opening and menace, principle of life and
of death. Since *the first* speech must be *good*, since the
archeo-teleology of the nature of the language and the language of
nature dictate to us, as does "the voice of nature," that the original
and ideal essence of speech is song itself, one cannot treat the two
origins separately.[]{#calibre_link-3328} But as the method of the
discourse must retrace its path []{#calibre_link-3329}and take into
account the historical regression or degradation, it must separate the
two questions provisionally and, in a certain manner, begin with the
end.

This then is the story. For the history that follows the origin and is
added to it is nothing but the story of the separation between song and
speech. If we consider the difference[]{#calibre_link-3330} which
fractured the origin, it must be said that this history, which is
decadence and degeneracy through and through, had no prehistory.
Degeneration as separation, severing of voice and song, has always
already begun. We shall see that Roussau's entire text *describes*
origin as the beginning of the end, as the inaugural decadence. Yet, in
spite of that description, the text twists about in a
sort[]{#calibre_link-3331} of oblique effort to act *as if* degeneration
were not prescribed in the genesis and as if evil *supervened upon* a
good origin. As if song and speech, which have the same act and the same
birthpangs, had not always already begun to separate themselves.

Here one reencounters the advantages and dangers of the concept of the
supplement, and also of the concept of "fatal advantage" and "dangerous
supplement."

[]{#calibre_link-3332}
:::

The growth of music, the desolating separation of song and speech, has
the form of writing as "dangerous supplement": calculation and
grammaticality, *loss of energy and substitution*. The history of music
is parallel to the history of the language, its evil is in essense
graphic. When he undertakes to explain *how music has degenerated*
(Chapter 19), Rousseau recalls the unhappy history of the
language[]{#calibre_link-3333} and of its disastrous "perfecting": "To
the degree that the language improved, melody, being governed by new
rules, imperceptibly *lost* its *former energy*, and the *calculus of
intervals was substituted for nicety of inflection"* (italics added)
\[p. 68\].

Substitution distances from birth, from the natural or maternal origin.
Forgetfulness of the beginning is a calculation that puts harmony in
the[]{#calibre_link-3334} place of melody, the science of intervals in
the place of the warmth of accent. In this weaning of the voice of
speech, a "new object" comes at once to usurp and compensate for the
"maternal traits." What suffers then from this is the "oral accent."
Music thus finds itself "deprived of its" proper, that is to say natural
and moral, "effects": "Melody being *forgotten*, and the attention of
musicians[]{#calibre_link-3335} being completely turned toward harmony,
everything gradually came to be governed according to this *new object*.
The genres, the modes, the scale, all received new faces. Harmonic
successions came to dictate the sequence of parts. This sequence having
*usurped the name* of melody, it was, in effect, impossible to recognize
the *traits of its mother* in this new melody. And our musical system
having[]{#calibre_link-3336} thus *gradually* become purely harmonic, it
is not surprising that its *oral tone \[accent\]* has *suffered*, and
that our music has lost almost all its *energy*. Thus we see how singing
*gradually* became an art entirely *separate* from speech, from which
[]{#calibre_link-3337}it takes its origin; how the harmonics of sounds
resulted in the *forgetting* of vocal inflections; and finally, how
music, restricted to purely physical concurrences[]{#calibre_link-3338}
of vibrations, found itself *deprived* of the moral power it had yielded
when it was the *twofold voice of nature"* (italics added) \[p. 71\].

The points italicized in the passage should guide a subreading of this
text and of many analogous texts. On each occasion one would notice:

1\. That Rousseau weaves his text with heterogeneous threads: the
instanteous *displacement* that *substitutes* a *"new
object,"*[]{#calibre_link-3339} which institutes a substitutive
supplement, must constitute a history, a progressive becoming
*gradually* producing the *forgetting* of the voice of nature. The
violent and irruptive movement that *usurps, separates* and *deprives*
is simultaneously described as a progressive implicating of, and a
gradual distancing from, the origin, a slow growth of a disease of
language. Weaving together the two significations[]{#calibre_link-3340}
of supplementarity---substitution and accretion---Rousseau describes the
replacement of an *object* as a deficit in *energy*, the production of a
re-placement as effacement by forgetting.

2\. The adverb "doubly" \[twofold\] summons up in its own condition of
possibility the metaphor of the voice of nature: "gentle voice,"
maternal voice, song as original voice, sung speech conforms to the
prescriptions[]{#calibre_link-3341} of natural law. In every sense of
this word, nature speaks. And to hear and understand the laws formed by
her gentle voice---which, as we recall, "no one is tempted to disobey,"
but which one must have been tempted to disobey---it is necessary to
find again the "oral accent" of sung speech, take possession again of
our own lost voice, the voice which, uttering and hearing,
understanding-itself-signifying[]{#calibre_link-3342} a melodious law,
"was the twofold voice of nature."

[]{#calibre_link-38}***The Engraving and the Ambiguities of
Formalism*.** How was this supplementary substitution fatal? How *is* it
fatal? How *was it to be*---for such is the time of its
*quiddity*---what it necessarily is? What is the fissure that, within
the origin itself, destines its appearance?

This fissure is not one among others. It is *the* fissure: the necessity
of interval,[]{#calibre_link-3343} the harsh law of spacing. It could
not endanger song except by being inscribed in it from its birth and in
its essence. Spacing is not the accident of song. Or rather, as accident
and accessory, fall and supplement, it is also that without which,
strictly speaking, the song would not have come into being. In the
*Dictionary*, the interval is a part of the definition of song. It is
therefore, so[]{#calibre_link-3344} to speak, an originary accessory and
an essential accident. Like writing.

Rousseau says it without wishing to say
it.[]{#calibre_link-1181}[\*](#calibre_link-382){.nounder} What he
wishes to say is: []{#calibre_link-891}accessory accessory, accidental
accident, the exterior outside, the supplementary evil or the accessory
supplement. And space exterior to time. Spacing alien to the time of
melody. As we shall see, even while saying that spacing assures the
possibility[]{#calibre_link-3345} of speech and song. Rousseau *wishes*
to think of space as a simple outside by way of which disease and death
in general, and especially the disease and death of sung speech, make
their entry. He wishes to pretend that the "fineness of infections" and
of the "oral accent" did not already and always lend itself to
spatialization, geometricization, grammaticalization, regularization,
prescription;[]{#calibre_link-3346} or to reason. As he wishes to efface
this *always-already*, he determines spacing as an event and as a
catastrophic event. We shall have to come back more than once to that
concept of catastrophe. Let us note here that this catastrophe has
indeed the form of philosophic reason. That is why the birth of
philosophy during the epoch of Greek tragedy constitutes the best
example of such a catastrophe:

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-3347}
:::

When the theaters had taken a regular form, all singing was according to
prescribed modes. And, to the degree that the rules of imitation
proliferated, imitative language was enfeebled. The study of philosophy
and the progress of reasoning, while having perfected grammar, deprived
language of its vital, passionate quality which made it so singable.
Composers, who originally were engaged by poets[]{#calibre_link-3348}
and worked only for them, under their direction so to speak, were
becoming independent as early as the time of Melanippides and
Philoxenus. This is the license of which Music complains so bitterly in
a comedy of Pherecrates, according to the passage preserved by Plutarch.
Thus melody, originally an aspect of discourse, imperceptibly assumes a
separate existence and music becomes more
independent[]{#calibre_link-3349} of speech. That is also when it
stopped producing the marvels it had produced when it was merely the
accent and harmony of poetry and gave to it the power over the passions
that speech subsequently exercised only on reason. Thus, as soon as
Greece became full of sophists and philosophers, she no longer had any
famous musicians or poets. In cultivating the art of convincing, that of
arousing the[]{#calibre_link-3350} emotions was lost. Plato himself,
envious of Homer and Euripides, decried the one and was unable to
imitate the other. \[*Essay*, pp. 68--69\]

Further, according to the law of supplementary acceleration that we
noticed above and that we could call the law of *geometric regression*,
another catastrophe necessarily adds itself to the first. Almost all the
significations that will constantly define the[]{#calibre_link-3351}
figure of evil and the process of its degeneration are recorded there: a
simultaneously violent and progressive substitution of servitude for
political freedom as freedom of the living word, dissolution of the
small democratic and autarchic city, preponderance of articulation over
accentuation, of consonant over vowel, of northern over southern, of the
capital over the province. Going necessarily[]{#calibre_link-3352} in
the direction []{#calibre_link-978}of the first catastrophe, the
supplementary catastrophe nevertheless destroys its positive or
compensating effects. Let us italicize:

*Servitude* soon *joined* forces with philosophy. In fetters, Greece
lost the fire that warms only free spirits, and in praising her tyrants,
she never recovered the style *\[ton\]* in which she had sung her
heroes. The intermingling of the Romans further[]{#calibre_link-3353}
weakened whatever harmony and accent remained to the language. Latin, a
less musical, more *surded \[mute\]* tongue, did harm to the music in
adopting it. The singing employed in the *capital* gradually corrupted
that of the provinces. The Roman theaters harmed *\[nuisirent à*\] those
of Athens. When Nero carried off the prize, Greece had ceased to merit
any. And the same melodiousness, parceled between[]{#calibre_link-3354}
two tongues, had become less well suited to either. Finally came the
*catastrophe that disrupted the progress of the human spirit without
removing the faults that were its product*. Europe, flooded with
*barbarians, enslaved* by ignoramuses, lost at the same time her
sciences, her arts, and that universal instrument of both: that is,
*harmoniously perfected language*. Imperceptibly, these coarse
men[]{#calibre_link-3355} engendered by the *North* made every ear
accustomed to their rude voices. Their harsh, *expressionless \[dénuée
d'accent\]* voices were noisy without being sonorous. The Emperor Julian
compared Gallic speech to the croaking of frogs. All their
*articulations*, like their voices, being nasal and *muffled*, they
could give only some kind of distinctness to their singing, augmenting
the vowel sounds to cover[]{#calibre_link-3356} up *the abundance and
harshness of the consonants*. (Chap. 19) \[*Essay*, p. 69\]

In addition to the system of oppositions that controls the entire
*Essay* (servitude/politico-linguistic liberty, North/South,
articulation/accent, consonant/vowel, capital/province//autarchic and
democratic city), we may perceive here the strange workings of the
historical process according to Rousseau. It never
varies:[]{#calibre_link-3357} beginning with an origin or a center that
divides itself and leaves itself, an historical circle is described,
which is degenerative in direction but progressive and compensatory in
effect. On the circumference of that circle are new origins for new
circles that accelerate the degeneration by annulling the compensatory
effects of the preceding circle, and thereby also making its truth and
beneficence[]{#calibre_link-3358} appear. It is thus, by destroying the
"progress of the human spirit" that the anterior cycle had produced,
that the invasion of the northern barbarians ushered in a new cycle of
historical degeneration. The harmful and dissolving effects of
philosophy had in fact been limited by themselves. Their system
comprised, in some way, its own curb. Within the following system or
circle, that curb will[]{#calibre_link-3359} have disappeared. Follows
an acceleration of evil, which nevertheless will find a new internal
regulation, a new organ of equilibrium, a new supplementary compensation
(which will consist for example of "reinforcing vowel sounds to cover
the abundance and harshness of consonants"), and thus to infinity. But
this infinity is still not that of a horizon or an abyss, of a progress
or a fall. It is[]{#calibre_link-3360} the infinity of a repetition
following a strange course. For the preceding diagram must be
complicated further: each new cycle []{#calibre_link-3361}begins a
progression-regression which, destroying the effects of the preceding
one, brings us back to a nature yet more secret, more ancient, more
archaic. Progress consists always of taking us closer to animality while
annulling the progress through which we have
transgressed[]{#calibre_link-3362} animality. I shall confirm it often.
In any case, it would be difficult to represent the "thus to infinity"
of this movement by the tracing of a line, however complicated that line
might be.

What cannot be thus represented by a line is the turn (trick/trope) of
the re-turn when it has the bearing of re-presentation. What one-cannot
represent is the relationship of representation to
so-called[]{#calibre_link-3363} originary presence. The re-presentation
is also a de-presentation. It is tied to the work of spacing.

Spacing insinuates into presence an interval which not only separates
the different times of speech and of song but also the represented from
the representer. Such an interval is prescribed by the origin of art as
determined by Rousseau. According to a tradition that remains
imperturbable here,[]{#calibre_link-3364} Rousseau is sure that the
essence of art is *mimesis*. Imitation redoubles presence, adds itself
to it by supplementing it. Thus it makes the present pass into its
outside. In the inanimate arts, the outside is split and it is the
reproduction of the outside in the outside. The presence of the thing
itself is already exposed in exteriority, it must therefore be
depresented and represented in an[]{#calibre_link-3365} outside of the
outside. In the living arts, and preeminently in song, the outside
imitates the inside. It is *expressive*. It "paints" passions. The
metaphor which makes the song a painting is possible, it can wrest from
itself and drag outside into space the intimacy of its virtue, only
under the common authority of the concept of imitation. Painting and
song are reproductions, whatever might be[]{#calibre_link-3366} their
differences; the inside and the outside share them equally, expression
has already begun to make passion go outside itself, it has begun to set
it forth and to paint it.

That confirms what we proposed above: imitation cannot allow itself to
be appreciated by a simple act. Rousseau has need of imitation, he
advances it as the possibility of song and the emergence out of
animality, but he[]{#calibre_link-3367} exalts it only as a reproduction
adding itself to the represented though it *adds nothing*, simply
supplements it. In that sense he praises art or *mimesis* as a
supplement. But by the same token praise may instantly turn to
criticism. Since the supplementary mimesis adds *nothing*, is it not
useless? And if nevertheless, adding itself to the represented, it is
not nothing, is that imitative supplement[]{#calibre_link-3368} not
dangerous to the integrity of what is represented and to the original
purity of nature?

This is why, travelling along the system of supplementarity with a blind
infallibility, and the sure foot of the sleepwalker, Rousseau must at
once denounce *mimesis* and art as supplements (supplements that are
dangerous when they are not useless, superfluous when they are not
disastrous, []{#calibre_link-1072}in truth both[]{#calibre_link-3369} at
the same time) and recognize in them man's good fortune, the expression
of passion, the emergence from the inanimate.

It is the status of the *sign* that is marked by the same ambiguity.
Signifier imitates signified. Art is woven with signs. In so far as
signification seems to be, at first glance at least, nothing but an
instance of imitation, let us turn to *Emile*. The ambiguity of the
treatment[]{#calibre_link-3370} reserved for imitation in that book will
clarify those passages in the *Essay* that deal with the sign, art, and
imitation.

Pedagogy cannot help but encounter the problem of imitation. What is
example? Should one educate by example or explanation? Should the
teacher make an example of himself and not interfere any further, or
pile lesson upon exhortation? And is there virtue in being virtuous
by[]{#calibre_link-3371} imitation? All these questions are asked in the
second book of *Emile*.

The problem at first is knowing how to teach generosity or "liberality"
to the child. Even before the word and the theme of imitation occupy the
front of the stage, the problem of the sign is posed. To teach the child
true generosity is to make sure that he is not content only to imitate
it. What does it mean to imitate generosity?[]{#calibre_link-3372} It is
to give signs in the place of things, words in the place of sentiments,
money in the place of real goods. Therefore the child must be taught not
to imitate liberality, and this teaching must combat resistance. The
child spontaneously wants to guard his goods and put one off the scent
\[literally, give away the coin\]: "Observe that the only things
children are set to give are things of[]{#calibre_link-3373} which they
do not know the value, bits of metal carried in their pockets for which
they have no further use. A child would rather give a hundred coins than
one cake" *\[Emile*, p. 67\]. What one gives easily is not signifiers
inseparable from signifieds or things, it is the devalued signifiers.
The child would not give away money so easily if he knew how to, or
could, do something with it. "But get[]{#calibre_link-3374} this
prodigal giver to distribute what is dear to him, his toys, his sweets,
his own lunch, and we shall soon see if you have made him really
generous" (*Emile*, pp. 97--99) \[p. 67\].

Not that the child is naturally greedy. He desires naturally to keep
what he desires. It is normal and natural. Here vice or perversity would
consist of not attaching oneself to things that are naturally desirable
but[]{#calibre_link-3375} to their substitutive signifiers. If a child
loved money for money's sake, he would be perverse; he would no longer
be a child. *For Rousseau the concept of the child is always related to
the sign. More precisely, childhood is the nonrelation to the sign as
such*. But what is a sign as such? There is no sign as such. Either the
sign is considered a thing, and it is not a sign. Or it is a
reference,[]{#calibre_link-3376} and thus not itself. According to
Rousseau, the child is the name of that which should not relate in any
way to a separated signifier, loved in some way for itself, like a
fetish. This perverse use of the signifier is in a certain way at once
forbidden and tolerated by the structure of imitation.
[]{#calibre_link-1002}As soon as a signifier is no longer imitative,
undoubtedly the threat of perversion becomes
acute.[]{#calibre_link-3377} But already within imitation, the gap
between the thing and its double, that is to say between the sense and
its image, assures a lodging for falsehood, falsification, and vice.

Hence the hesitation in *Emile*. On the one hand, everything begins with
imitation and the child learns only by example. Here *imitation is
good*, it is more human, it has nothing to do with aping. Those who,
following Locke's[]{#calibre_link-3378} argument, give children reasons
for the advantage of being liberal rather than examples of liberality,
would in fact be the deceptive ones. One will never pass from that
"usurious liberality" to the true generosity that is transmitted only by
example and *good imitation:* "Teachers, have done with these shams; be
good and kind; let your example sink into your scholars' memories until
they can enter[]{#calibre_link-3379} their hearts" *\[Emile*, p. 68\].

But this good imitation already carries within itself the premises of
its corruption *\[altération\]*. And all the problems of pedagogy in
*Emile* may be summarized in this fact. The child is at first passive,
the example engraves itself within the memory, *"waiting"* to enter the
heart. It may remain in the memory without entering the heart; and
conversely, because of the[]{#calibre_link-3380} resemblance between the
heart and memory, the child may feign feeling from the heart when he
actually contents himself with imitating according to the signs of
memory. He may always content himself with *giving signs*. A first time,
good imitation may be impossible, a second time, it may be turned away
from its good usage. "Rather than hasten to demand deeds of charity from
my pupil I prefer to[]{#calibre_link-3381} perform such deeds in his
presence, even depriving him of the means of imitating me, as an honor
beyond his years" *\[Emile*, p. 68\]. "I know that all these imitative
virtues are only the virtues of a monkey, and that a good action is only
morally good when it is done as such and not because others do it. But
at an age when the heart does not yet feel anything, you must make
children copy the deeds[]{#calibre_link-3382} you wish to grow into
habits, until they can do them with understanding and for the love of
what is good" *\[Emile*, p.
68\],^[]{#calibre_link-736}[35](#calibre_link-383){.nounder}^

The possibility of imitation seems thus to interrupt natural simplicity.
With imitation, is it not duplicity that insinuates itself within
presence? And yet, according to a scheme that we have already
identified, Rousseau wished that good imitation should regulate
itself[]{#calibre_link-3383} according to a natural imitation. The taste
for and power of imitation are inscribed within nature. Like pretense,
if they are a corruption *of* imitation, vice and duplicity are not
daughters of but diseases of imitation, are not its natural effect but a
monstrous anomaly. Evil is a result of a sort of perversion of
imitation, of the imitation within imitation. And that evil has a social
origin.

Man imitates, as do the beasts. The love of imitating comes from
well-regulated nature; in society it becomes a vice. The monkey imitates
man, whom he fears, and not the other beasts, which he scorns; he thinks
what is done by his betters []{#calibre_link-1080}must be good. Amongst
us, on the other hand, our harlequins imitate all that is good to
degrade it and bring it into ridicule; knowing their own baseness
they[]{#calibre_link-3385} try to equal what is better than they are, or
if they strive to imitate what they admire, their bad taste appears in
their choice of models, they would rather deceive others or win applause
for their own talents than become wiser or better. *\[Emile*, p. 68\]

Here the relationships among childhood, animality, and man in society
order themselves according to the structure and problematics which
we[]{#calibre_link-3386} had such difficulty in outlining in the
analysis of pity. And it is not by chance: the same paradox---of the
alteration of identity and of identification with the other---is here at
work. Imitation and pity have the same foundation: a sort of
metaphorical ecstacy: "Imitation has its roots in our perpetual desire
to transport ourselves outside of ourselves (ibid.).

Let us return to the *Essay*. The[]{#calibre_link-3387} ruses of
metaphor now appear in the mimetology of all the arts. If art is
imitation, it is essential to remember that everything in it
*signifies*. In the aesthetic experience, we are affected not by things
but by signs:

No one doubts that man is changed by his senses. But instead of
distinguishing the changes, we confuse them with their causes. We attach
too much and too little importance to sensations.[]{#calibre_link-3388}
We do not see that frequently they affect us not merely as sensations,
but as signs or images, and that their moral effects also have moral
causes. Just as the feelings that a painting excites in us are not at
all due to colors, the power of music over our souls is not at all the
work of sounds. Beautiful, subtly shaded colors are a pleasing sight;
but this is purely a pleasure of the sense.[]{#calibre_link-3389} It is
the drawing, the imitation, which gives life and spirit to these colors.
The passions they express are what stir ours; the objects they represent
are what affect us. Colors entail no interest or feeling at all. The
strokes of a touching picture affect us even in a print. Without these
strokes in the picture, the colors would do nothing more (Chap. XIII)
\[p. 53\].

If art operates through[]{#calibre_link-3390} the sign and is effective
through imitation, it can only take place within the system of a
culture, and the theory of art is a theory of mores. A "moral"
impression, contrary to a " 'sensible' impression," is recognized
through the fact that it places its force in a sign. Aesthetics passes
through a semiology and even through an ethnology. The effects of
aesthetic signs are only determined within[]{#calibre_link-3391} a
cultural system. "Unless the influence of sensations upon us is due
mainly to moral causes, why are we so sensitive to impressions that mean
nothing to the uncivilized? Why is our most touching music only a
pointless noise to the ear of a West Indian? Are his nerves of a
different nature from ours?" (Chap. XV) \[*Essay*, p. 59\].

Medicine itself must take account of the semiological culture
within[]{#calibre_link-3392} which it must heal. As with the therapeutic
art, the therapeutic effects of art are not natural in as much as they
work through signs; and if the cure is []{#calibre_link-848}a language,
the remedies must make themselves understood to the sick through the
code of his culture:

The healing of tarantula bites is cited as proof of the physical power
of sounds. But in fact this evidence proves quite the opposite.
What[]{#calibre_link-3393} is needed for curing those bitten by this
insect are neither isolated sounds, nor even the same tunes. Rather,
each needs tunes with familiar melodies and understandable lyrics.
Italian tunes are needed for Italians; for Turks, Turkish tunes. Each is
affected only by accents familiar to him. His nerves yield only to what
his spirit predisposes \[for\] them. One must speak to him in a language
he understands,[]{#calibre_link-3394} if he is to be moved by what he is
told. The cantatas of Bernier are said to have cured the fever of a
French musician. They would have given one to a musician of any other
nation. (Chap. 15) *\[Essay*, p. 60\]

Rousseau does not go so far as to consider that the symptoms themselves
belong to a culture and that the bite of a tarantula might have
different effects in different places. But the
principle[]{#calibre_link-3395} of such a conclusion is clearly
indicated in his explication. There is a single exception, which is more
than simply strange, within this ethno-semiotics: cooking, or rather
taste. Rousseau condemns gluttony without mercy. One might wonder why:
"I know of only one affective sense in which there is no moral element:
that is taste. And, accordingly, gluttony is the main vice only of those
who have[]{#calibre_link-3396} no sense of taste" (ibid.). "Who have no
sense of taste" means here, of course, "who do nothing but taste," who
have nothing but uneducated and uncultivated sensations.

As the value of *virtuality* or potentiality further introduces here an
element of transition and confusion, of graduality and of shifts within
the rigor of distinctions and within the functioning of
concepts---limits of animality,[]{#calibre_link-3397} childhood,
savagery, etc.---one must admit that "moral impressions" through signs
and a system of differences can always be already discerned, although
confusedly, in the animal. "Something of this moral effect is
perceivable even in animals." We realized the need for this hesitation
in connection with pity, and at the same time with imitation:

So long as one insists on considering sounds only[]{#calibre_link-3398}
in terms of the shock that they excite in our nerves, one will not
attain the true principle of music, nor its power over men's hearts. The
sounds of a melody do not affect us merely as sounds, but as signs of
our affections, of our feelings. It is thus that they excite in us the
emotions that they express, whose image we recognize in it. Something of
this moral effect is perceivable even in animals.[]{#calibre_link-3399}
The barking of one dog will attract another. When my cat hears me
imitate a mewing, I see it become immediately attentive, alert,
agitated. When it discovers that I am just counterfeiting the voice of
its species, it relaxes and resumes its rest. Since there is nothing at
all different in the stimulation of the sense organ, and the cat had
initially been deceived, what accounts for the
difference?[]{#calibre_link-3400} (ibid.)

[]{#calibre_link-3401}From this irreducibility of the semiotic order,
Rousseau also draws conclusions against the sensationalism and
materialism of his own century: "Colors and sounds can do much, as
representations and signs, very little simply as objects of sense"
*\[Essay*, p. 61\]. The argument for art as signifying text is at the
service of metaphysics and of spiritualist ethics: "I believe that had
these[]{#calibre_link-3402} ideas been better developed, we should have
been spared many stupid arguments about ancient music. But in this
century when all the operations of the soul have to be materialized, and
even human feeling deprived of all morality, I am deluded if the new
philosophy does not become as destructive of good taste as of virtue"
(ibid.).

We must be attentive to the ultimate finality of the esteem
which[]{#calibre_link-3403} the sign enjoys. According to a general rule
which is important for us, attention to the signifier has the
paradoxical effect of reducing it. Unlike the concept of the supplement
which, of course, *signifies* nothing, simply replaces a lack, the
signifier, as it is indicated in the grammatical form of this word and
the logical form of the concept, signifies a signified. One cannot
separate its effectiveness[]{#calibre_link-3404} from the signified to
which it is tied. It is not the body of the sign that acts, for that is
all sensation, but rather the signified that it expresses, imitates, or
transports. It would be wrong to conclude that, in Rousseau's critique
of sensationalism, it is the sign itself that exhausts the operation of
art. We are moved, "excited," by the represented and not by the
representer, by[]{#calibre_link-3405} the expressed and not by the
expression, by the inside which is exposed and not by the outside of the
exposition. Even in painting, representation comes alive and touches us
only if it imitates an object, and, better, if it expresses a passion:
"It is the drawing, the imitation, which gives life and spirit to these
colors. The passions they express are what stir ours. ... The strokes of
a touching[]{#calibre_link-3406} picture affect us even in a print"
\[*Essay*, p. 53\].

*The engraving:* art being born of imitation, only belongs to the work
proper as far as it can be retained in an engraving, in the reproductive
impression of its *outline*. If the beautiful loses nothing by being
reproduced, if one recognizes it in its sign, in the sign of the sign
which a copy must be, then in the "first time" of its
production[]{#calibre_link-3407} there was already a reproductive
essence. The engraving, which copies the models of art, is nonetheless
the model for art. If the origin of art is the possibility of the
engraving, the death of art and art as death are prescribed from the
very birth of the work. The principle of life, once again, is confounded
with the principle of death. Once again, Rousseau desires to separate
them but once again,[]{#calibre_link-3408} he accedes within his
description and within his text to that which limits or contradicts his
desire.

On the one hand, in fact, Rousseau does not doubt that imitation and
formal outline are the property of art and he inherits, as a matter of
course, the traditional concept of *mimesis;* a concept that was first
that of the philosophers []{#calibre_link-3409}whom Rousseau, one must
remember, accused of having killed[]{#calibre_link-3410} song. This
accusation could not be radical, since it moved within the conceptuality
inherited from this philosophy and of the metaphysical conception of
art. The outline that lends itself to the print or engraving, the line
which *is imitated*, belongs to all the arts, to the arts of space as
much as to the arts of duration, to music no less than to painting. In
both it outlines the space of imitation[]{#calibre_link-3411} and the
imitation of space.

Music is no more the art of combining sounds to please the ear than
painting is the art of combining colors to please the eye. If there were
no more to it than that, they would both be natural sciences rather than
fine arts. Imitation alone raises them to this level. But what makes
painting an imitative art? Drawing. What makes music another? Melody.
(Chap. 13) \[*Essay*[]{#calibre_link-3412}, p. 55\]

The *outline* (design or melodic line) is not only what permits
imitation and the recognition of the represented in the representer. It
is the element of formal difference which permits the contents (colored
or sonorous substance) to appear. By the same token, it cannot *give
rise* to \[literally *provide space* for\] art (techné) as *mimesis*
without constituting it forthwith as a *technique
of[]{#calibre_link-3413} imitation*. If art lives from an originary
reproduction, the outline that permits this reproduction, opens in the
same stroke the space of calculation, of grammaticality, of the rational
science of intervals, and of those "rules of imitation" that are fatal
to energy. Let us recall: "And, to the degree that the rules of
imitation proliferated, imitative language was enfeebled" \[*Essay*, p.
68\]. Imitation[]{#calibre_link-3414} is therefore at the same time the
life and the death of art. Art and death, art and its death are
comprised in the space of the *alteration* of the originary *iteration
(iterum*, anew, does it not come from Sanskrit *itara*, other?); of
repetition, reproduction, representation; or also in space as the
possibility of iteration and the exit from life placed outside of
itself.

For the outline is spacing[]{#calibre_link-3415} itself, and marking
figures, it shapes the surfaces of painting as much as the time of
music:

The role of melody in music is precisely that of drawing in a painting.
This is what constitutes the strokes and figures, of which the harmony
and the sounds are merely the colors. But, it is said, melody is merely
a succession of sounds. No doubt. And drawing is only an arrangement of
colors. An orator[]{#calibre_link-3416} uses ink to write out his
compositions: does that mean ink is a very eloquent liquid? (Chap. 13)
*\[Essay*, p. 53\]

Thus disengaging a concept of formal difference, criticizing with vigor
an aesthetic that one might call substantialist rather than materialist,
more attentive to sensory content than to formal composition, Rousseau
yet places a great deal of the burden of art---here music---upon the
*outline*[]{#calibre_link-3417}. That is to say to what can give rise to
cold calculation and the rules of imitation. According to a logic with
which we are now familiar, Rousseau []{#calibre_link-1031}confronts that
danger *by opposing good form to bad form*, the form of life to the form
of death, *melodic* to *harmonic* form, form with imitative content to
form without content, form full of sense to empty abstraction. *Rousseau
reacts against formalism.[]{#calibre_link-3418} In his eyes formalism is
also a materialism and a sensationalism*.

It is difficult to understand what is at stake in Chapters 13---"On
Melody"---and 14---"On Harmony"---if one does not perceive its immediate
context: the polemic with Rameau. These chapters assemble and stylize a
discussion developed in the corresponding articles of the *Dictionary of
Music* and in the *Examen des deux principes avancés
par[]{#calibre_link-3419} M. Rameau dans sa brochure intitulé* "Erreurs
sur la musique," *dans* l'Encyclopedie" (1755). But this context serves
only to reveal a systematic and permanent necessity.

For Rousseau the difference between the melodic and harmonic form has a
decisive importance. By all the features that distinguish them, they are
opposed, as the life to the death of the song. Yet, if one thinks of the
origin of[]{#calibre_link-3420} the word ("originally a proper name")
and of "the ancient treatises that we have remaining," *"harmony* would
be very difficult to distingiush from melody, unless one adds to the
latter the ideas of ryhthm and measure, without which, in effect, no
melody can have a determined character; whereas *harmony* has its own by
itself, independent of every other quantity" *\[Dictionary*, pp.
286--87\]. The difference[]{#calibre_link-3421} proper to harmony must
thus be looked for in the moderns, for whom it is "a succession of
concords according to the laws of modulation." The principles of this
harmony have been assembled into systems only by the moderns. Examining
that of Rameau, Rousseau reproaches him first for passing off as natural
what is purely conventional: "I ought however to declare, that this
system, as ingenious[]{#calibre_link-3422} as it may appear, is not in
any way founded on nature, as he incessantly repeats it; that it is
established only on analogies and conveniencies, which one, who is
tolerable at invention, might over throw tomorrow, by others much more
natural" (*Dictionary* \[p. 187\]). Rameau's fault is twofold: an
artificialist exuberance and an illusory or abusive recourse to nature,
an excess of arbitrariness which[]{#calibre_link-3423} claims to be
grounded solely in the physics of sound. One cannot deduce a science of
series and intervals from simple physics; Rousseau's argument is
noteworthy in many ways:

The physical principle of the resonance presents to us the solitary
concords and establishes not the succession. A regular succession is
however necessary. A dictionary of chosen words is not an harangue, nor
a collection[]{#calibre_link-3424} of good concords a piece of music. A
*sense is wanting; an union in the music as well as language is
necessary: Something of what precedes must be transmitted to what
follows, that the whole may form a concinnity* \[skillful congruity\]
*and may be truly one*. Moreover, the composed sensation, which results
from a perfect concord, is resolved []{#calibre_link-3425}in the
absolute sensation of each of the sounds which
compose[]{#calibre_link-3426} it; and in the compared sensation of each
of these intervals which these same sounds form between themselves,
*there is nothing beyond the sensible in this concord; from whence it
follows, that it is only by the connection of the sounds, and the
analogy of the intervals, that the union in question can be established:
There lies the true and only principle, whence flow all the laws of
harmony and[]{#calibre_link-3427} modulation*. If then, the whole of
*harmony* was formed only by a succession of perfect major concords, it
would be sufficient to proceed to them by intervals similar to those
which compose such a concord; for then, some sound of the preceding
concord being necessarily prolonged on the following, all the concords
would be found sufficiently united, and the *harmony* would be *one*, at
least, in this[]{#calibre_link-3428} sense. But besides that such
successions would exclude the whole melody, by excluding the diatonic
genus, which forms its bass, they would not reach the true aim of the
art, since *music, being a discourse, ought, like it, to have its
periods, its phrases, suspensions, stops, and punctuation of every
kind;* and as the uniformity of the harmonic courses presents nothing of
these properties, the diatonic[]{#calibre_link-3429} course required the
major and minor concords to be intermixt, and we have felt the necessity
of dissonances to mark the stops and phrases. Moreover, the united
succession of perfect major concords, neither gives the perfect minor
concord, the dissonance, or any kind of phrase, and its punctuation
appears entirely erroneous. Mons. Rameau, insisting absolutely, in his
system, that all our *harmony*[]{#calibre_link-3430} should be drawn
from nature, has had recourse, for this purpose, to another experiment
of his own invention. (Ibid. The author italicizes only the word
*harmony*.)

Rameau's mistake corresponds to the model of all mistakes and all
historical perversions as they *take shape* under Rousseau's eyes:
according to the circle, the ellipse, or the unrepresentable figure of
the movement of history, cold rationality[]{#calibre_link-3431} and
abstract convention there join dead nature, the reign of physicality; a
certain rationalism there mingles with materialism or sensationalism. Or
empiricism: false empiricism, empiricism falsifying the immediate givens
of experience. And this falsification that misleads reason is primarily
a fault of the heart. If Rameau is
mistaken,^[]{#calibre_link-737}[36](#calibre_link-384){.nounder}^ his
errings are moral faults before being theoretical
errors.[]{#calibre_link-3432} One may read in the *Examination:* "I
shall not pretend to avow that the work entitled *Errors on Music* seems
to me in fact to crawl with mistakes, and that I see nothing more just
in it than the title. But those errors are not in M. Rameau's reason;
they have their source nowhere but in the heart: and when passion does
not blind him, he will judge better than anyone the good rules of his
art." The[]{#calibre_link-3433} aberration of the heart which drives him
to persecute^[]{#calibre_link-738}[37](#calibre_link-385){.nounder}^
Rousseau can become a theoretical error only by making him deaf to the
soul of music: melody and not harmony; by making him deaf---a more
serious accusation---as musician as much as musicographer: "I notice in
the *Errors on Music* two of these important principles. The first,
which guided M. []{#calibre_link-1052}Rameau in all his writings, and,
what is worse, in all[]{#calibre_link-3434} his music, is that harmony
is the unique foundation of art, that melody derives from it, and that
all the grand effects of music are born of harmony alone (ibid.)."

Rameau's aberration is a symptom. It betrays the sickness both of the
history of the West and of European ethnocentrism. For harmony according
to Rousseau is a musical perversion that dominates Europe (Northern
Europe) alone, and[]{#calibre_link-3435} ethnocentrism consists of
considering it a natural and universal principle of music. The harmony
that destroys the *energy* of music and shackles its *imitative*
force---melody---is absent in the beginning of music (*in illo tempore*)
and in non-European music (*alibi*). One wonders if Rousseau, conforming
to a schema that we now know well, does not criticize ethnocentrism by a
symmetrical counter-ethnocentrism[]{#calibre_link-3436} and a profound
Western ethnocentrism: notably by claiming that harmony is the evil and
the science proper to
Europe.^[]{#calibre_link-739}[38](#calibre_link-386){.nounder}^

The good form of music, which, through representative imitation,
produces sense while exceeding the senses, would be melody. One must,
according to the same principle of dichotomy which is repeated
endlessly, distinguish within melody itself a principle of life and a
principle[]{#calibre_link-3437} of death, and hold them carefully
separated one from the other. Just as there is a good musical form
(melody) and a bad musical form (harmony), there is a good and a bad
melodic form. By a dichotomous operation that one must ever begin anew
and carry further, Rousseau exhausts himself in trying to separate, as
two exterior and heterogeneous forces, a positive and a negative
principle. Of course,[]{#calibre_link-3438} the malign element in melody
communicates with the malign element of music in general, that is to say
with harmony. This second dissociation between good and bad melodic form
puts the first exteriority into question: there is harmony already
within melody:

*Melody* has reference to two different principles, according to the
manner in which we consider it. Taken in the connection of sounds,
and[]{#calibre_link-3439} by the rules of the mode, *it has its
principle in harmony;* since it is an harmonic analysis which gives the
degrees of the gamut \[scale\], the chords of the mode, and the laws of
the modulation, the only elements of singing. According to this
principle, the whole force of *melody* is bounded to flattering the ear
by agreeable sounds, as one flatters the eye by agreeable concords of
colors; but when[]{#calibre_link-3440} taken as an art of imitation, by
which the mind may be affected with different images, the heart moved by
different sentiments, the passions excited or calmed, in a word, moral
effect be operated, which surpass the immediate empire of the sense,
another principle must be sought for it, for we see no hold, by which
the harmony alone, and whatever comes from it, can affect us thus.
*\[Dictionary*,[]{#calibre_link-3441} p. 227\]

What is there to say about this second principle? It must undoubtedly
permit imitation: imitation alone can *interest* us in art, concern us
by representing nature and by expressing the passions. But what is it
within []{#calibre_link-1081}melody that imitates and expresses? It is
the *accent*. If we have lingered long in the debate with Rameau, it is
also in order to delimit this notion of accent better. It
will[]{#calibre_link-3442} be indispensable for us when we come to it in
the theory of the relationships between speech and writing.

What is this second principle It is *in nature* as well as the first \[I
italicize: Rousseau recognizes that harmony, the principle against
nature, principle of death and of barbarism, is also in nature\], but to
discover it therein, a more nice observation is necessary, tho' more
simple, and[]{#calibre_link-3443} a greater sensibility in the observer.
This principle is the same which makes the tone of the voice vary when
we speak, according to the things we say, and the movements we use in
speaking. It is the *accent* of the language which determines the
*melody* in each nation; it is the *accent* which makes us speak while
singing, and speak with *more or less energy*, according as the language
has more or less[]{#calibre_link-3444} accent. That, whose accent is
most expressed, should produce a *melody* more lively and more
passionate. That which has little or no accent, can have only a cold and
languishing *melody*, without character or expression. Herein are the
true principles. *\[Dictionary*, p. 228\] (Italics added.)

The *Essay*, and notably the three chapters on the origin of music, on
melody, and on harmony, which thus follow[]{#calibre_link-3445} the
order of growth, may be read according to the same pattern. But the
concept of the supplement is this time present in the text, *named* even
though it is never (as it nowhere is) *expounded*. It is indeed this
difference between implication, nominal presence, and thematic
exposition that interests us here.

The chapter on melody proposes the same definitions but it is not
without significance[]{#calibre_link-3446} that the pedagogic
argumentation that introduces them is totally derived from an analogy
with an art of space, painting. The point is first to show by this
example that the science of relations is cold, without imitative energy
(like the calculation of intervals within harmony), while the imitative
expression of meaning (of passion, of the thing as it interests us) is
the true living content of the[]{#calibre_link-3447} work. Let us not be
surprised to see Rousseau place design on the side of art, and colors on
the side of science and the calculation of relationships. The paradox is
apparent. By design, one must understand condition of imitation; by
color, natural substance, whose physical play can be explained by
physical causes and can become the object of a quantitative science of
relationships, of a science[]{#calibre_link-3448} of space and of the
analogical disposition of intervals. The analogy between the two
arts---music and painting---appears thus: *it is analogy itself*. These
two arts carry a corruptive principle, which strangely enough is also in
nature, and in both cases, that corruptive principle is linked to
spacing, to the calculable and analogical regularity of intervals. Thus,
in both cases, whether music or painting,[]{#calibre_link-3449} whether
it is the scales of music or the scales of color, the harmony of tone as
visible or audible nuance, the rational calculation of harmonies
[]{#calibre_link-1042}is a *chromatic*, if one understands that word in
the larger sense, beyond what one specifies with respect to the fact of
the scale and the bass part in music. Rousseau does not use the word in
the *Essay*, but the analogy does not escape him in the
*Dictionary:[]{#calibre_link-3450} "Chromatic*, \[adjective sometimes
taken substantively\]. A kind of music which proceeds in several
consecutive semi-tones. This word is derived from the Greek *chroma*
which signifies color, either because the Greeks marked these notes with
red characters, or differently colored; or, according to authors,
because the chromatic kind is a medium between the two others, as color
is between black and[]{#calibre_link-3451} white; or according to
others, because this kind varies and embellishes the diatonic by its
semi-tones, which, in music, produces the same effect as the colors in
painting" \[p. 61\]. The chromatic, the *scale \[gamme\]*, is to the
origin of art what writing is to speech. (And one will reflect on the
fact that *gamma* is also the name of a Greek letter introduced into the
system of literal musical notation.)[]{#calibre_link-3452} Rousseau
wishes to restore a natural degree of art within which chromatics,
harmonics, and interval would be unknown. He wishes to efface what he
had *furthermore* (and *elsewhere*) already recognized, that there is
harmony within melody, etc. But the *origin must (should) have been*
(such is, here and elsewhere, the grammar and the lexicon of the
relationship to the origin) *pure* melody: "The
first[]{#calibre_link-3453} tales, the first speeches, the first laws,
were in verse. Poetry was devised before prose. That *was bound to be*,
since feelings speak before reason. And so it was bound to be the same
with music. At first, there was no music but melody and no other melody
than the varied sounds of speech. Accents constituted singing." (Italics
added.) \[*Essay*, pp. 50--51\]

But just as in painting the art of design[]{#calibre_link-3454} is
degraded when the physics of color is substituted for
it,^[]{#calibre_link-740}[39](#calibre_link-387){.nounder}^ so in the
song melody is originally corrupted by harmony. Harmony is the originary
supplement of melody. But Rousseau never makes explicit the originarity
of the lack that makes necessary the addition of the supplement---the
quantity and the differences of quantity that always already shape
melody. He does not make it explicit, or rather[]{#calibre_link-3455} he
says it without saying it, in an oblique and clandestine manner. And
reading it, it must be surprised at "this work of contraband," if I may
add a passage from the *Confessions*
here.^[]{#calibre_link-741}[40](#calibre_link-388){.nounder}^ In the
passage of the *Essay* that we have just cited, the definition of the
origin of music was developed in this way, without the contradiction or
the impurity becoming its themes. "Accents constituted
singing,[]{#calibre_link-3456} quantity constituted measure, and one
spoke as much by sounds and rhythm as by articulations and words. To
speak and to sing were formerly one, says Strabo, which shows that in
his opinion poetry is the source of eloquence. *It should be said that
both had the same source*, not that they were initially the same thing.
Considering the way in which the earliest societies were bound together,
is it[]{#calibre_link-3457} surprising that the first stories were in
verse and the first laws were sung? Is []{#calibre_link-1099}it
surprising that the first grammarians suboridnated their art to music
and were professors of both?" \[Italics added; p. 51\]

We shall have to relate these propositions to analogous ones, those of
Vico for example. For the moment I am interested in the logic proper to
Rousseau's discourse: instead of concluding from[]{#calibre_link-3458}
this simultaneity that the song broached itself in grammar, that
difference had already begun to corrupt melody, to make both it and its
laws possible at the same time, Rousseau prefers to believe that grammar
*must (should) have* been comprised, in the sense of being confused
with, within melody. There *must (should) have* been plenitude and not
lack, presence without difference. From then on
the[]{#calibre_link-3459} dangerous supplement, scale or harmony, *adds
itself from the outside as evil and lack* to happy and innocent
plenitude. It would come from an outside which would be simply the
outside. This conforms to the logic of identity and to the principle of
classical ontology (the outside is outside, being is, etc.) but not to
the logic of supplementarity, which would have it that the outside be
inside,[]{#calibre_link-3460} that the other and the lack come to add
themselves as a plus that replaces a minus, that what adds itself to
something takes the place of a default in the thing, that the default,
as the outside of the inside, should be already within the inside, etc.
What Rousseau in fact describes is that the lack, adding itself as a
plus to a plus, cuts into an energy which *must (should) have* been and
remain[]{#calibre_link-3461} intact. And indeed it breaks in as a
dangerous supplement, as a *substitute* that *enfeebles, enslaves,
effaces, separates*, and *falsifies:* "Even if one spent a thousand
years calculating the relations of sounds and the laws of harmony, how
would one ever make of that art an imitative art? Where is the principle
of this supposed imitation? Of what harmony is it the sign? And what do
chords have in[]{#calibre_link-3462} common with our passions? ... But
in the process it also shackles melody, *draining it* of *energy* and
expressiveness. It *wipes out \[efface\] passionate accent, replacing
\[substituer\]* it with the harmonic interval. It is restricted to only
two types of songs, within which its possibilities are determined by the
number of oral tones. It *eliminates \[efface et détruit\]* many sounds
or intervals which do[]{#calibre_link-3463} not fit into its system.
Thus in brief, it *separates* singing from speech, setting these two
languages against each other to their *mutual deprivation of all
authenticity \[vérité\]*, so that it is absurd for them to occur
together in a pathetic subject." (Italics added; yet once again, I
emphasize particularly the strange association of the values of
effacement and substitution) \[*Essay*, pp. 57--58\].

What does Rousseau say without saying, see without seeing? That
substitution has always already begun; that imitation, principle of art,
has always already interrupted natural plenitude; that, having to be a
*discourse*, it has always already broached presence in differance; that
in Nature it is always that which supplies Nature's lack, a voice that
is substituted for the voice of Nature. But he[]{#calibre_link-3465}
says it without drawing any conclusions:

[]{#calibre_link-3468}[]{#calibre_link-3469}By itself, harmony is
insufficient even for those expressions that seem to depend uniquely on
it. Thunder, murmuring waters, winds, tempests, are but poorly rendered
by simple chords. Whatever one does, noise alone does not speak to the
spirit at all. The objects must speak in order to be understood. *In all
imitation, some form of discourse must substitute for the voice of
nature*. The musician[]{#calibre_link-3470} who would represent noise by
noise deceives himself. *He knows nothing of either the weakness or the
strength of his art*, concerning which his judgment is tasteless and
unenlightened. Let him realize that he will have to render noise in
song; that to produce the croaking of frogs, he will have to have them
sing. *For it is not enough to imitate them;* he must do so touchingly
and pleasantly. Otherwise,[]{#calibre_link-3471} his tedious imitation
is nothing, and will neither interest nor impress anyone. (Italics

[]{#calibre_link-39}***The Turn of
Writing.[]{#calibre_link-1183}[\*](#calibre_link-390){.nounder}*** We
are thus brought back to discourse as supplement. And to the structure
of the *Essay* (origin of langauge, origin and degeneracy of music,
degeneracy of language) which reflects the structure of language not
only in its becoming but also in its space, in its
disposition,[]{#calibre_link-3472} in what may literally be called its
*geography*.

Language is a *structure---a* system of oppositions of places and
values---and an *oriented* structure. Let us rather say, only half in
jest, that *its orientation is a disorientation*. One will be able to
call it a *polarization*. Orientation gives direction to movement by
relating it to its origin as to its dawning. And it is starting from the
light of origin[]{#calibre_link-3473} that one thinks of the West, the
end and the fall, cadence or check, death or night. According to
Rousseau, who appropriates here a most banal opposition from the
seventeenth
century,^[]{#calibre_link-742}[41](#calibre_link-391){.nounder}^
language *turns*, so to speak, as the earth turns. Here neither the
orient nor the occident is privileged. The references are to the
extremities of the axis around which the globe *turns (polos, polein*)
and which[]{#calibre_link-3474} is called the *rational* axis: the South
Pole and the North Pole.

There will be neither an historical line nor an immobile picture of
languages. There will be a *turn* (trope) of language. And this movement
of culture will be both ordered and rhythmed according to the most
natural thing in nature: the earth and the seasons. Languages are
*sown*. And they themselves pass from one season to
another.[]{#calibre_link-3475} The division between languages, the
apportionment in the formation of languages, between the systems turned
toward the North and the systems turned toward the Souththat interior
limit---already leaves its furrow in language in general and each
language in particular. Such at least is our interpretation. Rousseau
*would wish* the opposition between southern and northern in order to
place a natural[]{#calibre_link-3476} frontier between different types
of languages. However, what he *describes* forbids us to think it. That
description shows that the []{#calibre_link-3477}opposition north/south
being rational and not natural, structural and not factual, relational
and not substantial, traces an axis of reference *inside* each language.
No language is from the south or the north, no real element of the
language has an absolute situation,[]{#calibre_link-3478} only a
differential one. That is why the polar opposition does not divide a set
of already existing languages; it is described, though not declared, by
Rousseau to be the origin of languages. We must measure this gap between
the description and the declaration.

What I shall loosely call the polarization of languages repeats within
each linguistic system the opposition that permits us to
think[]{#calibre_link-3479} the emergence of language from nonlanguage:
the opposition of passion and need and the entire series of connotative
significations. Whether from north or south, all language in general
springs forth when passionate desire exceeds physical need, when
imagination *is awakened*, which awakens pity and gives movement to the
supplementary chain. But once languages are constituted, the polarity
need/passion,[]{#calibre_link-3480} and the entire supplementary
structure, remain operative within each linguistic system: languages are
more or less close to pure passion, that is to say more or less distant
from pure need, more or less close to pure language or pure nonlanguage.
And the measure of that proximity furnishes the structural principle of
a classification of languages. Thus the languages of the north are *on
the whole*[]{#calibre_link-3481} languages of need, the languages of the
south, to which Rousseau devotes ten times the space in his description,
are *on the whole* languages of passion. But this *description* does not
prevent Rousseau from *declaring* that the one group is born of passion,
the other of need: the one group expresses *first* passion, the other
expresses *first* need. In southern countries, the first discourses were
songs[]{#calibre_link-3482} of love, in northern countries "the first
words ... were not *love me \[aimezmoi\]* but *help me \[aidez-moi\]."*
If one took this declaration literally, one would have to judge it
contradictory both to the descriptions and to other declarations:
notably to that which excludes the possibility of a language arising out
of pure need. But in order to be not merely apparent, these
contradictions are regulated[]{#calibre_link-3483} by the desire of
considering the functional or polar origin as the real and natural
origin. Not being able simply to accept the fact that the concept of
origin has merely a relative function within a system situating a
multitude of origins in itself, each origin capable of being the effect
or the offshoot of another origin, the north capable of becoming the
south for a more northern site, etc.,[]{#calibre_link-3484} Rousseau
would like the absolute origin to be an absolute south. It is in terms
of this diagram that the questions of fact and principle, of real and
ideal origin, of genesis and structure in Rousseau's discourse must be
asked anew. The diagram is undoubtedly more complex than one generally
thinks.

One must here take into account the following necessities: the south is
the place of origin or[]{#calibre_link-3485} the cradle of languages.
Thus the southern languages []{#calibre_link-3486}are closer to
childhood, nonlanguage, and nature. But at the same time, being closer
to the origin, they are purer, more alive, more animated. On the other
hand, the northern languages are distant from the origin, less pure,
less alive, less warm. In them one can follow the progress of death and
coldness. But even here, the fact that this
distance[]{#calibre_link-3487} takes us closer to the origin is not
representable. The northern languages lead back to that need, to that
physicality, to that nature to which the southern languages, which had
just left it, were in the closest possible proximity. It is always the
impossible design, the unbelievable line of the supplementary structure.
Although the difference between south and north, passion and need,
explains[]{#calibre_link-3488} the origin of languages, it persists in
the constitued languages, and at the extreme, the north amounts to the
south of the south, which puts the south to the north of the north.
Passion animates need more or less, and from the inside. Need constrains
passion more or less, and from the inside. This polar difference should
rigorously prevent the distinction of two series simply exterior to
one[]{#calibre_link-3489} another. But one now knows why Rousseau was
anxious to maintain that impossible exteriority. His text moves, then,
between what we have called *description* and *declaration*, which are
themselves structural poles rather than natural and fixed points of
reference.

According to the pressing force of need persisting in passion, we shall
have different types of passion and therefore different
types[]{#calibre_link-3490} of languages. The pressure of need varies
with place. Place is at the same time geographical situation and
seasonal period. Since the difference in the pressure of needs depends
upon a local difference, one will not be able to distinguish the
question of the morphological classification of languages, which takes
into account the effects of need on the form of a language, from the
question of the place[]{#calibre_link-3491} of origin of the language,
*typology* from *topology*. One must consider *together* the origin of
languages and the difference among languages. Such that, continuing our
reflection on the organization of the Essay, we see Rousseau approaching
this double question as one and the same question; and doing so after
having spoken of the definition of language in general or of primitive
languages in general.[]{#calibre_link-3492} Chapter 8, "General and
Local Difference in the Origin of Languages," presents itself thus: "All
that I have said so far applies to primitive tongues in general, and to
such development as is due merely to the passage of time. But it does
not explain either their origin or their differences" \[p. 30\].

How does the place of origin of a language immediately mark the
difference proper to the language?[]{#calibre_link-3493} What is here
the privilege of the place? The locale signifies first the nature of the
soil and of the climate: "The principal cause that distinguishes them is
local, deriving from the various climates in which they are born, and
the way in which they take form. It is necessary to go back to this
cause in order to understand the general and characteristic differences
between the tongues of the[]{#calibre_link-3494} south and those of
[]{#calibre_link-866}the north" *\[Essay*, p. 30\]. A proposition which
conforms to the promise that opens the *Essay:* one must furnish a
*natural*, nonmetaphysical, nontheological explanation of the origin of
languages:

Speech distinguishes man among the animals; language distinguishes
nations from each other; one does not know where a man comes from until
he has spoken. Out of usage and necessity, each[]{#calibre_link-3495}
learns the language of his own country. But what determines that this
language is that of his country and not of another? In order to tell, it
is necessary to go back to some principle that belongs to the locality
itself and antedates its customs, for speech, being the first social
institution, owes its form to natural causes alone \[p. 5\].

To return to these natural causes is, then, to
avoid[]{#calibre_link-3496} the theologico-moral *usteron proteron*,
that of Condillac for example. One knows that in the second *Discourse*,
Rousseau, while recognizing his debt fully, still reproaches Condillac
for allowing himself mores and a society to explain the origin of
languages, especially at the moment when he professes to give a purely
natural explanation of what nevertheless remains in his eyes a gift of
God. Rousseau[]{#calibre_link-3497} regrets that Condillac supposes
precisely that which one must question from the beginning, namely "a
sort of society already established among the inventors of language." It
is "the blunder made by those who, in reasoning on the state of nature,
always import into it ideas gathered in a state of society"
*\[Discourse*, pp. 174--75\]. On this point also, the *Essay* agrees
with the *Discourse*. There is[]{#calibre_link-3498} no social
institution before language, it is not one cultural element among
others, it is the element of institutions in general, it includes and
constructs the entire social structure. Since nothing precedes it in
society, its cause can only be precultural or natural. Although its
essence is in the passions, its cause, which is not its essence, arises
out of nature, that is to say from need. And[]{#calibre_link-3499} if
one wants to find a precise point of juncture between the second
*Discourse* and the four chapters of the *Essay* dealing with the origin
and the differences of languages, notably in that factual content from
which we have drawn the argument, one should reread, in Part One of the
*Discourse*, the page on the relationships between instincts and
society, between passion and need, north and south.
There[]{#calibre_link-3500} one would see (1) that supplementarity is
the structural rule ("Savage man, left by nature solely to the direction
of instinct, *or rather indemnified for what he may lack by faculties
capable at first of supplying its place, and afterwards of raising him
much above it*, must accordingly begin with purely animal functions"
(italics added) \[p. 171\]; (2) that in spite of the essential
heterogeneity[]{#calibre_link-3501} of passion and need, the former is
added to the latter as an effect to a cause, a product to an origin:
"Whatever moralists may hold, the human understanding is greatly
indebted to the passions. ... The passions, again, originate in our
wants" *\[Discourse*, p. 171\]; (3) that Rousseau then *makes room* for
a geographical []{#calibre_link-1008}explanation: a structural
explanation which he says can be sustained by facts;
and[]{#calibre_link-3502} that this explanation amounts to a difference
between the peoples of the north and those of the south, the former
receiving a supplement to fulfill a lack that the latter do not suffer.
And when [Chapter 8](#calibre_link-51){.nounder} of the *Essay*
announces its considerations of the differences in this way: "Let us try
to follow the order of nature in our investigations. I shall enter now
upon a long digression on a subject[]{#calibre_link-3503} so hackneyed
it is trivial, but one to which it is nonetheless always necessary to
return, in order to find the origin of human institutions" \[p. 31\],
one can imagine the placing of a long footnote to this passage of the
*Discourse* (Rousseau is explaining that "the passions in their turn
draw their origin from our needs"):

It would be easy, were it necessary, to support this opinion by
facts,[]{#calibre_link-3504} and to show that, in all the nations of the
world, the progress of the understanding has been exactly proportionate
to the wants which the peoples had received from nature, or been
subjected to by circumstances, and in consequence to the passions that
induced them to provide for those necessities. I might instance the
arts, rising up in Egypt and expanding with the inundation of the Nile.
I might[]{#calibre_link-3505} follow their progress into Greece, where
they took root afresh, grew up and towered to the skies, among the rocks
and sands of Attica, without being able to germinate on the fertile
banks of the Eurotas: I might observe that in general, the people of the
North are more industrious than those of the South, because they cannot
get on so well without being so: *as if nature wanted to equalize
matters[]{#calibre_link-3506} by giving their understandings the
fertility she had refused to their soil* (pp. 143--44 *\[171--72\];*
italics added).

There is, then, an economy of nature which attends to the regulating of
faculties according to needs, and distributes supplements and
compensations. This supposes that the sphere of necessity is itself
complex, hierarchized, differentiated. It is in this sense that we
should relate[]{#calibre_link-3507} to all such texts [Chapter
8](#calibre_link-51){.nounder} of Book III of *The Social
Contract;*[]{#calibre_link-1185}[\*](#calibre_link-392){.nounder} the
influence of *De l'esprit des*
Loix^[]{#calibre_link-1186}[†](#calibre_link-393){.nounder}^ upon the
chapter has been noticed; an entire theory of the *excess* of the
production of work according to need systematically dovetails with a
typology of the forms of government (according to "the distance between
people and government") and with an explanation by climate (according to
whether[]{#calibre_link-3508} one goes away from or "nearer ... to the
equator"): "We find then, in every climate, natural causes according to
which the form of government which it requires can be assigned, and we
can even say what sort of inhabitants it should have" *\[Social
Contract*, p. 65\].

[]{#calibre_link-1073}But the theory of needs that underlies the *Essay*
is set forth, perhaps better than elsewhere, in a fragment of five
pages, whose inspiration[]{#calibre_link-3509} is undeniably that of the
chapters that interest us and undoubtedly also that of the project of
the *Political
Institutions.^[]{#calibre_link-743}[42](#calibre_link-394){.nounder}^*
Three sorts of needs are distinguished there: those that "deal with
subsistence" and "with preservation" (nourishment, sleep); those that
deal with "well-being," which are "properly speaking no more than
appetites, but sometimes so violent that they torment more than
true[]{#calibre_link-3510} needs" ("luxury of sensuality, of softness,
the union of sexes and all that flatter our senses"): "a third order of
needs which, born after the others, do not allow them to take
precedence, are those that arise from public opinion." The first two
must be satisfied for the last to appear, Rousseau notes, but we have
observed that *the second or secondary need supplants each time, by
force or urgency,[]{#calibre_link-3511} the first need. There is already
a perversion of needs, an inversion of their natural order*. And we have
just seen included among needs what is elsewhere named passion. Need is
thus permanently present within passion. But if one wants to be aware of
the first origin of passion, society, and language, one must return to
the profundity of the needs of the first order. Our fragment thus
defines the[]{#calibre_link-3512} program of the *Essay*, which it
proceeds to flesh out in a few pages:

Thus all reduces itself at first to subsistence, and in that respect man
is a function of his environment. He depends on everything and he
becomes what everything he depends upon forces him to be. Climate, soil,
air, water, productions of the earth and sea, form his temperament, his
character, determine his tastes, his passions,[]{#calibre_link-3513} his
work, his actions of all kinds. \[The natural explanation is not good
for the atoms of culture but for the total social fact:\] If that is not
exactly true of individuals, it is undeniably true of peoples. ... Thus
before one broaches the history of our species, one must begin by
examining its habitation and all its varieties (p. 530).

The explanation by the natural locale is not a static
one.[]{#calibre_link-3514} It takes into account the natural
revolutions: seasons and migrations. Rousseau's dynamic is a strange
system within which the critique of ethnocentrism organically comes to
terms with a Europeocentrism. It is better understood by carefully
weaving together a piece of *Emile* and a piece of the *Essay*. It is
then seen how the concept of *culture*, in a very rare usage, unites
nature and society by[]{#calibre_link-3515} virtue of its metaphoricity.
In the *Essay* as in *Emile*, the changes of place and seasons, the
displacements of man and terrestrial revolutions are taken care of by
the natural explanation. But if that explanation is preceded, in the
*Essay*, by a protestation against European prejudice, it is followed,
in *Emile*, by a Europeocentric profession of faith. As the protestation
and the profession of faith[]{#calibre_link-3516} have not the same
function and are not on the same level, and as they do not contradict
each other, we []{#calibre_link-3517}will profit by recomposing their
system. Let us first place the texts side by side:

The *Essay*:

The great shortcoming of Europeans is always to philosophize on the
origins of things exclusively in terms of what happens within their own
milieu. They never fail to show us primitive men
inhabiting[]{#calibre_link-3518} a barren and harsh world, dying of cold
and hunger, desperate for shelter and clothing, with nothing in sight
but Europe's ice and snow. But they fail to realize that, just like all
life, the human race originated in warm climes, and that on two-thirds
of the globe, winter is hardly known. When one wants to study men, one
must consider those around one. But to study man, one must extend the
range[]{#calibre_link-3519} of one's vision. One must first observe the
differences in order to discover the properties. The human race, born in
warm lands, spread itself into cold areas where it multiplied, and then
coursed back into the warm lands. From this action and reaction come the
revolutions of the earth and the continual agitation of its inhabitants
(Chap. 8) \[pp. 30--31\].

*Emile:*

The birthplace is not a matter[]{#calibre_link-3520} of indifference in
the *education \[culture\]* of man; *it is only in temperate climes that
he comes to his full growth*. The disadvantages of extremes are easily
seen. A *man is not planted in one place like a tree, to stay there the
rest of his life*, and to pass from one extreme to another you must
travel twice as far as he who starts half-way. ... A Frenchman can live
in New Guinea or in Lapland, but[]{#calibre_link-3521} a negro cannot
live in Tornea nor a Samoyed in Benin. It seems also as if the brain
were less perfectly organized in the two extremes. Neither the negroes
nor the Laps are as wise as Europeans. So if I want my pupil to be a
citizen of the world I will choose him in the temperate zone, in France
for example, rather than elsewhere.\
In the north with its barren soil men devour much food, in the
fertile[]{#calibre_link-3522} south they eat little. This produces
another difference: the one is industrious, the other contemplative (p.
27; italics added) \[p. 20\].

How do these two apparently contradictory texts complement each other?
We shall see below how culture is linked to agriculture. It appears here
that man, in as much as he depends upon a soil and a climate, *is
cultivated:* he sprouts, he forms a society and
"The[]{#calibre_link-3523} birthplace is not a matter of indifference in
the education *\[culture\]* of man." But this culture is also the power
of changing terrain, of opening oneself to another culture: man may look
far, "he is not planted in one place like a tree," he is engaged, both
texts say, in migrations and revolutions. From that perspective, one may
criticize ethnocentrism in as much as it shuts us in within a
locality[]{#calibre_link-3524} and an empirical culture: the European
makes the mistake of not traveling, of deeming himself the immobile
center of the world, of resting planted like a tree in his own country.
But this criticism of the empirical Europe should not prevent us from
recognizing, Rousseau seems to think, that []{#calibre_link-1058}the
European, by his natural locality, occupying the middle between
extremes, has a greater facility for[]{#calibre_link-3525} traveling,
for opening himself to the horizon and diversity of universal culture.
At the center of the world, the European has the luck or power to be
European and everything else at the same time. ("It is only in temperate
climates that he \[man\] comes to his full growth---") He is simply
wrong in not using this universal opening *in fact*.

All this argumentation circulates between the two
Europes;[]{#calibre_link-3526} it has remained or become classic. We
shall not examine it here for its own sake: let us only consider that it
is the condition of all Rousseau's discourse. If, in his eyes, there
were no unlocking of a determined culture, no opening into all other
cultures in general, no mobility and possibility of imaginary
variations, these questions would remain closed. Better, it would be
impossible to determine[]{#calibre_link-3527} difference. Difference
only appears starting from a certain middle point, a certain median,
mobile and temperate, between north and south, need and passion,
consonant and accent, etc. Under the factual determination of this
temperate zone (Europe, "in France, for example, rather than
elsewhere"), birthplace of the anthropologist and of the citizen of the
world, an essential necessity is concealed:[]{#calibre_link-3528} it is
*between* different things that one can think difference. But this
difference-between may be understood in two ways: as another difference
or as access to nondifference. It is not at all doubtful for Rousseau
that the inhabitant of the temperate zone *should* make of his
difference, effacing it or surmounting it in an interested
in-difference, an opening to the humanity of man. Pedagogical
success[]{#calibre_link-3529} and ethnological humanism would have the
good fortune of producing itself in Europe, "in France, for example,
rather than elsewhere," in that happy region of the world where man is
neither warm nor cold.

From this privileged place of observation, one will better dominate the
play of oppositions, order, and the predominance of extremes. One will
better understand the natural causes of culture.[]{#calibre_link-3530}
Since language is not an element but the element of culture, one must
first locate, both in the language and in nature, the oppositions of
corresponding and interarticulated values. What, within language, must
correspond to the predominance of need, that is to say the north?
Consonant or articulation. To the predominance of passion, that is to
say of the south? Accent or inflection.

The play[]{#calibre_link-3531} of predominances would be inexplicable if
one held to the simple proposition according to which languages are born
of passion ([Chapter 3](#calibre_link-239){.nounder}). In order that
need may come to dominate passion in the north, an inversion or
perversion must already be possible within the order of need and of a
need that is forever related to passion, arousing it, persevering in it,
submitting to it or controlling it.[]{#calibre_link-3532} The appeal to
the second *Discourse* and to the *Fragment* was thus indispensable. It
permits us to explain this affirmation of the *Essay*: "Eventually all
men became similar, but the order []{#calibre_link-3533}of their
progress is different. In southern climes, where nature is bountiful,
needs are born of passion. In cold countries, where she is miserly,
passions are born of need, and the languages, sad daughters of
necessity,[]{#calibre_link-3534} reflect their austere origin" (Chap.
10) \[*Essay*, p. 46\].

Now if the predominance of the North Pole over the South, of need over
passion, of articulation over accent, is in fact *gradual*, it
nonetheless has the sense of *substitution*. As we have often shown,
progressive effacement is also the installation of a supplementary
substitute. The man of the North substituted *help-me \[aidez-moi\]* for
*love-me[]{#calibre_link-3535} \[aimez-moi\]*, clarity for energy,
articulation for accent, reason for heart. Formal substitution
undoubtedly conveys a weakening of energy, of warmth, of life, of
passion, but it remains a transformation, a revolution in form and not
only a diminishing of force. An explanation of this substitution in
terms of a simple degradation is most inadequate; it so strongly implies
a displacement and an[]{#calibre_link-3536} inversion that it refers us
to a completely different function of need. In the *normal* order of
origin (in the South), the proposition of [Chapter
2](#calibre_link-14){.nounder} (*That the first invention of speech is
due not to need but to passions* and "the natural effect of the first
needs was to separate men, and not to reunite them") has an absolutely
general value. But this normal order of origin is reversed in the
North.[]{#calibre_link-3537} The North is not simply the distanced other
of the South, it is not the limit that one reaches if he starts out from
the unique southern origin. Rousseau is in a way compelled to recognize
that the North is also *another origin*. It is to death that he accords
this status, because the absolute North is death. Normally need isolates
men instead of bringing them closer; in the North, it is the
origin[]{#calibre_link-3538} of society:

The idleness that nurtures passion *is replaced by work, which represses
it*. Before being concerned with living happily, one had to be concerned
with living. Mutual need uniting men to a greater extent when sentiment
has not done so, society would be formed only through industry. The
ever-present danger of perishing would not permit a language restricted
to gesture. And, the first[]{#calibre_link-3539} words among them were
not *love me \[aimez-moi\]* but *help me \[aidez-moi\]*.\
These two expressions, although similar enough, are pronounced in a very
*different* tone. The whole point was not to make someone *feel*
something, but to make him *understand*. Thus what was needed was not
*vigor \[énergie\]* but *clarity*. For the *accents* which the heart
does not provide, distinct *articulation* is *substituted*. And
if[]{#calibre_link-3540} some trace of nature remains in the form of the
language, this too contributes to its austerity. (Italics added.)

In the north, the passions do not disappear: there is substitution, not
effacement. The passions are not extenuated but *repressed* by what
takes the place of desire: work. Work represses more than it lessens the
force of desire. It displaces it. That is why "Northern men are not
passionless,[]{#calibre_link-3541} but []{#calibre_link-3542}their
passions are, in effect, of another kind" \[*Essay*, p. 48\]: anger,
irritation, fury, disquietude are the displacements of southern passion.
In the south, passion is not repressed, whence a certain softness, a
certain intemperance for which people in tempered regions do not have an
unreserved indulgence:

The passions of the warm countries are voluptuous, relating to love and
tenderness.[]{#calibre_link-3543} Nature does so much for people there
that they have almost nothing to do. Provided that an Asiatic has women
and repose, he is contented. But in the north, where people consume a
great deal, on barren soil, men are easily irritated, being subject to
so many needs. Anything happening near them disturbs them. As they
subsist only through effort, the poorer they are the more firmly they
hold to the[]{#calibre_link-3544} little they have. To approach them is
to threaten their lives. This is what accounts for their irascible
temper, their quickness to attack anyone who offends them. Thus too
their most natural tone of voice is angry and menacing, and their words
are always accompanied by *emphatic articulation*, which makes them
harsh and loud. ... These, in my opinion are the most general physical
causes of the characteristic[]{#calibre_link-3545} differences of the
primitive tongues. Those of the south are bound to be *lively, sonorous,
accented, eloquent*, and frequently *obscure because' of their power*.
Those of the north are bound to be *dull, harsh, articulated, shrill,
monotonous*, and to have a *clarity due more to vocabulary than to good
construction*. The modern tongues, with all their intermingling and
recasting, still retain something[]{#calibre_link-3546} of these
differences. (Chap. 10, 11. Italics added.) \[pp. 48--49\]

The pole of linguistic articulation is in the north. Articulation
(difference within language) is thus not a simple effacement; it does
not tone down the energy either of desire or of the accent. It displaces
and represses desire by work. It is not the sign of a weakening of
force, in spite of what Rousseau sometimes seems to
make[]{#calibre_link-3547} us think, but it conveys, on the contrary, a
conflict of antagonistic forces, a difference within the force. The
force of need, its own economy, that which makes work necessary, works
precisely against the force of desire and represses it, breaking its
song into articulation.

This conflict of forces responds to an economy that is no longer simply
that of need, but the system of the relations[]{#calibre_link-3548} of
force between desire and need. Here two forces that one may
indifferently consider forces of life or of death are opposed.
Responding to the urgency of need, the man of the north protects his
life not only against penury but against the death that would follow the
unrestrained liberation of southern desire. He protects himself against
the menace of voluptuousness. But conversely, he fights
against[]{#calibre_link-3549} this force of death with another force of
death. From this point of view, it appears that life, energy, desire,
etc., are of the South. The northern language is less alive, less
animated, less song-like, colder. To fight against
[]{#calibre_link-802}death, the man of the North dies a little earlier
and "it is known ... that northern peoples do not die singing any more
than swans do" (Chap. 14) \[p. 58\].

Writing is at[]{#calibre_link-3550} the North: cold, necessitous,
reasoning, turned toward death, to be sure, but by that *tour de force*,
by that detour of force which forces it to hold on to life. In fact, the
more a language is articulated, the more articulation extends its
domain, and thus gains in rigor and in vigor, the more it yields to
writing, the more it calls writing forth. This is the central thesis of
the *Essay*. The progress[]{#calibre_link-3551} of history, the
degradation which unites with it according to the strange graphic of
supplementarity, goes toward the North and toward death: history effaces
vowel accent, or rather represses it, hollows out articulation, extends
the power of writing. That is why the ravages of writing are more felt
in the modern languages:

The modern tongues, with all their intermingling and recasting,
still[]{#calibre_link-3552} retain something of these differences.
French, English, German: each is a language private to a group of men
who help each other, reason together calmly, or who become angry. But
the ministers of the gods proclaiming sacred mysteries, sages giving
laws to their people, leaders swaying the multitude, have to speak
Arabic or
Persian.^[]{#calibre_link-744}[43](#calibre_link-395){.nounder}^ *Our
tongues are better suited to writing than speaking*,
and[]{#calibre_link-3553} there is more pleasure in reading us than in
listening to us. Oriental tongues, on the other hand, lose their life
and warmth when they are written. The words do not convey half the
meaning: all the effectiveness is in the tone of voice *\[accents*).
Judging the genius of the Orientals from their books is like painting a
man's portrait from his corpse (Chap. 11; italics added) \[p. 49\].

The oriental[]{#calibre_link-3554} corpse is in the book. Ours is
already in our speech. Our language, even if we are pleased to speak it,
has already substituted too many articulations for too many accents, it
has lost life and warmth, it is already eaten by writing. Its
accentuated features have been gnawed through by the consonants.

Although it was not the only degree of articulation for Rousseau, the
fragmentation of language[]{#calibre_link-3555} into words had already
cancelled the energy of the accent (by using that verb---"to cancel"
*\[biffer\]*---we leave the values of effacement and erasure, of
extenuation and repression, in their ambiguity, as Rousseau proposes
them simultaneously). The languages of the North are "clear because of
the power of words"; in the languages of the South, "the meaning is only
half in the words, all the force is[]{#calibre_link-3556} in the
accents."

Cancellation amounts to producing a supplement. But as always, the
supplement is incomplete, unequal to the task, it lacks something in
order for the lack to be filled, it participates in the evil that it
should repair. The loss of accent is inadequately compensated for by
articulation: the latter is "strong," "hard," and "noisy," it does not
sing. And when writing tries to supplement[]{#calibre_link-3557} accent
by accents, it is nothing but make-up dissimulating the corpse of the
accent. Writing---here the inscribing of accents---not only
[]{#calibre_link-887}hides language under its artifice, it masks the
already decomposed corpse of language. "We \[moderns\] have no idea of a
sonorous and harmonious language, spoken as much according to sounds as
it is according to words. It is mistaken to think that accent marks can
*[]{#calibre_link-3558}make up for \[suppléer\]* oral intonation
*\[l'accent\]*. One invents accent signs *\[accens\]* only when
intonation *\[l'accent\]* has already been
lost"^[]{#calibre_link-745}[44](#calibre_link-396){.nounder}^ (Chap. 7;
italics added) \[*Essay*, pp. 24--25\]. Accents are, like punctuation,
an evil of writing: not only an invention of *copyists* but of copyists
who are *strangers* to the language which they transcribe; the copyist
or his reader is by definition a stranger[]{#calibre_link-3559} to the
living use of language. They always deal with a moribund speech in order
to camouflage it: "When the Romans began to study Greek, the copyists
invented signs for accent marks, aspiration marks, and marks of prosody,
to indicate their pronunciation. But by no means does it follow that
these signs were in use among the Greeks, who would not need them"
\[*Essay*, pp. 29--30 n.\]. For obvious reasons,[]{#calibre_link-3560}
Rousseau was of necessity fascinated by the person of the copyist.
Especially but not only within the musical order, the moment of
transcription is the dangerous moment, as is the moment of writing,
which in a way is already a transcription, the imitation of other signs;
reproducing the signs, producing the signs of signs, the copyist is
always tempted to add *supplementary* signs to improve
the[]{#calibre_link-3561} restitution of the original. The good copyist
must resist the temptation of the supplementary sign. He must rather
show himself economical in the use of signs. In the admirable article
"copyist" in the *Dictionary of Music*, with the minuteness and
volubility of an artisan explaining his craft to the apprentice,
Rousseau advises "never to write useless notes," "not to multiply signs
in a useless[]{#calibre_link-3562}
way."^[]{#calibre_link-746}[45](#calibre_link-397){.nounder}^

Punctuation is the best example of a nonphonetic mark within writing.
Its impotence in transcribing accent and inflexion isolates or analyses
the misery of writing reduced to its proper means. Unlike
Duclos,^[]{#calibre_link-747}[46](#calibre_link-398){.nounder}^ who yet
inspires him, here Rousseau accuses, rather than the essence of
punctuation, the imperfect state in which it has been left: a vocative
mark must be invented to "distingiush[]{#calibre_link-3563} a man named
from a man called." And even a mark of irony. For while distrusting
writing, and indeed because of that distrust, Rousseau wants to exhaust
all its univocity, clarity, precision. These values are negative when
they chill the expression of passion; but they are positive when they
avoid trouble, ambiguity, hypocrisy, and the dissimulation of the
original spoken word or song. The *Dictionary[]{#calibre_link-3564} of
Music* recommends "exactness of the connections" and "a neatness in our
signs" (article on copyist) *\[copiste;* p. 96\].

The difference between accent or intonation on the one hand and accents
on the other thus separates speech and writing as quality and quantity,
force and spacing. "Our professed accents are nothing but vowels, or
signs of quantity; they mark no variety of sound." Quantity
is[]{#calibre_link-3565} linked to articulation.
[]{#calibre_link-1006}Here to the articulation into sounds and not, as
immediately above, to articulation into words. Rousseau is aware of what
André Martinet calls the *double articulation* of language: into sounds
and into words. The opposition of "vowels" or "voice" to accent or
"diversity of sounds" evidently presupposes that the vowel is not pure
voice, but a voice that has already undergone[]{#calibre_link-3566} the
differential work of articulation. Voice and vowel are not opposed here,
to the consonant, as they are in another context.

The entire [Chapter 7](#calibre_link-399){.nounder}, "On Modern
Prosody," which criticizes French grammarians and plays a decisive role
in the *Essay*, is strongly inspired by Duclos. The borrowings are
declared, massive, determining. Given the architectonic importance of
this chapter, it is difficult[]{#calibre_link-3567} to believe that the
borrowings from Duclos were inserted after the fact.

But, furthermore, is it a matter of borrowing? As usual, Rousseau makes
the borrowed pieces play within an absolutely original organization. Of
course he cites and recites such and such a passage from the
"Commentary" ([Chapter 4](#calibre_link-288){.nounder}) here and there.
Even when he is not actually quoting, he draws from passages like the
following,[]{#calibre_link-3568} which, with many others, would
anticipate a similar Saussurian development (supra, p. 57, 38--39).

The superstition of etymology gives rise to as many inconsistencies in
its small domain, as superstition properly speaking does in graver
matters. Our orthography is an assemblage of bizarrerie and
contradictions. ... Yet, whatever care one took in noting our prosody,
beside the unpleasantness of seeing[]{#calibre_link-3569} print
bristling with signs, I have strong doubts that that would be of much
use. There are things which can only be learnt through usage; they are
purely organic and give so little foothold to reason, that it would be
impossible to grasp them by theory alone, which is faulty even in the
authors who expressly deal with them. I sense even that what I write
here is very difficult to make comprehensible,[]{#calibre_link-3570} and
that it would be very clear, if I explained it in my person (pp.
414--15).

But Rousseau keeps an eye on his borrowings, reinterprets them, and
applies himself to enhancing their value in a manner to which we must
pay heed. He insists, for example, upon the notion that the accent is
*cancelled* by the sign and the use of the spoken word by the artifice
of writing. Cancelled by a work of erasure[]{#calibre_link-3571} and
replacement, obliterated rather than forgotten, toned down, devalued.
"According to M. Duclos, 'all the ancient prosodic signs supposed a
quite fixed function, not yet bowing to usage.' I would add that they
substituted for it" \[*Essay*, p. 27\]. And Rousseau's entire argument
follows the history of the accentuation or of the punctuation superadded
to the primitive Hebraic language.

The conflict[]{#calibre_link-3572} then is between the force of
accentuation and the force of articulation. This concept of articulation
must stop us here. It had served to define arche-writing as it is
already at work within speech. And Saussure, in contradiction to his
phonologist thesis, recognized, we recall, that the power of
articulation alone---and not spoken language---was "natural to
[]{#calibre_link-3573}man." Being the condition of speech,
does[]{#calibre_link-3574} articulation itself not remain a-phasic?

Rousseau introduces the concept of articulation in [Chapter
4](#calibre_link-288){.nounder}, "On the Distinctive Characteristics of
the First Language and the Changes It Had to Undergo." The first three
chapters deal with the origin of languages. [Chapter
5](#calibre_link-27){.nounder} will be entitled "On Script."
*Articulation is the becoming-writing of language*. Rousseau, *who would
like to say* that this becoming-writing[]{#calibre_link-3575} *comes
upon the origin unexpectedly*, takes it as his premise, and according to
it *describes in fact* the way in which that *becoming-writing
encroaches upon the origin*, and arises from the origin. The
becoming-writing of language is the becoming-language of language. He
*declares* what he *wishes to say*, that is to say that articulation and
writing are a post-originary malady of language; he says or
*[]{#calibre_link-3576}describes* that which he *does not wish to say:*
articulation and therefore the space of writing operates at the origin
of language.

Like those of imitation---and for the same profound reasons---the value
and operation of articulation are ambiguous: principles of life *and*
principles of death, and therefore the motive forces of progress in the
sense that Rousseau gives to that word. He *would like to
say*[]{#calibre_link-3577} that progress, however ambivalent, occurs
*either* toward the worse, *or* toward the better, either for better or
for worse. The first chapter of the *Essay* shows in effect, according
to a concept of animal language which some hold even today, that the
*natural* languages of the animals exclude progress. "Conventional
language is characteristic of man alone. That is why man makes progress,
whether for[]{#calibre_link-3578} good or ill, and animals do not"
\[*Essay*, p. 10\].

But Rousseau *describes what he does not wish to say:* that "progress"
takes place *both* for the worse *and* for the better. At the same time.
Which annuls eschatology and teleology, just as difference---or
originary articulation---annuls archeology.

#### ***III. Articulation*** {#calibre_link-40 .h3}

All this appears in the handling of the concept of articulation. To
demonstrate it we[]{#calibre_link-3579} must make a long detour. To
understand how "articulations, which are conventional" ([Chapter
4](#calibre_link-288){.nounder}), operate, we must once again go through
the problem of the concept of nature. To avoid rushing directly into the
center of the difficulty which many commentators on Rousseau have
already well defined, we shall try, in a limited and prefatory way, to
locate it in the *Essay*. Already there it is formidable.

[]{#calibre_link-3580}
:::

[]{#calibre_link-41}***"That Movement of the Wand ..."*** Let us begin
with some simple certainties and choose some propositions whose literal
clarity leaves little in doubt. We read them in the first chapter.

*First propostion*. "Speech distinguishes man among the animals." These
[]{#calibre_link-1059}are the first words of the *Essay*. Speech is also
"the first social institution." It is therefore not natural. It is
natural to man, it belongs[]{#calibre_link-3581} to his nature, to his
essence, which is not, unlike that of animals, natural.

Speech belongs to man, to the humanity of man. But Rousseau
distinguishes between language *\[langue\]* and speech *\[parole\]*. The
usage of speech is universally human but languages are diverse.
"Language distinguishes nations from each other; one does not know where
a man comes from until he has spoken. Out of usage
and[]{#calibre_link-3582} necessity, each learns the language of his own
country. But what determines that this language is that of his country
and not of another? In order to tell, it is necessary to go back to some
principle that belongs to the locality itself and antedates its customs,
for speech, being the first social institution, owes its form to natural
causes alone" \[*Essay*, p. 5\]. Thus the natural causality
of[]{#calibre_link-3583} language splits itself in two.

1\. Speech, the possibility of discourse in general, must have, as the
first institution, only *general* natural causes (relationships between
need and passion, etc.).

2\. But beyond the general existence of speech, one must account, by
equally natural causes, for its *forms* ("speech, being the first social
institution, owes its form to natural causes alone"). It
is[]{#calibre_link-3584} the explication of the diversity of languages
by physicality, geography, climate, etc. This double natural explanation
announces the division of the *Essay* in its first part, into what
concerns language and what concerns languages. The first seven chapters
explain by natural causes language in general (or the primitive
language), its origin, and its decadence. With the eighth chapter, we
pass from[]{#calibre_link-3585} language to languages. General and local
differences are explained by natural causes.

How should this natural explanation be analyzed?

*Second proposition:* "As soon as one man was recognized by another as a
sentient, thinking being similar to himself, the desire or need to
communicate his feelings and thoughts made him seek the means to do so"
*\[Essay*, p. 5\]. Desire *or* need; the home of two
origins,[]{#calibre_link-3586} southern or northern, is already assured.
And Rousseau refuses, as he also does in the second *Discourse*, to
wonder if the language preceded the society as its condition, or
conversely. He sees no solution, and no doubt no sense, to such a
question. In the second *Discourse*, confronted by the immense
difficulty of the genealogy of language, almost giving up a natural and
purely human explanation,[]{#calibre_link-3587} Rousseau writes what is
also implied in the *Essay:* "For myself, I am so aghast at the
increasing difficulties which present themselves, and so well convinced
of the almost demonstrable impossibility that languages should owe their
original institution to merely human means, that I leave, to any one who
will undertake it, the discussion of the difficult problem, which was
most necessary, the existence[]{#calibre_link-3588} of society to the
invention of []{#calibre_link-867}language, or the invention of language
to the establishment of society" (p. 151) \[p.179\].

Same gesture in the *Essay:* one is given language and society at the
same time, at the moment when the pure state of nature is crossed, when
absolute dispersion is overcome for the first time. One attempts to
seize the origin of language at the moment of this first
crossing[]{#calibre_link-3589} over. In the second *Discourse*, we can
still locate a footnote reference: a place is indicated for that long
digression which would have been the *Essay*. It is in the first part,
immediately after the critique of Condillac and of those who, "reasoning
from the state of nature, transport there ideas taken from society."
Rousseau knows that it is very difficult to find the resource of an
explanation[]{#calibre_link-3590} for the birth of languages in the pure
state of nature and in the original dispersion. And he proposes a leap:
"We will suppose, however, that this first difficulty is obviated. Let
us for a moment then take ourselves as being on this side of the vast
space which must lie between a pure state of nature and that in which
languages had become necessary, and, admitting their necessity, let us
inquire[]{#calibre_link-3591} how they could first be established. Here
we have a new and worse difficulty to grapple with" (p. 14) \[p. 175\].

"Let us for a moment then take ourselves as being on this side of the
vast space." Up to what point? Not up to constituted society but up to
the moment when the conditions for its birth are united. Between the
pure state of nature and that moment---"a multitude of centuries,"
rhythmed[]{#calibre_link-3592} by distinct
steps.^[]{#calibre_link-748}[47](#calibre_link-400){.nounder}^ But it is
difficult to discern the stages. The difference among all Rousseau's
texts is subtle, perhaps unstable, always problematic on this point. To
the distinctions already located, we must, at the risk of complicating
the debate, add the following specification, which concerns precisely
the *Essay* in its relationship to the *Discourse*. Between the pure
state of nature and[]{#calibre_link-3593} society, Rousseau describes,
both in the *Discourse* and in the *Essay*, an age of huts. And since
that age is presented in [Chapter 9](#calibre_link-52){.nounder} of the
*Essay* as the "primitive times," one might be tempted to think that the
pure state of nature is radically situated only in the second
*Discourse* (first part), the age of huts of the *Essay* corresponding
to the one that appeared after the pure state of nature
in[]{#calibre_link-3594} the second part of the *Discourse*. Even though
this hypothesis does not seem simply false and is in fact confirmed by
many descriptive elements, it must be nuanced or complicated. As it is
evoked in the *Essay*, the age of huts is much closer to the pure state
of nature. Speaking of "primitive times," when "the sparse human
population had no more social structure than the family, no laws but
those[]{#calibre_link-3595} of nature, no language but that of gesture
and some inarticulate sounds," Rousseau adds in a note: "I consider
primitive the period of time from the dispersion of men to any period of
the human race that might be taken as determining an epoch" *\[Essay*,
p. 31, n. 1\]. And certainly familial societies do not have the same
status here as in the second part of the
*Discourse.^[]{#calibre_link-749}[48](#calibre_link-401){.nounder}^* The
two []{#calibre_link-3596}accounts become[]{#calibre_link-3597} similar,
it seems, only at the moment when, after a revolution that we shall
examine later, ties of another family are constituted, making possible
love, morality, speech. It is only the close of [Chapter
9](#calibre_link-52){.nounder} of the *Essay* that one may compare to
the second part of the *Discourse*.

"Let us for a moment then take ourselves as being on this side of the
vast space ..." and give ourselves the following
hypothesis:[]{#calibre_link-3598} starting from the state of pure
nature, thanks to a certain reversal that we shall discuss later, man
encounters man and recognizes him. Pity awakens and becomes active, he
wishes to communicate. But at that moment man has just left nature. It
is still by natural causes that the means of communication must be
explained. Man can at first use only natural dispositions or
"instruments": the[]{#calibre_link-3599} senses.

*Third proposition*. Man must therefore act by his senses upon the
senses of others. "Hence the institution of sensate signs for the
expression of thought. The inventors of language did not proceed
rationally in this way; rather their instinct suggested the consequence
of them" \[*Essay*, p. 5\]. We have two ways of working on the senses of
others: movement and voice. Naturally, Rousseau
does[]{#calibre_link-3600} not wonder what "means" or "instrument" might
mean, nor, as he does in *Emile* (p. 160), if voice is not itself a sort
of movement. "The action of movement is immediate through touching, or
mediate through gesture. The first can function only within arm's
length, while the other extends as far as the visual ray. Thus vision
and hearing are the only passive organs of language among *distinct
\[dispersés\]*[]{#calibre_link-3601} individuals" (*Essay*, p. 6)
(italics added).

The analysis of the "instruments" of language is therefore governed by
the situation of pure dispersion which characterizes the state of
nature. Language could have emerged only out of dispersion. The "natural
causes" by which one explains it are not recognized as natural except in
so far as they accord with the state of nature, which is
determined[]{#calibre_link-3602} by dispersion. This dispersion should
no doubt be overcome by language but, for that very reason, it
determines the *natural condition* of language.

The natural condition: it is remarkable that the original dispersion out
of which language began continues to mark its milieu and essence. That
language must traverse space, be obliged to be spaced, is not an
accidental trait but the mark of its origin.[]{#calibre_link-3603} In
truth, dispersion will never be a past, a prelinguistic situation in
which language would certainly have been born only to break with it. The
original dispersion leaves its mark within language. We shall have to
verify it: articulation, which seemingly introduces difference as an
institution, has for ground and space the dispersion that is natural:
space itself.

At this point, the concept[]{#calibre_link-3604} of nature becomes even
more enigmatic and if one does not want Rousseau to contradict himself
at all, one must use a great deal of analysis and sympathy.

[]{#calibre_link-3605}The natural is first valorized and then
disqualified: the original is also the inferior retained within the
superior. The language of gesture and the language of voice, sight and
hearing, are "equally natural." Nevertheless, one is more
natural[]{#calibre_link-3606} than the other and because of this it is
first and better. It is the language of gesture, which is "more easy and
depends less on conventions." Of course there can be conventions of the
language of gestures. Rousseau alludes later to a gestural code. But
that code is less remote from nature than is the spoken language. For
that reason, Rousseau begins with praise for the language of gestures
although,[]{#calibre_link-3607} further on, wishing to show the
superiority of passion over need, he will place speech above gesture.
This contradiction is only apparent. Natural immediacy is at once origin
and end, but in the double sense of these words: birth and death,
unfinished sketch and finished perfection. From then on, all value is
determined according to its proximity to an absolute nature. But as this
concept[]{#calibre_link-3608} is that of a polarized structure,
proximity is a distancing. All the contradictions of the discourse are
*regulated*, rendered necessary yet resolved, by this structure of the
concept of nature. *Before all determinations of a natural law, there
is, effectively constraining the discourse, a law of the concept of
nature*.

A contradiction regulated in this way appears in a flagrant manner when,
praising[]{#calibre_link-3609} the language of gesture, Rousseau speaks
of love. Further on, he will say of this passion that it is at the
origin of sung speech; here, he makes drawing its best interpreter. To
appeal to the eye in order to declare love is more natural, more
expressive, more *alive:* at once more immediate and more alive,
therefore more energetic, more present, more free. Thus *resolving* the
entire contradiction,[]{#calibre_link-3610} summing it up into its two
poles, the *Essay* begins with praise and concludes with condemnation of
the mute sign. The first chapter exalts language without voice, that of
glance and gesture (which Rousseau distinguishes from our
gesticulation): "Thus one speaks more effectively to the eye than to the
ear" *\[Essay*, p. 8\]. The last chapter depicts, at the other pole of
history, the ultimate servitude[]{#calibre_link-3611} of a society
organized by the circulation of silent signs: "Societies have assumed
their final form: no longer is anything changed except by arms and cash.
And since there is nothing to say to people besides *give money*, it is
said with placards on street corners or by soldiers in their homes"
*\[Essay*, p. 72\].

The mute sign is a sign of liberty when it expresses within immediacy;
then, what it[]{#calibre_link-3612} expresses and he who expresses
himself through it are *properly* present. There is neither detour nor
anonymity. The mute sign signifies slavery when re-presentative mediacy
has invaded the entire system of signification: then, through infinite
circulation and references, from sign to sign and from representer to
representer, the selfsameness *\[propre\]* of presense has no longer a
place: no one is[]{#calibre_link-3613} there for anyone, not even for
himself; one []{#calibre_link-3614}can no longer dispose of meaning; one
can no longer stop it, it is carried into an endless movement of
signification. The system of the sign has no outside. As it is speech
that has opened this endless movement *\[l'abîme\]* of
signification---thus constantly risking the loss of signification---it
is tempting to return to an archeological moment, a first
moment[]{#calibre_link-3615} of sign without speech, when passion,
beyond need but short of articulation and difference, expresses itself
in an unheard of way: an *immediate sign:*

Although the language of gesture and spoken language are equally
natural, still the first is
easier^[]{#calibre_link-750}[49](#calibre_link-402){.nounder}^ and
depends less upon conventions. For more things affect our eyes than our
ears. Also, visual forms are more varied than sounds, and more
expressive,[]{#calibre_link-3616} saying more in less time. Love, it is
said, was the inventor of drawing. It might also have invented speech,
though less happily. Not being very well pleased with it, it disdains
it; it has livelier ways of expressing itself. How she could say things
to her beloved, who traced his shadow with such pleasure! What sounds
might she use to render this movement of the magic wand? *\[Essay*, p.
6\]

The[]{#calibre_link-3617} movement of the magic wand that traces with so
much pleasure does not fall outside of the body. Unlike the spoken or
written sign, it does not cut itself off from the desiring body of the
person who traces or from the immediately perceived image of the other.
It is of course still an image which is traced at the tip of the wand,
but an image that is not completely separated from the person it
represents;[]{#calibre_link-3618} what the drawing draws is almost
present in person in his *shadow*. The distance from the shadow or from
the wand is almost nothing. She who traces, holding, handling, now, the
wand, is very close to touching what is very close to being the other
*itself*, close by a minute difference; that small
difference---visibility, spacing, death---is undoubtedly the origin of
the sign and the breaking of immediacy;[]{#calibre_link-3619} but it is
in reducing it as much as possible that one marks the contours of
signification. One thinks the sign beginning from its limit, which
belongs neither to nature nor to convention. Now this limit---of an
impossible sign, of a sign giving the signified, indeed the thing, *in
person*, immediately---is necessarily closer to gesture or glance than
to speech. A certain ideality of the sound behaves[]{#calibre_link-3620}
essentially as the power of abstraction and mediation. The movement of
the wand is rich with all possible discourses but no discourse can
reproduce it without impoverishing and deforming it. The written sign is
absent from the body but this absence is already announced within the
invisible and ethereal element of the spoken word, powerless to imitate
the contact and the movement of the bodies. The[]{#calibre_link-3621}
gesture, that of passion rather than that of need, considered in its
purity of origin, guards us against an already alienating speech, a
speech already carrying in itself death and absence. That is why, when
it does not precede the spoken word, it supplements it, corrects its
fault and fills its []{#calibre_link-1060}lack. The movement of the wand
is a substitute for all discourse that, at a greater distance,
would[]{#calibre_link-3622} substitute itself for it. This relationship
of mutual and incessant supplementarity or substitution is the order of
language. It is the origin of language, as it is described without being
declared, in the *Essay on the Origin of Languages*, which is here also
in agreement with the second *Discourse:* in both texts, the visible
gesture, more natural and more expressive, can join itself as a
supplement[]{#calibre_link-3623} to speech, which is itself a substitute
for gesture. This graphic of supplementarity is the origin of languages:
it separates gesture and speech primitively united in the mythic purity,
absolutely immediate and therefore natural, of the cry:

The first language of mankind, the most universal and vivid, in a word
the only language man needed, before he had occasion to exert his
eloquence to persuade[]{#calibre_link-3624} assembled multitudes, was
the simple cry of nature. ... When the ideas of men began to expand and
multiply, and closer communication took place among them, they strove to
invent more numerous signs and a more copious language. *They multiplied
the inflexions of the voice, and added gestures, which are in their
nature more expressive, and depend less for their meaning on a prior
determination* (p.[]{#calibre_link-3625} 148; italics added) \[p. 176\].

Gesture is here an adjunct of speech, but this *adjunct* is not a
supplementing by artifice, it is a re-course to a more natural, more
expressive, more immediate sign. It is the more universal the less it
depends on
conventions.^[]{#calibre_link-751}[50](#calibre_link-403){.nounder}^ But
if gesture supposes a distance and a spacing, a milieu of visibility, it
ceases being effective when the excess of distance or
mediation[]{#calibre_link-3626} interrupts visibility: then speech
supplements gesture. Everything in language is substitute, and this
concept of substitute precedes the opposition of nature and culture: the
supplement can equally well be natural (gesture) as artificial (speech).

But, as hardly anything can be indicated by gestures, except *objects
actually present* or easily described, and *visible actions;* as they
are not universally[]{#calibre_link-3627} in use---for darkness or the
interposition of a material object destroys their efficacy---*and as
besides they rather request than secure our attention;* men at length
bethought themselves of *substituting* for them the articulate sounds of
the voice, which, without bearing the same relation to any particular
ideas, are better calculated to express them all, as conventional
*\[institués\]* signs. *Such a substitution*[]{#calibre_link-3628} could
only be made by common consent, and must have been effected in a manner
not very easy for men whose gross organs had not been accustomed to any
such exercise. It is also in itself still more difficult to conceive,
since such a common agreement must have been motivated, and speech seems
to have been highly necessary to establish the use of it (pp. 148--49;
italics added) \[pp. 176--77\].

Speech[]{#calibre_link-3629} excites attention, the visible exacts it:
is it because the ear is always open and offered to provocation, more
passive than sight? One can []{#calibre_link-3630}*more naturally* close
one's eyes or distract his glance than avoid listening. Let us not
forget that this natural situation is primarily that of the child at the
breast.

This structure of supplementarity, reflexive, mutual, speculative,
infinite, alone permits[]{#calibre_link-3631} an explanation of the fact
that the language of space, sight, and muteness (Rousseau knew
also^[]{#calibre_link-752}[51](#calibre_link-404){.nounder}^ that it
signified death) sometimes takes the place of speech when the latter is
attended by a *greater* threat of absence and cuts into life's energy.
In that case, the language of visible gestures is more alive. Love
"might also have invented speech, though less happily. Not being very
well pleased[]{#calibre_link-3632} with it, it disdains it; it has
livelier ways of expressing itself. How she could say things to her
beloved, who traced his shadow with such pleasure! What sounds might she
use to work such magic?" \[*Essay*, p. 6\].

It is therefore after the invention of language and the birth of passion
that desire, in order to recapture presence and according to the pattern
I have identified, returns to the movement[]{#calibre_link-3633} of the
magic wand, to the finger and the eye, to a mutism charged with
discourse. It is the question of a supplementary return toward a greater
naturalness, not of an origin of language. Rousseau clarifies it further
on by distinguishing gesture from gesticulation: the former, which
sketches the shadow of presence, silently governs the first metaphor;
the latter is an indiscreet and cumbersome[]{#calibre_link-3634} adjunct
of speech. It is a bad supplement. The silent language of love is not a
prelinguistic gesture, it is a "mute eloquence."

Our \[European\] gestures merely indicate our natural unrest. It is not
of those that I wish to speak. Only Europeans gesticulate when speaking;
one might say that all their power of speech is in their arms. Their
lungs are powerful too, but to nearly no avail.
Where[]{#calibre_link-3635} a Frenchman would strain and torture his
body, emitting a great verbal torrent, a Turk will momentarily remove
his pipe from his mouth to utter a few words softly, crushing one with a
single sentence. \[Here the Turk is no longer, like his language, from
the North, but from the Orient. We are at once from the North and from
the Occident.\] \[*Essay*, p. 6\]

The value of the mute sign is also that of[]{#calibre_link-3636}
sobriety and discretion *within speech:* the economy of speech.

Since learning to gesticulate, we have forgotten the art of pantomime,
for the same reason that with all our beautiful systems of grammar we no
longer understand the symbols of the Egyptians. What the ancients said
in the liveliest way, they did not express in words but by means of
signs. They did not say it, they showed it.
*\[Essay*[]{#calibre_link-3637}, p. 6\]

What they showed was clearly not the thing but its hieroglyphic
metaphor, the visible sign. This praise of Egyptian symbolism may
surprise us: it is a praise of writing and a praise of savagery, more
precisely of that writing of which we are told further along that it
suits savages. Savagery []{#calibre_link-813}does not characterize the
primitive state of man, the state of pure nature, but rather the
state[]{#calibre_link-3638} of society being born, of the first language
and the first passions. A state structurally anterior to the state of
barbarism, itself anterior to civil society. In fact, in the chapter "On
Script" (5), Egyptian hieroglyphs are defined as the most crude and most
antique script. It would suit people assembled as a nation under the
form of savagery:

The cruder the writing, the more ancient the
langauge.[]{#calibre_link-3639} The primitive way of writing was not to
represent sounds, but objects themselves whether directly, as with the
Mexicans, or by allegorical imagery, or as the Egyptians did in still
other ways. This stage corresponds to passionate language, and already
supposes some society and some needs to which the passions have given
birth. ... The depicting of objects is appropriate to a savage people.
*\[Essay*[]{#calibre_link-3640}, pp. 16--17\]

The hieroglyphic language is an impassioned language. Savagery holds
itself closest to this passional origin of language. The paradox is that
thus it also holds itself closer to writing than to speech. Because
gesture, which elsewhere expresses need, here represents passion. It is
writing not only because it traces, like the movement of the wand, a
design in space, but because the[]{#calibre_link-3641} signifier first
signifies a signifier, and not the thing itself or a directly presented
signified. The hieroglyphic *graphie* is already allegorical. The
gesture which speaks before words *\[dit la parole avant les mots\]* and
which "argues with the eyes," is the moment of savage writing.

Consider ancient history; it is full of such ways of appealing to the
eye, each of them more effective than all[]{#calibre_link-3642} the
discourse that might have *replaced it*. An object held up before
speaking will arouse the imagination, excite curiosity, hold the mind in
suspense, in expectation of what will be said. I have noticed that
Italians and Provencals, among whom gesture ordinarily precedes
discourse, use this as a way of drawing attention and of pleasing their
listeners. *But in the most vigorous language,
everything[]{#calibre_link-3643} is said symbolically, before one
actually speaks*. Tarquin, or Thrasybulus lopping off poppies; Alexander
applying his seal to the mouth of his favorite, Diogenes promenading in
front of Zeno: do they not speak more effectively than with words? What
verbal circumlocution would express the same idea as
well?^[]{#calibre_link-753}[52](#calibre_link-405){.nounder}^ (Italics
added.) *\[Essay*, pp. 6--7\]

How can the language of gesture or sight express
passion[]{#calibre_link-3644} here, and need elsewhere? The
"contradiction" between these different texts responds to the unity of
an intention and the necessity of a constraint.

1\. Rousseau speaks the desire of immediate presence. When the latter is
*better represented* by the range of the voice and reduces dispersion,
he praises living speech, which is the language of the passions. When
the immediacy of presence is *better[]{#calibre_link-3645} represented*
by the proximity and rapidity of the gesture and the glance, he praises
the most savage writing, which does not represent oral representation:
the hieroglyph.

2\. This concept of writing designates the place of unease, of the
regulated []{#calibre_link-876}incoherence within conceptuality, both
beyond the *Essay* and beyond Rousseau. This incoherence would apply to
the fact that the unity of need and passion[]{#calibre_link-3646} (with
the entire system of associated significations) constantly effaces the
limit that Rousseau obstinately sketches and recalls. Rousseau
*declares* this backbone, without which the entire conceptual organism
would break up, and *wishes to think it* as a distinction; he
*describes* it as a supplementary differance. This constrains in its
graphics the strange unity of passion and need.

How does writing[]{#calibre_link-3647} reveal it? How is writing, like
pity, for example, both in nature and outside of it? Like the awakening
of imagination before this, what does the awakening of writing signify
here, if it belongs neither to nature nor to its other?

Writing precedes and follows speech, it comprehends it. This is already
true from the only point of view that concerns us here: that of the
structure of the *Essay*.[]{#calibre_link-3648} On the one hand, the
theory of writing follows the genealogy of speech and is proposed as a
sort of supplementary appendix. Once one has described the passional
origin of speech, one can accessorily consider that accessory which is
writing, in order to draw from it some supplementary information about
the state of languages. The entire chapter "On Script" is opened and
governed by this declared project.[]{#calibre_link-3649} After having
summarized the progress of languages and the movement of supplementarity
and substitution which holds it to its law ("one substitutes" new
articulations for accents that efface themselves, "one substitutes ideas
for sentiments," etc.), Rousseau introduces a new development: "Another
way of comparing languages and determining their relative antiquity is
to consider their script,[]{#calibre_link-3650} and reason inversely
from the degree of perfection of this art" \[p. 16\].

Yet writing had to appear even before there was a question of speech and
its passional origin. The movement of the magic wand and the hieroglyph
expressed a passion before the passion that draws out "the primitive
voices"; and as writing will also be recognized as the language of need,
it will have stated need before need.[]{#calibre_link-3651} The first
allusion to writing holds itself out of reach of all *distinction*, if
not of all differance of need from passion. The *advantage* of writing
requires a new conceptuality.

The metaphoric origin of speech opens an eye, one might say, at the
center of language. And the passion that draws out the first voices
relates to the image. The visibility inscribed on the act of birth of
the voice is[]{#calibre_link-3652} not purely perceptive, it signifies.
Writing is the eve of speech. That appears also from the first chapter.

Darius, engaged with his army in Scythia, receives from the King of
Scythia a frog, a bird, a mouse, and five arrows. The herald makes the
presentation in []{#calibre_link-964}silence and departs. That terrible
harangue was understood; and Darius returned to his own country as
quickly as he could. *Substitute[]{#calibre_link-3653} a letter*
\[namely, a phonetic script\] for this sign: the more menancing it is,
the less frightening will it be. It will be no more than a boast, which
would draw merely a smile from
Darius.^[]{#calibre_link-754}[53](#calibre_link-406){.nounder}^
\[*Essay*, p. 7\]

And after another series of Biblical and Greek examples,

*Thus one speaks more effectively to the eye than to the ear*. There is
no one who does not feel the truth of Horace's judgment in
this[]{#calibre_link-3654} regard. Clearly the most eloquent speeches
are those containing the most imagery; and sounds are never more
*forceful* than when they produce the effects of colors. (Italics
added.) *\[Essay*, p. 8\]

Decisive consequence: eloquence depends upon the image. What is already
announced is "That the First Language Had to Be Figurative" (title of
[Chapter 3](#calibre_link-239){.nounder}). The metaphor within spoken
language draws its *[]{#calibre_link-3655}energy* from the visible and
from a sort of oral picto-hieroglyphics. Now if one considers that
Rousseau elsewhere associates visibility, space, painting, writing,
etc., with the loss of passional energy, with need and sometimes with
death, one must surely decide within, the *advantage of writing*, in
favor of the unity of heterogeneous or so-declared values. But Rousseau
cannot declare this unity[]{#calibre_link-3656} of the advantage of
writing. He can only describe it clandestinely as he plays with the
different parts of his discourse. Even though he contradicts himself, he
places writing on the side of need and speech on the side of passion. In
the passage that we have just cited, it is clear that it is a question
of passional signs. That will be confirmed further along when
hieroglyphic script will be defined[]{#calibre_link-3657} as
"impassioned language." Yet if "sounds never have more energy than when
they make the effect of colors," it is not that color or that space as
such which speaks to passion. Rousseau unexpectedly reverses the order
of the demonstration: only the spoken word has the power of expressing
or exciting passion.

But when it is a question of stirring the heart and inflaming the
passions, it is an altogether[]{#calibre_link-3658} different matter.
The successive impressions of discourse, which strike a redoubled blow,
produce *a different feeling from that of the continuous presence of the
same object*, which can be taken in at a single glance. Imagine someone
in a painful situation that is fully known; as you watch the afflicted
person, you are not likely to weep. But give him time to tell you what
he feels and soon you[]{#calibre_link-3659} will burst into tears. It is
solely in this way that the scenes of a tragedy produce their
effect.[]{#calibre_link-1188}[\*](#calibre_link-407){.nounder} Pantomime
without discourse will leave you nearly tranquil; discourse without
gesture will bring tears from you. *The passions have*
[]{#calibre_link-3660}*their gestures, but they also have their
accents;* and these accents, which thrill us, *these tones of voice that
cannot fail to be heard, penetrate to the very
depths[]{#calibre_link-3661} of the heart, carrying there the emotions
they wring from us, forcing us in spite of ourselves* to feel what we
hear. *We conclude that while visible signs can render a more exact
imitation, sounds more effectively arouse interest*.

In this argument I have emphasized the two controlling strands.

Right at first the sound touches us, interests us, impassions us all the
more because *it penetrates us*[]{#calibre_link-3662}. It is the element
of interiority because its essence, its own energy, implies that its
reception is obligatory. As we noted above, I can close my eyes, I can
avoid being touched by that which I see and that which is perceptible at
a distance. But my passivity and my passion are totally open to "accents
to which one may not conceal one's organ," which "penetrate through it
to the bottom of one's[]{#calibre_link-3663} heart, and carry there in
spite of us the movements which draw them forth." Voice penetrates into
me violently, it is the privileged route for forced entry and
interiorization, whose reciprocity produces itself in the
"hearing-oneself-speak," in the structure of the voice and of
interlocution.^[]{#calibre_link-755}[54](#calibre_link-408){.nounder}^

This violence obliges Rousseau to temper the praise of passion and to
suspect this complicity between[]{#calibre_link-3664} voice and heart.
But another violence complicates this scheme even more. Within the
voice, the presence of the object already disappears. The self-presence
of the voice and of the headingoneself speak conceals the very thing
that visible space allows to be placed before us. The thing
disappearing, the voice substitutes an acoustic sign for it which can,
in the place of the object taken away, penetrate[]{#calibre_link-3665}
profoundly into me, to lodge there "in the depth of the heart." It is
the only way of interiorizing the phenomenon; by transforming it into
*akoumène;* which supposes an originary synergy and an originary
synesthesia; but which also supposes that the disappearance of presence
in the form of the object, the being-before-the-eyes or being-at-hand,
installs a sort of fiction, if not a lie, at the
very[]{#calibre_link-3666} origin of speech. Speech never gives the
thing itself, but a simulacrum that touches us more profoundly than the
truth, "strikes" us more effectively. Another ambiguity in the
appreciation of speech. It is not the presence of the object which moves
us but its phonic sign: "The successive impressions of discourse, which
strike a redoubled blow, produce a different feeling from that of the
continuous[]{#calibre_link-3667} presence of the same object. ... I have
said elsewhere why feigned misfortunes touch us more than real ones." If
the theater is condemned, it is thus not because it is, as its name
implies, a place of spectacle; it is because it makes us hear and
understand.

Thus is explained the nostalgia for a society of need that Rousseau
disqualifies so harshly elsewhere. Dream of a mute society, of a
society[]{#calibre_link-3668} before the origin of languages, that is to
say, strictly speaking, a society before society.

[]{#calibre_link-3669}This leads me to think that if the only needs we
ever experienced were physical, we should most likely never have been
able to speak; we would fully express our meanings by the language of
gesture alone. We would have been able to establish societies little
different from those we have, or such as would[]{#calibre_link-3670}
have been better able to achieve their goals. We would have been able to
institute laws, to choose leaders, to invent arts, to establish
commerce, and to do, in a word, almost as many things as we do with the
help of speech. Without fear of jealousy, the secrets of oriental
gallantry are passed across the more strictly guarded harems in the
epistolary language of salaams. The mutes of great
nobles[]{#calibre_link-3671} understand each other, and understand
everything that is said to them by means of signs, just as well as one
can understand anything said in discourse. *\[Essay*, p. 9\]

With reference to this society of mute writing, the advent of speech
resembles a catastrophe, an unpredictable misfortune. Nothing made it
necessary. At the end of the *Essay*, this pattern is exactly inverted.

Things are further[]{#calibre_link-3672} complicated if one considers
that the language of needs is a natural language and that it would be
difficult to find a sure criterion for distinguishing between this mute
society and animal society. One does then perceive that the only
difference between what Rousseau wished to consider the fixity of animal
language and the progressiveness of human languages is not dependent on
any one organ, any[]{#calibre_link-3673} one sense, is not to be found
in either the visible or the audible order. It is once again the *power
of substituting one organ for another, of articulating space and time*,
sight and voice, hand and spirit, it is this *faculty of
supplementarity* which is the true "origin"---or nonorigin---of
languages: articulation in general, as articulation of nature and of
convention, of nature and all its others.[]{#calibre_link-3674} This is
what one must emphasize right from the close of Chapter I:

It appears again, by the same observations, that the invention of the
art of communicating our ideas depends less upon the organs we use in
such communication than it does upon a power proper to man, according to
which he uses his organs in this way, and which, *if he lacked these,
would lead him to use others to the same end*.[]{#calibre_link-3675}
Give man a structure \[organically\] as crude as you please: doubtless
he will acquire fewer ideas, but if only he has some means of contact
with his fellow men, by means of which one can act and another can
sense, he will finally succeed in communicating whatever ideas he might
have. Animals have a more than sufficient structure for such
communication, but none of them has ever made use of it.
This[]{#calibre_link-3676} seems to me a quite characteristic
difference. That those animals which *live and work in common, such as
beavers, ants, bees, have some natural language for communicating among
themselves, I would not question*. There is even reason to think that
the speech of beavers and ants is *by gesture; i.e., it is only visual*.
If so, such languages are natural, not acquired. The animals that speak
them possess[]{#calibre_link-3677} them a-borning: they all have them,
and they are everywhere the same. They are entirely unchanging and make
not the []{#calibre_link-1061}slightest progress. Conventional language
is characteristic of man alone. (Italics added.) *\[Essay*, p. 10\]

Animal language---and animality in general---represents here the still
living myth of fixity, of symbolic incapacity, of nonsupplementarity. If
we consider the []{#calibre_link-3678}[]{#calibre_link-3679}*concept* of
animality not in its content of understanding or misunderstanding but in
its specific *function*, we shall see that it must locate a moment of
*life* which knows nothing of symbol, substitution, lack and
supplementary addition, etc.---everything, in fact, whose appearance and
play I wish to describe here. A life that has not yet broached the play
of supplementarity and which at the same time[]{#calibre_link-3680} has
not yet let itself be violated by it: a life without differance and
without articulation.

[]{#calibre_link-42}***The Inscription of the Origin*.** This detour was
necessary for recapturing the function of the concept of *articulation*.
It broaches language: it opens speech as institution born of passion but
it threatens song as original speech. It pulls language toward need and
reason---accomplices---and therefore lends[]{#calibre_link-3681} itself
to writing more easily. The more articulated a language is, the less
accentuated it is, the more rational it is, the less musical it is, and
the less it loses by being written, the better it expresses need. It
becomes Nordic.

Rousseau wants us to think of this movement as an accident. He describes
it however in its originary necessity. This unhappy accident is also a
"natural progress."[]{#calibre_link-3682} It does not come unexpectedly
upon a constituted song, nor does it surprise a full music. Before
articulation, therefore, we now know, there is no speech, no song, and
thus no music. Passion could not be expressed or imitated without
articulation. The "cry of nature" (second *Discourse*), the "simple
sounds \[that\] emerge naturally from the throat" (*Essay* 4), do not
make a language because articulation[]{#calibre_link-3683} has not yet
played there. "Natural sounds are inarticulate" (*Essay* 4). Convention
has its hold only upon articulation, which pulls language out of the
cry, and increases itself with consonants, tenses, and quantity. *Thus
language is born out of the process of its own degeneration*. That is
why, in order to convey Rousseau's *descriptive* procedure, which does
not wish to restore the facts but merely[]{#calibre_link-3684} to
measure a deviation, it is perhaps imprudent to call by the name of zero
degree or simple origin that out of which the deviation is measured or
the structure outlined. Zero degree or origin implies that the
commencement be simple, that it not be at the same time the beginning of
a degeneration, that it be possible to think it in the form of presence
in general, whether it be a modified presence[]{#calibre_link-3685} or
not, whether it be past event or permanent essence. To speak of simple
origin, it must also be possible to measure deviation according to a
simple axis and in a single []{#calibre_link-1025}direction. Is it still
necessary to recall that nothing in Rousseau's description authorizes us
to do so?

To speak of origin and zero degree in fact comments on Rousseau's
declared intention and it corrects on that point
more[]{#calibre_link-3686} than one classical or hasty reading. But in
spite of that declared intention, Rousseau's discourse lets itself be
constrained by a complexity which always has the form of the supplement
of or from the origin. His declared intention is not annulled by this
but rather *inscribed* within a system which it no longer dominates. The
desire for the origin becomes an indispensable and indestructible
function[]{#calibre_link-3687} situated within a syntax without origin.
Rousseau would like to separate originarity from supplementarity. All
the rights constituted by our logos are on his side: it is unthinkable
and intolerable that what has the name *origin* should be no more than a
point situated within the system of supplementarity. The latter in fact
wrenches language from its condition of origin, from its conditional
or[]{#calibre_link-3688} its future of origin, from that which it must
(ought to) have been and what it has never been; it could only have been
born by suspending its relation to all origin. Its history is that of
the supplement of (from) origin: of the originary substitute and the
substitute of the origin. Let us observe the play of the tenses and
modes at the end of [Chapter 4](#calibre_link-24){.nounder} which
describes the ideal of the language[]{#calibre_link-3689} of origin:

Since natural sounds are inarticulate, words *would have* few
articulations. Interposing some consonants to fill the gaps between
vowels *would suffice* to make them fluid and easy to pronounce. On the
other hand, the sounds would be very varied, and the diversity of
accents for each sound *would further multiply* them. Quantity and
rhythm *would account for* still further combinations.
Since[]{#calibre_link-3690} sounds, accents, and number, which are
natural, would leave little to articulation, which is conventional, it
*would be sung* rather than spoken. Most of the root words would be
imitative sounds or accents of passion, or effects of sense objects. It
*would contain* many onomatopoeic expressions. This language *would
have* many synonyms for expressing the same thing according to various
relationships.[]{#calibre_link-1190}[\*](#calibre_link-409){.nounder}[]{#calibre_link-3691}
It *would have* few adverbs and abstract names for expressing these same
relationships. It *would have* many augmentatives, diminutives,
composite words, expletive particles to indicate the cadence of
sentences and fullness of phrases. It *would have* many irregularities
and anomalies. It *would deemphasize* grammatical analogy for euphony,
number, harmony, and beauty of sounds. Instead of
arguments,[]{#calibre_link-3692} it *would have* aphorisms. It *would
persuade* without convincing, and *would represent* without reasoning.
\[Follows the customary extrinsic or archaeological reference.\] It
*would resemble* Chinese in certain respects, Greek and Arabic in
others. If you understand these ideas in all their ramifications, you
will find that Plato's *Cratylus* is not as ridiculous as it appears to
be (italics added) \[pp.[]{#calibre_link-3693} 15--16\].

[]{#calibre_link-3694}The stage thus described in the conditional is
*already* that of a language that has broken with gesture, need,
animality, etc. But of a language that *has not yet* been corrupted by
articulation, convention, supplementarity. The time of that language is
the unstable, inaccessible, mythic limit between that *already* and this
*not-yet:* time of a language *being born*, just as there was a
time[]{#calibre_link-3695} for "society being born." Neither before nor
after the origin.

After having observed this play of the temporal mode, let us continue
with our reading. The chapter "On Script" follows immediately. The title
alone separates the quotation above from the one following. I stress the
sense of certain verbs and the mode of all the verbs:

Anyone who studies the history and progress of the tongues
will[]{#calibre_link-3696} see that the more the words become
monotonous, the more the consonants multiply; that, as accents fall into
disuse and quantities are neutralized, they are *replaced \[supplée\]*
by grammatical combinations and new articulations. But only the pressure
of time brings these changes about. To the degree that needs multiply,
that affairs become complicated, that light is shed \[knowledge is
increased\],[]{#calibre_link-3697} language changes its character. It
becomes more regular and less passionate. It *substitutes* ideas for
feelings. It no longer speaks to the heart but to reason. For that very
reason, accent diminishes, articulation increases. Language becomes more
exact and clearer, but more prolix, duller and colder. This progression
seems to me entirely natural \[p. 16\].

Thus supplementarity makes possible all[]{#calibre_link-3698} that
constitutes the property of man: speech, society, passion, etc. But what
is this property *\[propre\]* of man? On the one hand, it is that of
which the possibility must be thought before man, and outside of him.
Man allows himself to be announced to himself after the fact of
supplementarity, which is thus not an attribute---accidental or
essential---of man. For on the other hand,
supplementarity,[]{#calibre_link-3699} which *is nothing*, neither a
presence nor an absence, is neither a substance nor an essence of man.
It is precisely the play of presence and absence, the opening of this
play that no metaphysical or ontological concept can comprehend.
Therefore this property *\[propre\]* of man is not a property of man: it
is the very dislocation of the proper in general: it is the dislocation
of the characteristic,[]{#calibre_link-3700} the proper in general, the
impossibility---and therefore the desire---of self-proximity; the
impossibility and therefore the desire of pure presence. That
supplementarity is not a characteristic or property of man does not mean
only, and in an equally radical manner, that it is not a characteristic
or property; but also that its play precedes what one calls man and
extends outside of him. Man *calls[]{#calibre_link-3701} himself* man
only by drawing limits excluding his other from the play of
supplementarity: the purity of nature, of animality, primitivism,
childhood, madness, divinity. The approach to these limits is at once
feared as a threat of death, and desired as access to a life without
differance. The history of man *calling himself* man
[]{#calibre_link-909}is the articulation of *all* these limits among
themselves. All concepts[]{#calibre_link-3702} determining a
non-supplementarity (nature, animality, primitivism, childhood, madness,
divinity, etc.) have evidently no truth-value. They belong---moreover,
with the idea of truth itself---to an epoch of supplementarity. They
have meaning only within a closure of the game.

Writing will appear to us more and more as another name for this
structure of supplementarity. If one takes into account
that,[]{#calibre_link-3703} according to Rousseau himself, articulation
makes possible both speech and writing (a language is necessarily
articulated and the more articulated it is, the more it lends itself to
writing) one should be assured of what Saussure hesitated to say in what
we know of the *Anagrams*, namely, that there are no phonemes before the
grapheme. That is, before that which operates as a principle of
death[]{#calibre_link-3704} within speech.

Perhaps now one will better grasp the situation of Rousseau's discourse
with reference to this concept of the supplement, and by the same token,
the status of the analysis that I am attempting here. It does not
suffice to say that Rousseau thinks the supplement without thinking it,
that he does not match his saying and his meaning, his descriptions and
his declarations. One must[]{#calibre_link-3705} still organize this
separation and this contradiction. Rousseau uses the word and describes
the thing. But now we know that what concerns us here belongs neither to
word nor to thing. Word and thing are referential limits that only the
supplementary structure can produce and mark.

Using the word and describing the thing, Rousseau in a way displaces and
deforms the sign "supplement," the unity[]{#calibre_link-3706} of the
signifier and the signified, as it is articulated among nouns
(supplement, substitute *\[supplément, suppléant\]*), verbs (to supply,
to be substituted *\[suppléer, se substituer\]*, etc.) and adjectives
(supplementary, suppletory *\[supplémentaire, supplétif\]*) and makes
the signifieds play on the register of plus or minus. But these
displacements and deformations are regulated by the
contradictory[]{#calibre_link-3707} unity---itself supplementary---of a
desire. As in the dream, as Freud analyzes it, incompatibles are
simultaneously admitted as soon as it is a matter of satisfying a
desire, in spite of the principle of identity, or of the excluded third
party---the logical time of consciousness. Using a word other than
dream, inaugurating a conceptuality which would no longer belong to the
metaphysics of presence or[]{#calibre_link-3708} consciousness (opposing
wakefulness and dream even within Freud's discourse), it would be
necessary to define a space in which this regulated "contradiction" has
been possible and can be described. What is called "history of ideas"
would have to begin by disengaging this space before articulating its
field in terms of other fields. These are, of course, questions that can
only be asked.

What[]{#calibre_link-3709} are the two contradictory possibilities that
Rousseau wishes to retain simultaneously? And how does he do it? He
wishes on the one hand []{#calibre_link-931}to *affirm*, by giving it a
positive value, everything of which articulation is the principle or
everything with which it constructs a system (passion, language,
society, man, etc.). But he intends to affirm simultaneously all that is
cancelled by articulation (accent,[]{#calibre_link-3710} life, energy,
passion yet again, and so on). The supplement being the articulated
structure of these two possibilities, Rousseau can only decompose them
and dissociate them into two simple units, logically contradictory yet
allowing an intact purity to both the negative and the positive. And yet
Rousseau, caught, like the logic of identity, *within* the graphic of
supplementarity, says what he does[]{#calibre_link-3711} not wish to
say, describes what he does not wish to conclude: that the positive (is)
the negative, life (is) death, presence (is) absence and that this
repetitive supplementarity is not comprised in any dialectic, at least
if that concept is governed, as it always has been, by a horizon of
presence. Moreover, Rousseau is not alone in being caught in the graphic
of supplementarity. All meaning[]{#calibre_link-3712} and therefore all
discourse is caught there, particularly and by a singular turn, the
discourse of the metaphysics within which Rousseau's concepts move. And
when Hegel will proclaim the unity of absence and presence, of nonbeing
and being, dialectics or history will continue to be, at least on the
level of discourse that we have called Rousseau's wishing-to-say, a
movement of mediation between two[]{#calibre_link-3713} full presences.
Eschatological parousia is also the presence of the full speech,
bringing together all its differences and its articulations within the
consciousness (of) self of the logos. Consequently, before asking the
necessary questions about the historical situation of Rousseau's text,
we must locate all the signs of its appurtenance to the metaphysics of
presence, from Plato to Hegel, rhythmed[]{#calibre_link-3714} by the
articulation of presence upon self-presence. The unity of this
metaphysical tradition should be respected in its general permanence
through all the marks of appurtenance, the genealogical sequences, the
stricter routes of causality that organize Rousseau's text. We must
recognize, prudently and as a preliminary, what this historicity amounts
to; without this, what one would inscribe within[]{#calibre_link-3715} a
narrower structure would not be a text and above all not Rousseau's
text. It does not suffice to understand Rousseau's text within that
implication of the epochs of metaphysics or of the West---what I only
diffidently sketch here. We must also know that this history of
metaphysics, to which the concept of history itself returns, belongs to
an ensemble for which the name history is no
longer[]{#calibre_link-3716} suitable. All this interplay of
implications is so complex that it would be more than imprudent to wish
to assure oneself as to how much of it is proper to a text *\[revient en
propre à un texte\]*, for example, Rousseau's. That is not only
difficult, it is in fact impossible; the question which one professes to
answer here has undoubtedly no meaning outside of the metaphysics of
presence, of the[]{#calibre_link-3717} proper *\[propre\]* and of the
subject. There is not, strictly speaking, a text whose author or subject
is Jean-Jacques Rousseau. []{#calibre_link-1074}From this principal
proposition, it remains to draw the rigorous consequences, without
confusing all the subordinate propositions under the pretext that their
meaning and their limits are already contested at their root.

[]{#calibre_link-43}***The Neume*.** We shall, then, examine how
Rousseau[]{#calibre_link-3718} operates when, for example, he attempts
to define the limit of possibility of the thing whose impossibility he
describes: the natural voice or the inarticulate language. No longer the
animal cry before the birth of language; but not yet the articulated
language, already shaped and undermined by absence and death. Between
the prelinguistic and the linguistic, between cry and speech, animal and
man,[]{#calibre_link-3719} nature and society, Rousseau looks for a
limit "being born," and he gives it several determinations. There are at
least two of them that have the same function. They relate to childhood
and to God. In each, two contradictory predicates are united: it is a
matter of language uncontaminated by supplementarity.

The model of this impossible "natural voice" is first that of childhood.
Described in[]{#calibre_link-3720} the conditional in the *Essay*---let
us recall the analysis of the "natural voices" that "are not
articulated"---consider it now in *Emile*. The *alibi* and the *in illo
tempore* are no longer Chinese or Greek, but the child:

*All our languages are the result of art*. It has long been a subject of
inquiry whether there ever was a *natural language* common to all; no
doubt there is, *and it is the language of[]{#calibre_link-3721}
children before they begin \[have learned\] to speak. This language is
inarticulate, but it has tone, stress, and meaning. The use of our own
language has led us to neglect it so far as to forget it altogether*.
Let us study children and we shall soon learn it afresh from them.
Nurses can teach us this language; they understand all their nurslings
say to them, they answer them, and keep up long
conversations[]{#calibre_link-3722} with them; and though they use
words, these words are quite useless. *It is not the sense of the word,
but its accompanying intonation \[accent\] that is understood* (p. 45;
italics added) \[p. 32\].

To *speak before knowing how to speak*, such is the limit toward which
Rousseau obstinately guides his repetition of origin. This limit is
indeed that of nonsupplementarity but as there must already be
language[]{#calibre_link-3723} there, the supplement must announce
itself without having been produced, lack and absence must have begun
without beginning. Without the summons of the supplement, the child
would not speak at all: if he did not suffer, if he lacked nothing, he
would not call, he would not speak. But if supplementarity had simply
been produced, if it had really begun, the child would speak knowing how
to speak.[]{#calibre_link-3724} *The child speaks before knowing how to
speak*. He has language, but what is lacking in it is the power of
*replacing itself*, of substituting one sign for another, one organ of
expression for another; what he lacks is, as the *Essay* said, let us
recall, "a power proper to man, according to which he uses his organs in
this way, and which, if he lacked these, would lead him to use others to
the same[]{#calibre_link-3725} end" \[p. 10\]. The
[]{#calibre_link-3726}child---the concept of the child---is the concept
of one who has no more than one language because he has only one organ.
And that signifies that his lack, his unease itself, is unique and
uniform, not countenancing any substitution or any operation of
supplementing. Such is Rousseau's child. He has no language because he
has only one:

He has only one language because he has, so[]{#calibre_link-3727} to
say, only one kind of discomfort. In the imperfect state of his sense
organs he does not distingiush their several impressions; all ills
produce one feeling of sorrow. (p. 46) *\[Emile*, p. 32\]

The child will know how to speak when one form of his unease can be
substituted for another; then he will be able to slip from one language
to another, slide one sign under another, play with the
signifying[]{#calibre_link-3728} substance; he will enter into the order
of the supplement, here determined as the human order: he will no longer
weep, he will know how to say "I hurt."

When children begin to talk they cry less. This progress is quite
natural; one language supplants another. ... When once Emile has said,
"It hurts me," it will take a very sharp pain to make him cry. (p. 59)
*\[Emile*, p. 41\]

To speak before knowing[]{#calibre_link-3729} how: childhood is good
because speech is good, the property *\[propre\]* of man. The child
speaks. Childhood is good because the knowledge of speech comes only
with the evil of articulation. The child does not know how to speak. But
childhood is not good since already it speaks; and it is not good
because it does not have the property and the good of man: knowledge of
speech. Whence the regulated[]{#calibre_link-3730} instability of the
judgments on childhood: for better and for worse, it is sometimes on the
side of animality, sometimes on the side of humanity. That the child
speaks without knowing how to speak, that may be to his credit; but he
also speaks without knowing how to sing: which is why he is no longer an
animal that neither speaks nor sings, and not yet a man who both speaks
and sings:

Man has[]{#calibre_link-3731} three kinds of voice, the speaking or
articulate voice, the singing or melodious voice, and the pathetic or
accented voice, which serves as the language of the passions, and gives
life to song and speech. The child has these three voices, just as the
man has them, but he does not know how to use them in combination. Like
us, he laughs, cries, laments, shrieks, and groans, but he does not know
how[]{#calibre_link-3732} to combine these inflections with speech or
song. These three voices find their best expression in perfect music.
Children are incapable of such music, and their singing lacks feeling.
In the same way their spoken language lacks expression; they shout, but
they do not speak with emphasis, and there is as little power in their
voice as there is emphasis in their speech. (*Emile*, pp. 161--62)
\[p.[]{#calibre_link-3733} 113\]

Articulation, wherever one finds it, is indeed articulation: that of the
members and the organs, differance (in the) (self-same) *\[propre\]*
body. Is []{#calibre_link-830}not breath seemingly the most appropriate
thing for effacing this differance in natural expression? A speaking and
singing breath, breath of language which is nonetheless inarticulate.

Such a breath cannot have a human origin and a human
destination.[]{#calibre_link-3734} It is no longer on the way to
humanity like the language of the child, but is rather on the way to
superhumanity. Its principle and its end are theological, as the voice
and providence of nature. It is on this onto-theological model that
Rousseau regulates his repetitions of origin. With this exemplary model
of a pure breath (*pneuma*) and of an intact life, of a song and an
inarticulate language,[]{#calibre_link-3735} of speech without spacing,
we have, even if it is placeless *\[atopique\]* or utopian, a paradigm
suitable to our measure. We can name and define it. It is the *neume:*
pure vocalization, form of an inarticulate song without speech, whose
name means breath, which is inspired in us by God and may address only
Him. The *Dictionary of Music* defines it as such :

NEUME. s.f. A term in church-music. The neume[]{#calibre_link-3736} is a
kind of short recapitulation of the air in a mode, which is made at the
end of an antiphon, by a simple variety of sounds, and without joining
to them any words. The Catholics authorize this singular custom on a
passage of St. Augustine, who says, that no words being possible to be
worthy of pleasing God, it is laudable to address him in a confused
music of jubilation. "For to whom is such[]{#calibre_link-3737} a
jubilation suitable, unless to an ineffable Being? and how can we
celebrate this ineffable Being, *since we cannot be silent, or find any
thing in our transports which can express them, unless unarticulated
sounds?"* (Italics added.) \[pp. 270--71\]

To speak before knowing how to speak, not to be able either to be silent
or to speak, this limit of origin is indeed that of a pure presence,
present[]{#calibre_link-3738} enough to be living, to be felt in
pleasure *\[jouissance\]* but pure enough to have remained unblemished
by the work of difference, inarticulate enough for self-delight
*\[jouissance de soi\]* not to be corrupted by interval, discontinuity,
alterity. Indeed, Rousseau thinks that this experience of a continual
present is *accorded* only to God: given to God or to those whose hearts
accord and agree with[]{#calibre_link-3739} God's. It is indeed this
accord, this resemblance of the divine and the human that inspires him
when he dreams, in the *Reveries*, of that experience of a time reduced
to presence, *"where the present lasts forever, without marking its
duration in any way, and without any trace of succession"* \[p. 113\].

Let us reread all these pages: they speak the sorrow of time torn in its
presence by memory and[]{#calibre_link-3740} anticipation. The pleasure
*\[jouissance\]* of a continuous and inarticulate presence is a *nearly*
impossible experience: "scarcely is there, in our most living delights,
a moment where the heart can truly say to us: I *wish that this moment
should last forever"* \[pp. 112--13\]. The heart is not on organ because
it is not inscribed with a system of differences
[]{#calibre_link-3741}and articulations. It is not an organ
because[]{#calibre_link-3742} it is the organ of pure presence. Rousseau
experienced this nearly impossible state on the Island of St. Pierre.
Much has been
written^[]{#calibre_link-756}[55](#calibre_link-410){.nounder}^ of that
description on the themes of nature, water, flowing, etc. Comparing it
to pure vocalization, to the pure vowels of the natural language and of
the neume, I shall extract from it only the system of four
significations.

The pleasure *\[jouissance\]* of self-presence,[]{#calibre_link-3743}
pure auto-affection, uncorrupted by any outside, is *accorded* to God:

What is the nature of pleasure in such a situation? Nothing external to
oneself, nothing except oneself and one's own *\[propre\]* existence; so
long as this state lasts, one suffices to oneself, like God \[pp.
113---14\].

There must be *movement*, life, *\[jouissance\]* delight in time,
self-presence there. But that movement should be
*[]{#calibre_link-3744}without intervals*, without difference, without
discontinuity:

There should be neither an absolute repose nor too much agitation, but a
uniform and moderate movement which should have neither shocks nor
intervals. Without movement, life is only a lethargy. If the movement is
unequal or too strong, it awakens. ... The movement which does not come
from without, then, is made within us.

This movement[]{#calibre_link-3745} is an *inarticulate speech*, a
speech before words, alive enough to speak, pure, interior and
homogeneous enough to relate to no object, to gather into itself no
mortal difference, no negativity; it is a charm and therefore a song:

If the movement is unequal or too strong, it awakens; in recalling us to
environing objects, it destroys the charm of the reverie and draws us
out of ourselves to put[]{#calibre_link-3746} us in an instant under the
yoke of fortune and man and to bring us back to the feeling of our
unhappiness. An absolute silence leads to sadness; it offers us an image
of death \[p. 115\].

Yet, if our hearts are pure enough for it, we live this almost
impossible experience, that is almost alien to the constraints of
supplementarity, already as a supplement, as a *compensation
\[dédommagement\]*. And[]{#calibre_link-3747} it is the difference
between our experience and that of God Himself:

But an unfortunate who has been withdrawn from human society, and who
can do nothing here below that is useful or good for himself or for
others, can find in that state consolations *\[dédommagements\]* for all
human enjoyments which fortune and man cannot remove from him. It is
true that these consolations cannot be felt by all[]{#calibre_link-3748}
souls, nor in all situations. It is necessary that the heart should be
at peace and that no passion should come to trouble the calm \[p. 114\].

The difference between God and ourselves is that God distributes, and we
receive, compensations. Rousseau's entire moral theology implies, and
[]{#calibre_link-3749}the *Vicar* often uses this word, that divine
solicitude can always procure just *compensations*. God alone may
dispense[]{#calibre_link-3750} with the supplement that He dispenses. He
is the dispensation of (exemption from) the supplement.

The neume, the spell of self-presence, inarticulate experience of time,
tantamount to saying: *utopia*. Such a language---since a language must
be involved---does not, properly speaking, take place. It does not know
articulation, which cannot take place without spacing and without
organization of spaces.[]{#calibre_link-3751} There is no language
before differences of locale.

The four chapters on "General and Local Difference in the Origin of
Languages" (8), "Formation of the Southern Languages" (9), "Formation of
the Languages of the North" (10) and "Reflections on these Differences"
(11) give the lie by their description to what seems required by the
declared organization of the *Essay*. What they describe is
that[]{#calibre_link-3752} before articulation, that is to say before
local difference, there is nothing that one may call language. For we
shall see that local differences between the two poles of language
always amount to an articulatory play. One cannot therefore describe the
structure or the general essence of the language without taking
topography into account. Yet that is what Rousseau wanted to do by
dealing with language[]{#calibre_link-3753} in general before beginning
the chapter on the general and local difference in the origin of
languages. In doing so, he had believed it possible to dissociate
structure from origin, or structural origin from local origin: "All that
I have said so far applies to primitive tongues in general, and to such
development as is due merely to the passage of time. But it does not
explain either their[]{#calibre_link-3754} origin or their differences"
*\[Essay*, p. 30\]. Thus opens the eighth chapter.

If it is true that hereafter articulation measures local difference and
that nothing precedes it within language, can one conclude from it that
in the classification of languages, in their local or geographic
distribution, in the structure of their development, there is no more
than a play of correspondences, situations,[]{#calibre_link-3755}
relations? Can one conclude from it that there is no absolute, immobile,
and natural center? There again, we must distinguish between description
and declaration.

Rousseau *declares* the center: there is one single origin, one single
zero point in the history of languages. It is the South, the warmth of
life, the energy of passion. In spite of the apparent symmetry of the
two chapters, in spite[]{#calibre_link-3756} of that *description* of a
double origin of which we have spoken above, Rousseau *does not wish* to
speak of the two poles of formation: only of a formation and a
deformation. Language truly forms itself only in the South. The
originary center of language is well reflected in the center of the
*Essay*, in that Chapter 9, which is by far the longest and richest of
all.

In spite of appearances, and contrary[]{#calibre_link-3757} to what one
might think, Rousseau does not here simply stop putting aside all the
facts. No doubt the factual content is richer than in the second
*Discourse*. But it functions as a []{#calibre_link-855}structural
index, with the "consciousness of example" which regulates the
phenomenological intuition of essence. The first lines, the first note,
already authorize this interpretation:

In primitive
times[]{#calibre_link-1192}[\*](#calibre_link-411){.nounder} the
sparse[]{#calibre_link-3758} human population had no more social
structure than the family, no laws but those of nature, no language, but
that of gesture and some inarticulate sounds.

The expression "primitive times," and all the evidence which will be
used to describe them, refer to no date, no event, no chronology. One
can vary the facts without modifying the structural invariant. It is a
time before time. In every possible[]{#calibre_link-3759} historical
structure, there seemingly would be a prehistoric, presocial, and also
prelinguistic stratum, that one ought always to be able to lay bare.
Dispersion, absolute solitude, mutism, experience irrevocably destined
to a prereflexive sensation, immediate, without memory, without
anticipation, without imagination, without the power of reason or
comparison, such would be the virgin soil[]{#calibre_link-3760} of any
social, historic, or linguistic adventure. Recourse to factual
illustration, even to events distant from the origin, is purely fictive.
Rousseau is sure of that. And when we make objections to him on
historical grounds, or when he seems to make similar objections to
himself, in the name of verisimilitude or the compossibility of facts,
he wheels around, reminds us that he could not care
less[]{#calibre_link-3761} about facts when he describes the origin and
that he has given a definition of "primitive times."

I am told that Cain was a farmer and Noah planted grapes. Why not? They
were solitaries. What did they have to fear? Besides, this does not
conflict with my thesis. I have said what I understand by primitive
times. *\[Essay*, p. 34\]

We have here another way into the problem of the relationships
between[]{#calibre_link-3762} the *Essay* and the second *Discourse*
from the point of view of the state of pure nature. There is nothing
before the "primitive times" and therefore no rigorously determinable
discrepancy between the two texts. We suggested it above in connection
with the age of huts. Now we must be more precise.

At first reading, the discrepancy seems incontestable. The "savage" of
the *Discourse* wanders in the[]{#calibre_link-3763} forests "without
industry, without speech, and without home" \[p. 188\]. The barbarian of
the *Essay* has a family, a cabin and a language, even if he is reduced
to "gesture and some inarticulate sounds" \[p. 31\].

But these discordancies do not seem pertinent from the point of view
that interests us. Rousseau is not describing two different and
successive states. The family, in the *Essay*, is not
a[]{#calibre_link-3764} society. It does not limit the primitive
[]{#calibre_link-932}dispersion. "In primitive times the *sparse* human
population had no more social structure than the family." Which
signifies that this family was not a society. It was, as J. Mosconi has
called it (cf. supra), a preinstitutional phenomenon, purely natural and
biological. It was the indispensable condition of that process of
generations that the *Discourse*[]{#calibre_link-3765} also recognized
("the generations multiplied uselessly"). This natural milieu, entailing
no institution, had no *true language*. And after having attributed
"gesture and some inarticulate sounds" to them as language, Rousseau is
more precise in a note:

Genuine languages are not at all of domestic origin. They can be
established only under a more general, more durable covenant. The
American savages[]{#calibre_link-3766} hardly speak at all except
outside their homes. Each keeps silent in his hut, speaking to his
family by signs. And these signs are used infrequently, for a savage is
less disquieted, less impatient than a European; he has fewer needs and
he is careful to meet them himself.

But to efface the contradiction or rigorous discrepancy between the two
texts, one does not have to reduce them to
repetitions[]{#calibre_link-3767} or overlappings of each other. From
one to the other, an emphasis is displaced, a continuous sliding is in
operation. Or rather, without imputing any order of succession there, we
may say that from the *Discourse* to the *Essay* the sliding movement is
toward continuity. The *Discourse* wants to *mark the beginning:* it
therefore sharpens and radicalizes the characteristics of virginity
within the state[]{#calibre_link-3768} of pure nature. The *Essay* would
make us *sense the beginnings*, the movement by which "men sparsely
placed on the face of the earth," continuously wrench themselves away,
within a society *being born*, from the state of pure nature. It
captures man as he *passes* into birth, in that subtle transition from
origin to genesis. These two projects do not contradict each other, one
does not even have priority[]{#calibre_link-3769} over the other, and,
as I have noted above, the description of pure nature in the *Discourse*
made room within itself for such a transition.

As always, it is the ungraspable limit of the *almost*. Neither nature
nor society, but *almost* society. Society in the process of birth. The
moment when man, no longer belonging, or almost not belonging, to the
state of pure nature (which, the *Discourse*
clearly[]{#calibre_link-3770} says, "no longer exists, perhaps never did
exist, and probably will never exist; and of which it is, nevertheless,
necessary to have true ideas, in order to form a proper judgment of our
present state," "Preface") \[p. 155\], holds himself still short of
society, or almost so. It is the only means of restoring the
becoming-culture of nature. The family, which Hegel too will call
prehistoric, the[]{#calibre_link-3771} hut, the language of gestures and
inarticulate sounds, are the indications of that *almost*. The "savage"
life of hunters, the "barbaric" and pre-agricultural life of shepherds,
correspond to this state of almost-society. As in the *Discourse*, so in
[]{#calibre_link-811}the *Essay* society depends upon agriculture and
agriculture upon
metallurgy.^[]{#calibre_link-757}[56](#calibre_link-412){.nounder}^

Rousseau encounters here the problem of references to Holy Writ. One
can[]{#calibre_link-3772} in fact object that "there was already a great
deal of agriculture in the time of the patriarchs." The response further
clarifies the status of factual history. The facts reported by the
Scriptures do not concern the state of pure nature. But instead of
bluntly distinguishing between structural origin and empirical origin, a
conciliatory Rousseau hides behind a Biblical authority which
furnishes[]{#calibre_link-3773} him with a structural pattern, by
admitting that the patriarchal age is much removed from the origins:

All this is true. But the ages should not be confused. The patriarchal
period that we know is very remote from primitive times. Scripture lists
ten intervening generations at a time when men were very long-lived.
What did they do during these ten generations? We know nothing about it.
*Living[]{#calibre_link-3774} almost without society, widely scattered,
hardly speaking at all, how could they write?* And given the uniformity
of their isolated life, what events would they have transmitted to us?
(Italics added.) *\[Essay*, pp. 35--36\]

Rousseau adds another resource to this Biblical one: the decadence or
the re-decline into barbarism after passing through agriculture. Thanks
to a catastrophic event annulling[]{#calibre_link-3775} progress and
compelling repetition, structural analysis can recommence from zero.
This confirms that the structural account does not follow a linear
genesis but indicates permanent possibilities which may at any moment
reappear in the course of a cycle. The nearlysocial state of barbarism
may *in fact* exist before or after, indeed during and under the state
of society.

Adam spoke, Noah spoke;[]{#calibre_link-3776} but it is known that Adam
was taught by God himself. In scattering, the children of Noah abandoned
agriculture, and the common tongue perished with the first society. That
had happened before there was any Tower of Babel. *\[Essay*, p. 36\]

Because there may always be a resurgence of dispersion, because its
threat belongs to the essence of society, the analysis of the state of
pure nature and the[]{#calibre_link-3777} recourse to natural
explanations is always possible. On that point Rousseau's procedure is
reminiscent of Condillac's: who, while admitting that language was given
by God as a finished product to Adam and Eve, supposes "that some time
after the deluge two children, one male, and the other female, wandered
about in the deserts, before they understood the use of any sign." "Let
me then be permitted[]{#calibre_link-3778} to make the supposition, and
the question will be to know, in what manner this nation first invented
language."^[]{#calibre_link-758}[57](#calibre_link-413){.nounder}^ This
discourse, this detour, had already been practiced by
Warburton---Condillac cites him---and what Kant will borrow in
[]{#calibre_link-1062}*Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen
Vernunft[]{#calibre_link-1194}[\*](#calibre_link-414){.nounder}* will at
least be analogous.

If there was then a slight shift from the *Discourse* to the *Essay*, it
is the result[]{#calibre_link-3779} of that continuous sliding, that
slow transition from pure nature to the birth of society. But this
evidence is not so simple. For no continuity from inarticulate to
articulate, from pure nature to culture, from plenitude to the play of
supplementarity, is possible. The *Essay*, having to describe the
*birth*, the being-born of the supplement, must reconcile the two times.
*The departure from nature[]{#calibre_link-3780} is at once progressive
and brutal, instantaneous and interminable*. The structural caesura is
trenchant but the historical separation is slow, laborious, progressive,
imperceptible. On the issue of that double temporality, the *Essay*
again agrees with the
*Discourse.^[]{#calibre_link-759}[58](#calibre_link-415){.nounder}^*

[]{#calibre_link-44}***That "Simple Movement of the Finger." Writing and
the Prohibition of Incest*.** Society at birth is effectively subjected,
according[]{#calibre_link-3781} to the *Essay*, to a sort of law of
three conditions. But, among the "three conditions of man considered in
relation to society" (Chap. 9) or "the three different stages according
to which one can consider man assembled into a nation" (Chap. 5), only
the last marks man's access to himself within society. It is the
condition of civil and ploughing man. The two preceding states (savage
hunter and[]{#calibre_link-3782} barbaric shepherd) still belong to a
sort of prehistory. That which primarily interests Rousseau is therefore
the passage from the second into the third condition.

This passage was in fact extremely slow, uncertain, and precarious, but
since nothing in the previous state contained the structural ingredient
to produce the subsequent one, the genealogy must describe a rupture or
a reversal, a revolution[]{#calibre_link-3783} or a catastrophe.

The second *Discourse* often speaks of revolution. If the word
"catastrophe" is pronounced only once in the *Essay*, the concept is
everpresent there. And it is not, as has been said, a weakness of the
system; it is prescribed by the chain of all the other concepts.

Why is the origin of civil man, the origin of languages, etc., the
origin, in a word, of the supplementary structure,[]{#calibre_link-3784}
and, as we shall see, the origin of writing also, catastrophic? Why does
it follow an upheaval in the form of reversal, of return, of revolution,
of a progressive movement in the form of a regression?

If we follow the anthropo-geographic theme and the schema of the natural
explanation that orient the chapters on the formation of languages, it
is indeed necessary that such a catastrophe appear[]{#calibre_link-3785}
there first as []{#calibre_link-3786}a terrestrial revolution. Without
it, man would never have left the "golden centuries" of "barbarism."
Nothing within the system of barbarism could produce a force of rupture
or a reason for leaving it. The causality of the rupture had therefore
to be at once natural and exterior to the system of the precivil state.
The terrestrial revolution responds to these two exigencies.
It[]{#calibre_link-3787} is evoked at a point which is strictly the
center of the *Essay*:

The gentle climates, the fat and fertile lands, have been the first to
be inhabited and the last in which nations formed, because in them men
could do without one another more easily than elsewhere and because,
there the needs which give rise to social structures make themselves
felt later.

Supposing eternal spring on the earth;[]{#calibre_link-3788} supposing
plenty of water, livestock, and pasture, and supposing that men, as they
leave the hands of nature, were once spread out in the midst of all
that, I cannot imagine how they would ever be induced to give up their
primitive liberty, abandoning the isloated pastoral life so fitted to
their natural
indolence,^[]{#calibre_link-760}[59](#calibre_link-416){.nounder}^ to
impose upon themselves unnecessarily the labors and the inevitable
misery[]{#calibre_link-3789} of a social mode of life.

He who willed man to be social, by the touch of a finger shifted the
globe's axis into line with the axis of the universe. I see such a
*slight movement* changing the face of the earth and deciding the
vocation of mankind: in the distance I hear the joyous cries of an
insane multitude; I see the building of castles and cities; I see the
birth of the arts; I see nations[]{#calibre_link-3790} forming,
expanding, and dissolving, following each other like ocean waves; I see
men gathered together at certain points of their homeland for their
mutual development, turning the rest of the world into a hideous desert:
fitting monument to social union and the usefulness of the arts.
*\[Essay*, pp. 38--39; italics added\]

The natural indolence of the barbarian is not one empirical
characteristic[]{#calibre_link-3791} among others. It is an originary
determination indispensable to the natural system. It explains that man
could not leave barbarism and its golden century spontaneously; he did
not have within himself the motion for going further. Rest is natural.
The origin and the end are inertia. Since disturbance cannot be born out
of rest, it could not encroach upon the state of man and the
corresponding terrestrial[]{#calibre_link-3792} state, upon the
barbarian and upon perpetual spring, except through a catastrophe: the
effect of a strictly unpredictable force within the system of the world.
That is why the anthropological attribute of indolence must correspond
to the geo-logical principle of inertia.

As the catastrophe of disturbance and seasonal differentiation could not
be logically produced from within an inert system,[]{#calibre_link-3793}
one must imagine the unimaginable: a little push entirely exterior to
Nature. This apparently
"arbitrary"^[]{#calibre_link-761}[60](#calibre_link-417){.nounder}^
explanation responds to a profound necessity and thus reconciles many
exigencies. Negativity, the origin of evil, of society, of articulation,
comes *from without*. Presence is surprised by what threatens it. On
[]{#calibre_link-1043}the other hand it is imperative that this
exteriority of evil be nothing or nearly[]{#calibre_link-3794} nothing.
The little push, the "slight movement" produces a revolution out of
nothing. It suffices that the force of the person who touched the axis
of the globe with his finger should be exterior to the globe. A nearly
nonexistent force is a nearly infinite force when it is strictly alien
to the system it sets going. The system offers it no resistance; for
antagonistic forces play only within[]{#calibre_link-3795} a globe. The
slight push is almighty because it shifts the globe in the void. The
origin of evil or of history is thus nothing or nearly nothing. Thus is
explained the anonymity of Him who inclined the axis of the world with
his finger. It is *perhaps not God*, since Divine Providence, of which
Rousseau speaks so often, could not have wished the catastrophe and had
no need of chance and the void[]{#calibre_link-3796} in order to act.
But *it is perhaps God* in as much as the force of evil was nothing and
supposes no real efficiency. *It is probably* God since His eloquence
and His power are at once infinite and encounter no commensurate
resistance. Infinite power: the finger that tips a world. Eloquence
infinite because silent: a movement of the finger is enough for God to
move the world. Divine action conforms[]{#calibre_link-3797} to the
model of the most eloquent sign, that, for example, which obsesses the
*Confessions* and the *Essay*. In both texts, the example of the mute
sign is the "simple movement of the finger," the "little sign of the
finger,"^[]{#calibre_link-762}[61](#calibre_link-418){.nounder}^ a
"movement of the wand."

Finger or wand is here a metaphor. Not that it designates another thing.
It concerns God. God has no hand, he needs no organ. Organic
differentiation[]{#calibre_link-3798} is the property and the misfortune
of man. Here the silent movement does not even replace an elocution. God
has no need of a mouth to speak, nor of articulating the voice. The
*Fragment* on climates is here more emphatic than the *Essay:*

If the ecliptic had been confused with the equator, perhaps there never
would have been the emigration of peoples, and each man, not being able
to support a climate[]{#calibre_link-3799} other than his native one,
would never have left it. To tip the axis of the world with a finger or
to say to man: Cover the world and be sociable, was the same thing for
Him who needed neither hand to move nor voice to speak (p. 531).

It *certainly concerns God*, for the genealogy of evil is also a
theodicy. The catastrophic origin of societies and languages at the same
time permitted the actualization[]{#calibre_link-3800} of the potential
faculties that slept inside man. Only a fortuitous cause could actualize
natural powers which did not carry within themselves a sufficient
motivation for awakening to their own end. Teleology is in a certain way
external; it is this that the catastrophic form of archeology signifies.
So much so that between the finger giving movement out of nothing and
that auto-affection[]{#calibre_link-3801} of imagination which, as we
have seen, *awakens* itself out of nothing and then awakens all other
potentialities, []{#calibre_link-3802}there is an essential affinity.
Imagination is within Nature and yet nothing in Nature can explain its
awakening. The supplement to Nature is within Nature as its play. Who
will ever say if the lack within nature is *within* nature, if the
catastrophe by which Nature *is separated from[]{#calibre_link-3803}
itself* is still natural? A natural catastrophe conforms to laws in
order to overthrow the law.

There is something catastrophic in the movement that brings about the
emergence from the state of nature and in the awakening of the
imagination which actualizes the natural faculties and essentially
actualizes perfectibility. This is a proposition of the *Essay* whose
placing or philosophical design[]{#calibre_link-3804} is found at the
end of the first part of the *Discourse:*

Having proved that the inequality of mankind is hardly felt, and that
its influence is next to nothing in a state of nature, I must next show
its origin and trace its progress in the successive developments of the
human mind. Having shown that human *perfectibility*, the social
virtues, and the other faculties which natural man
potentially[]{#calibre_link-3805} possessed, could never develop of
themselves, but must require the fortuitous concurrence of many foreign
causes that might never arise, and without which he would have remained
for ever in his primitive condition, I must now collect and consider the
different accidents which may have improved the human understanding
while depraving the species, and made man wicked while making him
sociable; so as[]{#calibre_link-3806} to bring him and the world from
that distant period to the point at which we now behold them (p. 162)
\[p. 190\].

What we have called external teleology allows the stabilization of a
sort of discourse on method: the question of origin involves neither
event nor structure; it escapes the simple alternatives of fact and
right, of history and essence. The passage from one structure to the
other---from[]{#calibre_link-3807} the state of nature to that of
society for example---cannot be explained by any structural analysis: an
external, irrational, catastrophic factum must burst in. Chance is not
part of the system. And when history is incapable of determining this
fact or facts of this order, philosophy must, by a sort of free and
mythic invention, produce factual hypotheses playing the same role,
explaining the coming[]{#calibre_link-3808} into being of a new
structure. It would thus be abusive to reserve facts for history and
right or structure for philosophy. So simplistic a dichotomy is
intolerable to a form of the question of origin which requires the
intervention of "very slight causes" whose "power" is "surprising."

This will be a sufficient analogy for my not dwelling on the manner in
which the lapse of time compensates[]{#calibre_link-3809} for the little
probability in the events; on the surprising power of trivial causes,
when their action is constant; on the impossibility, on the one hand, of
destroying certain hypotheses, though on the other we cannot give them
the certainty of known matters of fact; on its being within the province
of history, when two facts are given as real, and have to be connected
by a series of intermediate[]{#calibre_link-3810} facts, which are
unknown or supposed to be so, to []{#calibre_link-1044}supply such facts
as may connect them; and on its being in the province of philosophy when
history is silent, to determine similar facts to serve the same end;
and, lastly, on the influence of similarity, which, in the case of
events, reduces the facts to a much smaller number of different classes
than is commonly imagined. It is enough for me[]{#calibre_link-3811} to
offer these hints to the consideration of my judges, and to have so
arranged that the general reader has no need to consider them at all
(pp. 162--63) \[pp. 190--91\].

The passage from the state of the nature to the state of language and
society, the advent of supplementarity, remains then outside the grasp
of the simple alternative of genesis and structure, of fact and
principle, of historical[]{#calibre_link-3812} and philosophical reason.
Rousseau explains the supplement in terms of a negativity perfectly
exterior to the system it comes to overturn, intervening in it therefore
in the manner of an unforeseeable factum, of a null and infinite force,
of a natural catastrophe that is neither in nor out of Nature and
remains nonrational as the origin of reason must (and not simply
irrational like an opacity within[]{#calibre_link-3813} the system of
rationality). The graphic of supplementarity is irreducible to logic,
primarily because it comprehends logic as one of its *cases* and may
alone produce its origin. Therefore the catastrophe of supplementarity,
as that which procured for Jean-Jacques the "dangerous supplement" and
the "fatal advantage" is quite---in the words of the
Confessions---"inconceivable \[to reason\]." The
possibility[]{#calibre_link-3814} of reason, of language, of society,
the *supplementary possibility, is inconceivable to reason*. The
revolution that gave birth to it cannot be understood according to the
patterns of rational necessity. The second *Discourse* speaks of the
"fatal accident"; Rousseau is in the process of evoking the
budding---barbaric---society between the state of nature and the state
of society. It is the moment of[]{#calibre_link-3815} the "perpetual
spring" of the *Essay*, "the most happy and durable epoch" of the
*Discourse*.

The more we reflect on it, the more we shall find that this state was
the least subject to revolutions, and altogether the very best man could
experience; so that he can have departed from it only through some fatal
accident, which, for the public good, should never have happened (p.
171) \[pp. 198--99\].

[]{#calibre_link-3816}What should never have happened had to come to
pass. Between these two modalities is therefore inscribed the necessity
of non-necessity, the fatality of a cruel game. The supplement can only
respond to the nonlogical logic of a game. That game is the play of the
world. The world had to be able to play freely on its axis in order that
a simple movement of the finger could make it turn upon
itself.[]{#calibre_link-3817} It is because there was play in the
movement of the globe that a force almost nonexistent could, *all at
once*, by a silent gesture, give its good or ill fortune to society,
history, language, time, relationship to the other, to death, etc. The
consequent "luck" and evil of writing will carry with them the sense of
play. But Rousseau does not []{#calibre_link-1022}*affirm* it. He
resigns himself to it, he retains its symptoms[]{#calibre_link-3818} in
the regulated contradictions of his discourse, he accepts it and refuses
it but does not affirm it. He who tipped the axis of the globe could
have been a player God, unknowingly risking the best and the worst at
the same time. But he is everywhere else determined as providence. By
this last gesture and by all that it commands in Rousseau's thought,
meaning is put out of play. As in all[]{#calibre_link-3819}
onto-theological metaphysics, as already in Plato. And the condemnation
of art, each time that it is univocal, clearly testifies to it.

If societies are born in catastrophe, it means that they are born by
accident. Rousseau naturalizes the Biblical accident: he makes a natural
accident of the Fall. But by the same token, he transforms the throw of
dice, the luck or checkmating of a player God,[]{#calibre_link-3820}
into a culpable Fall. Between the accidents of nature and social evil,
there is a complicity that, moreover, manifests Divine Providence.
Society is created only to repair the accidents of nature. Floods,
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and conflagrations no doubt terrified
savages but then made them come together "to recoup their common
losses." "\[These are\] the instruments Providence uses
to[]{#calibre_link-3821} force people to reunite" *\[Essay*, p. 40\].
The formation of societies played a compensatory role in the general
economy of the world. Born of catastrophe, society appeases unfettered
Nature. It must in its turn have that regulatory role without which the
catastrophe would have been mortal. The catastrophe itself follows an
economy. It is *contained*. "Since societies have been established,
these great[]{#calibre_link-3822} accidents have ceased, or have become
less frequent. It seems that is bound to be true even now. The same
evils that once united separated people would now tend to separate those
who are united"^[]{#calibre_link-763}[62](#calibre_link-419){.nounder}^
(Chap. 9) \[p. 40\].

Human war has the effect of reducing the war of natural elements. This
economy clearly shows that the degradation that came out of the
catastrophe must be---as we have elsewhere
verified---compensated[]{#calibre_link-3823} for, limited, regularized,
by a supplementary operation whose pattern we have outlined. "Otherwise
I do not see how the system could be kept standing and equilibrium be
maintained. In the two types of order, the greater species will finally
absorb the lesser. The entire earth would soon be covered with nothing
but trees and ferocious beasts, and finally all would perish" *\[Essay*,
p. 43\]. There[]{#calibre_link-3824} follows an admirable description of
man's work where "the hand" holds back the degradation of nature and
"retards this progress."

The catastrophe opens the play of the supplement because it inscribes
local difference. After the unity of "perpetual spring," it causes a
duality of principles to follow: the polarity and opposition of places
(North and South), the revolution of seasons which
regularly[]{#calibre_link-3825} repeats the
catastrophe;^[]{#calibre_link-764}[63](#calibre_link-420){.nounder}^ in
some ways it makes place and climate change then and there, and finally
produces the alternation of hot and cold, water and fire.

[]{#calibre_link-3826}Language and society institute themselves
following the supplementary relationship of two principles or series of
significations (North/winter/cold/need/ articulation;
South/summer/warmth/passion/accentuation).

In the North, in winter,[]{#calibre_link-3827} when it is cold, need
creates convention.

Forced to provide for winter, people living under such conditions have
to establish some sort of convention among themselves in order to help
each other. When the rigors of frigid weather make it impossible to get
about, boredom tends to unite them as much as need: the Lapps, buried in
ice, and the Eskimos, the most savage of people, huddle all
winter[]{#calibre_link-3828} in their caverns, and then in summer do not
even know each other any more. Give them somewhat greater development
and enlightenment, and there you have them united forever. *\[Essay*,
pp. 40--41\]

Fire is a substitute for natural warmth, and the men of the North must
assemble around a hearth. Not only for the cooking of meat---and man in
Rousseau's eyes is the only animal capable at the same time
of[]{#calibre_link-3829} speaking, living in society, and cooking what
he eats---but for dancing and loving.

Neither the stomach nor the intestines of man are made to digest raw
meat, nor does it usually suit his taste. With the possible single
exception of the Eskimos, of whom I have just spoken, even savages cook
their meat. To the necessary use of fire for cooking is joined the
pleasure it gives to the eye and the warmth[]{#calibre_link-3830} so
comforting to the body. The sight of the flames, from which animals
flee, is attractive to man. People gather around a common hearth where
they feast and dance; the gentle bonds of habit tend imperceptibly to
draw man closer to his own kind. And on this simple hearth burns the
sacred fire that provokes in the depths of the heart the first feeling
of humanity \[ibid.\].

In the South, the movement[]{#calibre_link-3831} is inverse, it no
longer leads from need to passion but from passion to need. And the
supplement is not the warmth of the hearth but the coolness of the water
hole:

In warm countries, unevenly distributed springs and rivers are even more
necessary rallying agents than other such factors, since people are less
able to do without water than fire. The barbarians especially, living
off their herds,[]{#calibre_link-3832} need common watering places. ...
The flowing of waters can retard the society of people inhabiting
well-irrigated places \[ibid.\].

This movement is no doubt the inverse of the preceding, but it would be
wrong to conclude that there is a symmetry. The privilege of the South
is declared. To the structure of reversibility that we have just
described, Rousseau assigns an absolute and fixed
beginning:[]{#calibre_link-3833} "the human race, born in warm lands."
Reversibility is superimposed upon the simplicity of the origin. The
warm countries are closer to the "perpetual spring" of the Golden Age.
They are more in accord with the initial inertia. Passion there is
closer to the origin, water is more in touch than fire both with the
first need and with the first passion.

[]{#calibre_link-1089}More in touch with the first need
because[]{#calibre_link-3834} "people are less able to do without water
than fire"; and more in touch with the first passion, that is to say
with love, because its "first fires" arise out of "the pure crystal of
the fountains." Thus the original language and society, as they arose in
warm countries, are absolutely pure. They are described closest to that
ineffable limit where society is formed without having begun its
degradation;[]{#calibre_link-3835} where language is instituted but
still remains pure song, a language of pure accentuation, a sort of
neume. It is no longer animal since it expresses passion, but it is not
completely conventional since it evades articulation. The origin of this
society is not a contract, it does not happen through treaties,
conventions, laws, diplomats, and *representatives*. It is a *festival
\[fête\]*. It consumes[]{#calibre_link-3836} itself in *presence*. There
is certainly an experience of time, but a time of pure presence, giving
rise neither to calculation, nor reflection, nor yet comparison: "Happy
age when nothing marked the
hours."^[]{#calibre_link-765}[64](#calibre_link-421){.nounder}^ It is
the time of the *Reveries*. Time also without differance: it leaves no
interval, authorizes no detour between desire and pleasure: "Pleasure
and desire mingled and were felt together."

[]{#calibre_link-3837}Let us read this page, no doubt the most beautiful
in the *Essay*. It is never quoted, as it should be every time the
"transparence of the
crystal"^[]{#calibre_link-766}[65](#calibre_link-422){.nounder}^ is
evoked.

... in the arid places where water could be had only from wells, people
had to rejoin one another to sink the wells, or at least to agree upon
their use. Such must have been the origin of societies and languages in
warm countries.\
That is[]{#calibre_link-3838} where the first ties were formed among
families; there were the first rendezvous of the two sexes. Girls would
come to seek water for the household, young men would come to water
their herds. There eyes, accustomed to the same sights since infancy,
began to see with increased pleasure. The heart is moved by these novel
objects; an unknown attraction renders it less savage; it feels pleasure
at not[]{#calibre_link-3839} being alone. Imperceptibly, water becomes
more necesasry. The livestock become thirsty more often. One would
arrive in haste and leave with regret. In that happy age when nothing
marked the hours, nothing would oblige one to count them; the only
measure of time would be the alternation of amusement and boredom. Under
old oaks, conquerors of the years, an ardent youth will gradually lose
its ferocity.[]{#calibre_link-3840} Little by little they become less
shy with each other. In trying to make oneself understood, one learns to
explain oneself. There too, the original festivals developed. Feet
skipped with joy, earnest gestures no longer sufficed, the voice
accompanied them in impassioned accents; pleasure and desire mingled and
were felt together. There at last was the true cradle of nations: from
the pure crystal[]{#calibre_link-3841} of the fountains flowed the first
fires of love \[pp. 44--45\].

Let us not forget: what Rousseau describes here is neither the eve of
society nor society already formed but the movement of a birth, the
continuous advent of *presence*. One must give an active and dynamic
meaning []{#calibre_link-3842}to this word. It is presence at work, in
the process of presenting itself. This presence is not a state but the
becoming-present[]{#calibre_link-3843} of presence. None of the
oppositions of determined predicates can be applied clearly to what,
between the state of nature and the state of society, is not a state but
a passage which should have continued and lasted like the present of the
*Reveries*. It is already society, passion, language, time, but it is
not yet servitude, preference, articulation, measure, and interval.
Supplementarity is possible[]{#calibre_link-3844} but nothing has yet
come into play. Rousseau's festival excludes play. The moment of the
festival is the moment of pure continuity, of in-differance between the
time of desire and the time of pleasure. Before the festival, in the
state of pure nature, there is no *experience* of the continuous; after
the festival the experience of the *discontinuous* begins; the festival
is the model of the continuous[]{#calibre_link-3845} experience. All
that we can fix in the conceptual oppositions is therefore society
formed on the morrow of the festival. And these oppositions will first
suppose the fundamental opposition of the continuous and the
discontinuous, of the original festival to the organization of society,
of the dance to law.

What follows the festival? The age of the supplement, of articulation,
of signs, of representatives.[]{#calibre_link-3846} That is the age of
the prohibition of incest. Before the festival, there was no incest
because there was no prohibition of incest and no society. After the
festival there is no more incest because it is forbidden. Rousseau
declares this, and we are going to read it. But since he says nothing
about what happens in that place during the festival, nor in what the
in-differance between desire[]{#calibre_link-3847} and pleasure
consists, we may, at least if we wish to, complete this description of
the "first festivals" and lift the interdiction that still weighs on it.

*Before the festival:*

What then! Before that time did men spring from the earth? Did
generations succeed each other without any union of the sexes, and
without anyone being understood? No: there were families, but there were
no nations. There[]{#calibre_link-3848} were domestic, but not popular,
languages. There were marriages but there was no love at all. Each
family was self-sufficient and perpetuated itself exclusively by
inbreeding. Children of the same parents grew up together and gradually
they found ways of expressing themselves to each other: the sexes became
obvious with age; natural inclination sufficed to unite them. Instinct
held the place[]{#calibre_link-3849} of passion; habit held the place of
preference. They became husband and wife without ceasing to be brother
and sister.

This nonprohibition is interrupted *after the festival*. If we have paid
attention to another lacuna, to be sure very common, we shall be very
little surprised by the omission of incest in the evocation of the
festival: describing the nonprohibition, Rousseau does not mention
the[]{#calibre_link-3850} mother at all, only the
sister.^[]{#calibre_link-767}[66](#calibre_link-423){.nounder}^ And in a
note called forth by the word "sister" Rousseau explains
[]{#calibre_link-1091}with some embarrassment that the prohibition of
incest had to follow the festival, and be born of the act of birth of
human society, and thus put upon it the seal of a *sacred* law:

The first men would have had to marry their sisters. In the simplicity
of primitive customs, this practice would easily[]{#calibre_link-3851}
perpetuate itself as long as families remained isolated, and *even after
the reunion of the most ancient peoples. But the law that prohibits it
is no less sacred for its human institution*. Those who see it only in
terms of the bond it forms among families, fail to see its most
important aspect. Given the intimacy that domestic life is bound to
establish between the two sexes, from the moment
such[]{#calibre_link-3852} *a sacred law ceased to appeal to the heart*
and mind there would be no more integrity among men and the most
terrifying practices would soon bring about the destruction of mankind
(italics added) \[pp. 45--46, n. 9\].

In general, Rousseau gives a sacred and holy character only to the
natural voice that speaks to the heart, to the natural law, which alone
is inscribed in the heart. There is *only one*[]{#calibre_link-3853}
institution, *only one* fundamental convention that is sacred in his
eyes: it is, as *The Social Contract* tells us, the social order itself,
the right of law, the convention that serves as foundation for all
conventions: "the social order is a sacred right which is the basis of
all other rights. Nevertheless, this right does not come from nature,
and must therefore be founded on conventions"
(*Social[]{#calibre_link-3854} Contract*, Bk. I, chap. I., p. 352).

Does this not justify us in placing the prohibition of incest, the law
sacred among all, on the level of that fundamental institution, of that
social order which supports and legitimizes all others? The function of
the prohibition of incest is neither named nor expounded in *The Social
Contract* but its place is marked as a blank there. Recognizing the
family[]{#calibre_link-3855} as the only "natural" society, Rousseau
specifies that it cannot maintain itself beyond biological urgencies,
except "by convention." Now between the family as natural society and
the organization of civil society, there are relationships of analogy
and corresponding image: "the ruler corresponds to the father, and the
people to the children; and all, being born free and equal, alienate
their liberty[]{#calibre_link-3856} only for their own advantage"
*\[Social Contract*, p. 4\]. One element alone breaks this analogical
rapport: the political father no longer loves his children, the element
of the law sets him apart. The first convention, which transformed the
biological family into a society of institution, has thus displaced the
figure of the father. But as the political father must, in spite of his
separation and[]{#calibre_link-3857} in spite of the abstraction of the
law he incarnates, give himself pleasure, a new investment is necessary.
It will have the form of the supplement: "The whole difference is that,
in the family, the love of the father for his children repays him for
the care he takes of them, while, in the State, the pleasure of
commanding takes the []{#calibre_link-3858}place of *\[supplée\]* the
love which the chief cannot have for the[]{#calibre_link-3859} peoples
under him" (p. 352) \[p. 4\].

One can therefore separate with difficulty the prohibition of incest
(sacred law, the *Essay* says) from the "social order," "sacred right
which is the basis for all other rights." If that holy law belongs to
the very order of the social contract, why is it not *named* in the
*exposition* of *The Social Contract?* Why does it only appear in a
footnote in an unpublished[]{#calibre_link-3860} *Essay?*

Everything in fact permits us to respect the coherence of Rousseau's
theoretical discourse by reinscribing the prohibition of incest in this
place. If it is called sacred although instituted, it is because,
although instituted, it is universal. It is the universal order of
culture. And Rousseau *consecrates* convention only on one condition:
that one might universalize it and consider it,[]{#calibre_link-3861}
even if it were the artifice of artifices, as a quasi-natural law
conforming to nature. That is exactly the case with this prohibition. It
is also the case of the order of that first and *unique* convention, of
that first unanimity to which, the *Contract* tells us "we must always
go back" (p. 359) \[p. 10\] for understanding the possibility of law.
The origin of laws must be a law.

In the note to[]{#calibre_link-3862} the *Essay* this law is obviously
not justified. It must not be explained by social circulation and the
economy of kinship laws, by "the bond it forms among families." All this
supposes the interdict but does not take it into account. What must make
us turn away from incest is described in terms where morality
("terrifying practices") and a sort of biological economy of the species
("the destruction[]{#calibre_link-3863} of mankind") mingle and are
confused. Beside the fact that these two arguments are heterogeneous if
not contradictory (it is the argument of the kettle that Freud recalls
in *The Interpretation of
Dreams),[]{#calibre_link-1196}[\*](#calibre_link-424){.nounder}* neither
of the two is intrinsically pertinent to the argument: the morality that
condemns incest is constituted from the interdict, the former has its
origin in the latter; and the biological[]{#calibre_link-3864} or
natural argument is ipso facto annulled by what we are told of the
Golden Age which preceded the interdict: generation followed generation.
"Even after the reunion of the most ancient peoples," "this practice
continued without ill-effect": this fact, which ought to limit the
universality of the sacred law, does not stop Rousseau.

Society, language, history, articulation, in a word
supplementarity,[]{#calibre_link-3865} are born at the same time as the
prohibition of incest. That last is the hinge *\[brisure\]* between
nature and culture. This statement does not name the mother in
Rousseau's text. But it shows her place all the better. The age of the
signs of institution, the epoch of the conventional relationships
between the representer and its represented belongs to the time of this
interdict.

[]{#calibre_link-3866}The natural woman[]{#calibre_link-3867} (nature,
mother, or if one wishes, sister), is a represented or a signified
replaced and supplanted, in desire, that is to say in social passion,
beyond need. She is in fact the only represented, the only signified
whose replacement by its signifier Rousseau prescribes, thus exalting
the sanctity of the interdict. Not only does he accept but he commands
that, *for once*, one comply with the sacred[]{#calibre_link-3868}
obligation of the sign, to the holy necessity of the representer. "As a
general rule---" one reads in *Emile*, "never substitute the symbol for
the thing signified, unless it is *impossible to show the thing itself;*
for the child's attention is so taken up with the symbol that he will
forget what it signifies" (pp. 189--90; italics added) \[p. 133\].

Here, then, it is impossible to show the thing,
but[]{#calibre_link-3869} this impossibility is not natural. Rousseau
himself says so; it is moreover not simply one element of culture among
others, since it is a sacred and universal interdict. It is the element
of culture itself, the undeclared origin of passion, of society, of
languages: the first supplementarity which permits the substitution in
general of a signifier for the signified, of signifiers for other
signifiers,[]{#calibre_link-3870} which subsequently makes for a
discourse on the difference between words and things. So dangerous is
this supplementarity that one can only show it indirectly, by means of
the examples of certain effects derived from it. One can neither show
it, nor name it as such, but only indicate it, by a silent movement of
the finger.

The displacing of the relationship with the mother, with nature,
with[]{#calibre_link-3871} being as the fundamental signified, such
indeed is the origin of society and languages. But can one speak of
origins after that? Is the concept of origin, or of the fundamental
signified, anything but a function, indispensable but situated,
inscribed, within the system of signification inaugurated by the
interdict? Within the play of suplementarity, one will always be able to
relate the substitutes[]{#calibre_link-3872} to their signified, this
last will be yet another signifier. The fundamental signified, the
meaning of the being represented, even less the thing itself, will never
be given us in person, outside the sign or outside play. Even that which
we say, name, describe as the prohibition of incest does not escape
play. There is a point in the system where the signifier can no longer
be replaced by its signified,[]{#calibre_link-3873} so that in
consequence no signifier can be so replaced, purely and simply. For the
point of nonreplacement is also the point of orientation for the entire
system of signification, the point where the fundamental signified is
promised as the terminal-point of all references and conceals itself as
that which would destroy at one blow the entire system of signs. It is
at once spoken and forbidden[]{#calibre_link-3874} by all signs.
Language is neither prohibition nor transgression, it couples the two
endlessly. That point does not exist, it is always elusive or, what
comes to the same thing, always already inscribed in what it ought to
escape or ought to have escaped, according to our indestructible and
mortal desire. []{#calibre_link-807}This point is reflected in the
festival, in the water hole *\[point\]* around which "feet
skipped[]{#calibre_link-3875} with joy" when "pleasure and desire
mingled and were felt together." The festival *itself* would be incest
*itself* if some such thing---*itself*---could *take place;* if, by
taking place, incest were not to confirm the prohibition: before the
prohibition, it is not incest; forbidden, it cannot become incest except
through the recognition of the prohibition. We are always short of or
beyond the limit of the[]{#calibre_link-3876} festival, of the origin of
society, of that present within which simultaneously the interdict is
(would be) given with the transgression: that which passes (comes to
pass) always and (yet) never *properly* takes place. It is always *as
if* I had committed incest.

This *birth of society* is therefore not a passage, it is a point, a
pure, fictive and unstable, ungraspable limit. One crosses it in
attaining[]{#calibre_link-3877} it. In it society is broached and is
deferred from itself. Beginning, it begins to decay. The South passes
into its own North. Transcending need, passion engenders new needs which
in turn corrupt it. Post-originary degradation is analogous to
pre-originary repetition. Articulation, substituting itself for passion,
restores the order of need. The treaty takes the place of love. Hardly
attempted,[]{#calibre_link-3878} the dance degenerates. The festival
becomes war. And already at the water hole:

The barbarians especially, living off their herds, need common watering
places. And we learn from the history of the earliest times that, in
effect, this is where both their treaties and their disputes
originated.[]{#calibre_link-1198}[\*](#calibre_link-425){.nounder}

The water hole is at the frontier of passion and need, culture and the
earth. The purity of the water[]{#calibre_link-3879} reflects the fires
of love; it is "the pure crystal of the fountains;" but water is not
only the transparency of the heart, it is also its freshness: the
body---the body of nature, of the herds and their barbaric
shepherd---needs it in its dryness: "People are less able to do without
water than fire."

If culture is thus broached within its point of origin, then it is not
possible to recognize any[]{#calibre_link-3880} linear order, whether
logical or chronological. In this broaching, what is initiated is
already corrupted, thus returning to a place before the origin. Speech
lets itself be heard and understood in the South only through
articulation, through chilling itself in order to express need anew. It
then returns to the North or, what comes to the same thing, to the south
of the South. The morrow of the festival[]{#calibre_link-3881} resembles
the eve of the festival infallibly and the point of occurrence of the
dance is only the ungraspable limit of their difference. The South and
the North are not territories but abstract places that appear only to
relate to each other []{#calibre_link-3882}in terms of each other.
Language, passion, society, are neither of the North nor of the South.
They are the movement of supplementarity by which the
poles[]{#calibre_link-3883} substitute each other *by turn:* by which
accent is broached within articulation, is deferred through spacing.
Local difference is nothing but the differance between desire and
pleasure. It does not, then, concern only the diversity of languages, it
is not only a criterion of linguistic classification, it is the origin
of languages. Rousseau does not declare it, but we have seen that he
describes[]{#calibre_link-3884} it.

From here on, I shall constantly reconfirm that writing is the other
name of this differance.

### []{#calibre_link-152 .calibre3}**4 *From/Of the Supplement to the Source: The Theory of Writing*** {#calibre_link-45 .h2}

Let us close the angle and penetrate within the text to the place where
writing is named and analyzed for itself, inscribed within theory and
placed in historical perspective. [Chapters
5](#calibre_link-27){.nounder} "On Script," and
[6](#calibre_link-31){.nounder} "Whether It Is Likely that Homer Knew
How to Write," perhaps a little artificially separated, are among the
longest in the *Essay*[]{#calibre_link-3887}, in any case the longest
after the chapter on the formation of southern languages. I have already
called attention to the alterations in the chapter on Homer: now it is a
matter of reconstituting or maintaining the coherence of the theory
against a fact which seems to threaten it. If the song, the poem, the
epic are incompatible with writing, if writing threatens them with
death, how do we explain[]{#calibre_link-3888} the coexistence of the
two ages? And that Homer knew how to write, at any rate that he knew
writing, as the episode of
Bellerophon^[]{#calibre_link-768}[1](#calibre_link-426){.nounder}^ in
the *Iliad* seems to testify? Rousseau takes note of the fact but
"stubborn in \[my\] paradoxes," he describes himself as tempted to
accuse the "compilers of Homer." Did they not write that history of
writing after the fact, introducing it violently into poems
that[]{#calibre_link-3889} "for a long time ... were written only in
men's memories?" "What is more, there are few traces of the art in the
remainder of the *Iliad*. But I venture to suggest that the whole
*Odyssey* is just a tissue of inanities and stupidities that would be
dissolved by changing a letter or two. Instead, the poem is made
reasonable and fairly continuous, by presuming that these heroes did not
know how to write.[]{#calibre_link-3890} Had the *Iliad* been written,
it would have been sung much less."

Thus a thesis without which the entire theory of language would founder
had to be saved at all costs. The sign of obstinacy which I have just
quoted shows it well: these chapters on writing are a decisive moment of
the *Essay*. In addition they introduce one of those rare themes which,
treated in the *Essay*, are absent in the second
*[]{#calibre_link-3891}Discourse;* as themes articulated into an
organized theory, absent, in fact, from all other texts.

Why did Rousseau never finish or publish a theory of writing? Because he
judged himself a bad linguist, as he says in the draft of the preface?
Because the theory of writing is rigorously dependent upon the theory of
[]{#calibre_link-1075}language developed in the *Essay?* And if it were
not so, would not this argument,[]{#calibre_link-3892} reasonably
assumed, be all the more significant? Or further, is it because the
*Essay* was supposed to be an appendix to the second *Discourse?* Or
because Rousseau, as he says in *Emile*, is "ashamed' 'to speak of the
nonsense that is writing? Why shame? What might one have invested in the
signification of writing in order to be ashamed to speak of it? to write
of it? to write it? And why is it nonsense,[]{#calibre_link-3893} this
operation in which one recognizes at the same time, notably in the
*Essay*, such dangerous and mortal powers?

At any rate the importance of these two chapters, the obstinate effort
to consolidate a theory, the laborious ruse to disqualify the interest
in writing, are signs that one may not neglect. Such is the situation of
writing within the history of metaphysics: a debased,
lateralized,[]{#calibre_link-3894} repressed, displaced theme, yet
exercising a permanent and obsessive pressure from the place where it
remains held in check. A feared writing must be cancelled because it
erases the presence of the self-same *\[propre\]* within speech.

#### ***The Originary Metaphor*** {#calibre_link-46 .h3}

This situation is reflected in the placing of the chapter "On Script" in
the *Essay*. How does Rousseau in fact construct this theory of
writing[]{#calibre_link-3895} with the help of borrowed elements? He
does it after describing the origin of languages. It is the question of
a supplement at the origin of languages. This supplement lays bare an
additive substitution, a supplement of speech. It is inserted at the
point where language begins to be articulated, is born, that is, from
falling short of itself, when its accent or intonation, marking origin
and passion[]{#calibre_link-3896} within it, is effaced under that
*other* mark of origin which is articulation. According to Rousseau, the
history of writing is indeed that of articulation. The becoming-language
of the cry is the movement by which spoken plenitude begins to become
what it is through losing itself, hollowing itself out, breaking itself,
articulating itself. The cry vocalizes itself by beginning to efface
vocalic[]{#calibre_link-3897} speech. It is indeed at the moment when it
is a question of explaining this originary effacement of what,
*properly* speaking, constitutes the spoken of speaking, that is to say
the vocalic accent, that Rousseau introduces his chapter on writing. One
must deal with the consonant---belonging to the North---and with writing
at the same time. "On Script" must first---in its first
paragraph---evoke the *obliteration*[]{#calibre_link-3898} of the accent
or intonation by consonantal articulation: *effacement* and
*substitution* at the same time. We should reread that introduction
here:

Anyone who studies the history and progress of the tongues will see that
the more the words become monotonous, the more the consonants multiply;
that, as accents fall into disuse and quantities are neutralized, they
are replaced \[*on supplée\]* by grammatical[]{#calibre_link-3899}
combinations and new articulations. But only the pressure
[]{#calibre_link-3900}of time brings these changes about. To the degree
that needs multiply, that affairs become complicated, that light is shed
\[knowledge is increased\], language changes its character. It becomes
more regular and less passionate. It substitutes ideas for feelings. It
no longer speaks to the heart but to reason. For that very reason,
accent[]{#calibre_link-3901} diminishes, articulation increases.
Language becomes more exact and clearer, but more prolix, duller and
colder. This progression seems to me entirely natural. Another way of
comparing languages and determining their relative antiquity is to
consider their script, and reason inversely from the degree of
perfection of this art. The cruder the writing, the more ancient the
language.

The progress[]{#calibre_link-3902} of writing is thus a natural
progress. And it is a progress of reason. Progress as regression is the
growth of reason as writing. Why is that dangerous progress *natural?*
No doubt because it is *necessary*. But also because necessity operates
within language and society, according to ways and powers that belong to
the state of pure *nature*. A pattern that we have already encountered:
it is need and[]{#calibre_link-3903} not passion that substitutes light
for heat, clarity for desire, precision for strength, ideas for
sentiment, reason for heart, articulation for accent. The natural, that
which was inferior and anterior to language, acts within language *after
the fact*, operates there after the origin, and provokes decadence or
regression. It then becomes the posterior seizing the superior and
dragging it toward[]{#calibre_link-3904} the inferior. Such would be the
strange time, the indescribable diagram of writing, the unrepresentable
movement of its forces and its menaces.

In what consists the *precision* and the *exactitude* of language, that
lodging of writing? Above all in *literalness \[propriété\]*. A precise
and exact language should be absolutely univocal and literal
*\[propre\]:* nonmetaphorical. The language is written,
and[]{#calibre_link-3905} pro-regresses, to the extent that it masters
or effaces the figure in itself.

Effaces, that is, its origin. For language is originarily metaphorical.
According to Rousseau it derives this from its mother, passion. Metaphor
is the characteristic that relates language to its origin. Writing would
then be the obliteration of this characteristic, the "maternal
characteristics" (cf. above, pp. 285,[]{#calibre_link-3906} 199--200).
It is therefore here that we must discuss "That the first language had
to be figurative" (Chap. 3), a proposition that is explicit only in the
*Essay*:

As man's first motives for speaking were of the passions, his first
expressions were tropes. Figurative language was the first to be born.
Proper meaning was discovered last. One calls things by their true name
only when one sees them[]{#calibre_link-3907} in their true form. At
first only poetry was spoken; there was no hint of reasoning until much
later \[p. 12\].

Epic or lyric, story or song, archaic speech is necessarily poetic.
Poetry, the first literary form, is metaphorical in essence. Rousseau
belongs therefore---he could not be otherwise, and to make note of it is
more than banal[]{#calibre_link-869}---to the tradition which determines
literary writing in terms[]{#calibre_link-3908} of the speech present in
the story or song; literary literality would be a supplementary
accessory fixing or coagulating the poem, representing the metaphor. The
literary object would have no specificity; at the most that of an
unhappy negative of the poetic. In spite of what I have said about
literary urgency as he lived it, Rousseau is at ease within this
tradition. All that one might call literary[]{#calibre_link-3909}
modernity tries on the contrary to mark literary specificity against
subjugation to the poetic, that is to say to the metaphoric, to what
Rousseau himself analyses as spontaneous language. If there is a
literary originality, which is by no means a simple certainty, it must
free itself if not from the metaphor, which tradition too has judged
reducible, at least from the savage spontaneity of
the[]{#calibre_link-3910} figure as it appears in nonliterary language.
This modern protestation can be triumphant or, in Kafka's manner,
denuded of all illusion, despairing, and no doubt more lucid:
literature, which lives by being outside of itself, within the figures
of a language which is primarily not its own, would die as well through
a reentry into itself by way of the nonmetaphor. "From a letter: 'During
this dreary[]{#calibre_link-3911} winter I warm myself by it.' Metaphors
are one among many things which make me despair of writing
*\[Schreiben\]*. Writing's lack of independence of the world, its
dependence on the maid who tends the fire, on the cat warming itself by
the stove; it is even dependent on the poor old human being warming
himself by the stove. All these are independent activities ruled by
their own laws; only writing[]{#calibre_link-3912} is helpless, cannot
live in itself, is a joke and a despair" (Kafka, *Journal*, 6 November
1921).[]{#calibre_link-1200}[\*](#calibre_link-427){.nounder}

"That the First Language Had To Be Figurative:" although this
proposition was not peculiar to Rousseau, although he might have
encountered it in
Vico,^[]{#calibre_link-769}[2](#calibre_link-428){.nounder}^ although he
must not only but surely have read it in Condillac who must not only but
surely have taken it from Warburton, we must emphasize the
originality[]{#calibre_link-3913} of the *Essay*.

"I was, perhaps, the first who discovered his abilities," says Rousseau
of Condillac, remembering their "tête-à-tête" at the moment that the
latter was "engaged upon his 'Essay sur l'Origine des connaissances
humaines' " (*Confessions*, p. 347) \[pp. 356--57\]. Rousseau is closer
to Condillac than to Warburton. *The Essay on Hieroglyphics* is
certainly governed by the theme of a language[]{#calibre_link-3914}
originarily figurative and it inspired, among other articles of the
*Encyclopaedia*, that on the metaphor, one of the richest. But unlike
Vico, Condillac,^[]{#calibre_link-770}[3](#calibre_link-429){.nounder}^
and Rousseau, Warburton thinks that the originary metaphor does not come
from "the warmth of a Poetic Fancy, as is commonly supposed." "The
Metaphor arose as evidently from the *Rusticity of
Conception*"^[]{#calibre_link-771}[4](#calibre_link-430){.nounder}^
\[Warburton, II: 147\]. If the first metaphor[]{#calibre_link-3915} is
not poetic, it is []{#calibre_link-3916}because it is not sung but acted
out. According to Warburton, one passes through a continuous transition
from a language of action to a language of speech. That will also be
Condillac's thesis. Rousseau is therefore the only one to indicate an
absolute break between the language of action or the language of need,
and speech or the language of passion. Without criticizing
Condillac[]{#calibre_link-3917} directly on this point, Rousseau opposes
him after a fashion. For Condillac, "speech succeeding the language of
action, retained its character. This new method of communicating our
thoughts could not be imagined without imitating the first. In order
then to supply the place of violent contorsions of the body, the voice
was raised and depressed by very sensible intervals" (II,I,11,Sec.
13)[]{#calibre_link-3918} \[pp. 179--80\]. This analogy and continuity
are incompatible with Rousseau's theses about the formation of languages
and local differences. For both Condillac and Rousseau the North
certainly inclines toward precision, exactitude, and rationality. But
for opposite reasons: for Rousseau the distance from the origin
increases the influence of the language of action, for Condillac it
reduces it, since[]{#calibre_link-3919} for him everything begins
through the language of action being continued within speech: "Precision
of style was much sooner received among the northern nations. In
consequence of their cold and phlegmatic constitutions, they were
readier to part with any thing that resembled the mode of speaking by
action. Every where else the influence of this manner of communicating
their thoughts subsisted a long[]{#calibre_link-3920} time. Even now, in
the southern parts of Asia, pleonasms are considered as an elegance of
speech." Sec. 67. "Style was originally poetical" (p. 149) \[p. 228\].

Condillac's position is more difficult to maintain. He must reconcile a
poetic origin (Rousseau) and a practical origin (Warburton). Through the
weaving of these difficulties and differences, Rousseau's intention
becomes precise. History[]{#calibre_link-3921} goes toward the North as
it parts from the origin. But whereas for Condillac this distancing
follows a simple, straight, and continuous line, for Rousseau it leads
to a place before the origin, toward the nonmetaphoric, the language of
needs and the language of action.

In spite of all his borrowings, all his convergences, the system of the
*Essay* thus remains original. In spite of all
difficulties,[]{#calibre_link-3922} the caesura between the gesture and
the spoken word, between need and passion, is maintained there:

It seems then that need dictated the first gestures, while the passions
wrung forth the first words. By pursuing the course of the facts with
these distinctions we may be able to see the question of the origin of
language in an entirely new light. The genius of oriental languages, the
oldest known,[]{#calibre_link-3923} absolutely refutes the assumption of
a didactic progression in their development. These languages are not at
all systematic or rational. They are vital and figurative. The language
of the first men is represented to us as the tongues of geometers, but
we see that they were the tongues of poets \[p. 11\].

[]{#calibre_link-1092}The distinction between need and passion is
justified in the last instance only by the concept[]{#calibre_link-3924}
of "pure nature." The functional necessity of this limit-concept and of
this juridical fiction also appears from this point of view. For the
essential predicate of the state of pure nature is *dispersion;* and
culture is always the effect of reconcilement, of proximity, of
self-same *\[propre\]* presence. Need, which manifests itself *in fact
before or after passion*, maintains, prolongs, or repeats
the[]{#calibre_link-3925} original dispersion. As such, and to the
extent that it is not born out of an anterior passion that modifies it,
it is the pure force of dispersion.

And so it had to be. One does not begin by reasoning, but by feeling. It
is suggested that men invented speech to express their needs: an opinion
which seems to me untenable. The natural effect of the first needs was
to separate men, and not to reunite[]{#calibre_link-3926} them. It must
have been that way, because the species spread out and the earth was
promptly populated. Otherwise mankind would have been crammed into a
small area of the world, and the rest would have remained uninhabited
\[p. 11\].

If "all of this is not true without qualification," it is because need,
structurally anterior to passion, can always in fact succeed it. But is
it only a question of[]{#calibre_link-3927} fact, of an empirical
eventuality? If the principle of dispersion remains active, is it an
accident or a residue? In fact, need is necessary to explain the eve of
society, what precedes its *constitution*, but it is indispensable in
accounting for the *extension* of society. Without need, the force of
presence and attraction would play freely, constitution would be an
absolute concentration. One would[]{#calibre_link-3928} understand how
society resists dispersion, one would no longer be able to explain how
it distributes and differentiates itself within space. The extension of
society, which can in fact lead to the dislocation of the "assembled
people," does not contribute any the less to the *organization*, the
differentiation, and the organic division of the social body. In *The
Social Contract*, the ideal dimensions[]{#calibre_link-3929} of the
city, which must be neither too small nor too large, require a certain
extension and a certain distance among citizens. Dispersion, as the law
of spacing, is therefore at once pure nature, the principle of society's
life and the principle of society's death. Thus, although the metaphoric
origin of language can be analyzed as the transcendence of need by
passion, the principle of dispersion[]{#calibre_link-3930} is not alien
to it.

In fact Rousseau cannot, as Warburton and Condillac do, allege the
continuity of the language of sounds and the language of action which
kept us back in "crude conceptions." He has to explain everything in
terms of the structure of passion and affectivity. He laboriously helps
himself out of the difficulty through a short cut that is very dense and
complex under the surface.[]{#calibre_link-3931} What is his point of
departure in that second paragraph of the third chapter?

Not the difficulty of accounting for metaphor by passion; for him that
is []{#calibre_link-3932}self-evident; but the difficulty of making the
idea---in effect surprising---of a primitively figurative language
acceptable. For do not *good* sense and good *rhetoric*, which agree in
considering the metaphor a displacement of style, require that
one[]{#calibre_link-3933} proceed from the literal *\[propre\]* meaning
in order to constitute and define the figure? Is not the figure a
transference of the literal sense? a transport? Did the theoreticians of
rhetoric known by Rousseau not define it thus? Is it not the definition
given by the
*Encyclopaedia?^[]{#calibre_link-773}[5](#calibre_link-431){.nounder}^*

To repeat the first springing forth of metaphor, Rousseau does not begin
with either good sense or rhetoric. He does[]{#calibre_link-3934} not
permit himself the use of literal meaning. And, situating himself in a
place anterior to theory and common sense, which allow the constituted
possibility of what they wish to deduce, he must show us how either
common sense or stylistic science is possible. Such is at least his
project and the original aim of his psycholinguistics of passions. But
in spite of his intention and all appearance[]{#calibre_link-3935} to
the contrary, he also *starts*, as we shall see, *from the literal
meaning. And he does so because the literal \[le propre\] must be both
at the origin and at the end*. In a word, he restores to the *expression
of emotions* a literalness whose loss he accepts, from the very origin,
in the *designation of objects*.

Here is the difficulty and the principle of solution:

However, I feel the reader stopping[]{#calibre_link-3936} me at this
point to ask how an expression can be figurative before it has a proper
meaning, since the figure consists only of a transference of meaning. I
agree with that. But, in order to understand what I mean, it is
necessary to substitute the idea that the passion presents to us for the
word that we transpose. For one only transposes words because one also
transposes ideas. Otherwise figurative[]{#calibre_link-3937} language
would signify nothing \[pp. 12--13\].

Metaphor must therefore be understood as the process of the idea or
meaning (of the signified, if one wishes) before being understood as the
play of signifiers. The idea is the signified meaning, that which the
word expresses. But it is also a sign of the thing, a representation of
the object within my mind. Finally, this representation of the
object,[]{#calibre_link-3938} signifying the object and signified by the
word or by the linguistic signifier in general, may also indirectly
signify an affect or a passion. It is in this play of the representative
idea (which is signifier or signified according to the particular
relationship) that Rousseau lodges his explanation. Before it allows
itself to be caught by verbal signs, metaphor is the relation between
signifier[]{#calibre_link-3939} and signified within the order of ideas
and things, according to what links the idea with that of which it is
the idea, that is to say, of which it is already the representative
sign. Then, the literal or proper meaning will be the relationship of
the idea to the affect that it *expresses*. And it is the *inadequation
of the designation* (metaphor) which *properly expresses* the passion.
If fear makes[]{#calibre_link-3940} me see giants where there are only
men, the signifier---as the idea of the object---will be metaphoric, but
the signifier of my passion will []{#calibre_link-882}be literal. And if
I then say "I see giants," that false designation will be a literal
expression of my fear. For in fact I see giants and there is a sure
truth there, that of a sensible cogito, analogous to what Descartes
analyzes in the *Regulae:* phenomenologically,[]{#calibre_link-3941} the
proposition "I see yellow" is unexceptionable, error becomes possible
only in the judgment "the world is
yellow."^[]{#calibre_link-774}[6](#calibre_link-432){.nounder}^

Nevertheless, what we interpret as literal expression in the perception
and designation of giants, remains a metaphor that is preceded by
nothing either in experience or in language. Since speech does not pass
through reference to an object, the fact that "giant" is literal
as[]{#calibre_link-3942} sign of fear not only does not prevent, but on
the contrary implies, that it should be nonliteral or metaphoric as sign
of the object. It cannot be the idea-sign of the passion without
presenting itself as the idea-sign of the presumed cause of that
passion, opening an exchange with the outside. This opening allows the
passage to a savage metaphor. No literal meaning precedes it. No rhetor
watches[]{#calibre_link-3943} over it.

We must therefore come back to the subjective affect, substitute the
phenomenological order of passions for the objective order of
designations, expression for indication, in order to understand the
emergence of metaphor, and the savage possibility of transference. To
the objection that the literal meaning is prior, Rousseau responds with
an example:

Upon meeting others, a savage man[]{#calibre_link-3944} will initially
be frightened. Because of his fear he sees the others as bigger and
stronger than himself. He calls them *giants*. After many experiences,
he recognizes that these so-called giants are neither bigger nor
stronger than he. Their stature does not approach the idea he had
initially attached to the word giant. So he invents another name common
to them and to him, such as the name *man*[]{#calibre_link-3945}, for
example, and leaves *giant* to the false object that had impressed him
during his illusion. That is how the figurative word is born before the
literal word, when our gaze is held in passionate fascination; and how
it is that the first idea it conveys to us is not that of the truth.
What I have said of words and names presents no difficulty relative to
the forms of phrases. The illusory image[]{#calibre_link-3946} presented
by passion is the first to appear, and the language that corresponded to
it was also the first invented. It subsequently became metaphorical when
the enlightened spirit, recognizing its first error, used the
expressions only with those passions that had produced them \[pp.
12--13\].

1\. The *Essay* thus describes at the same time the advent of the
metaphor and its "cold" recapture within[]{#calibre_link-3947} rhetoric.
One cannot, then, speak of metaphor as a figure of style, as technique
or procedure of language, except by a sort of analogy, a sort of return
and repetition of the discourse; then one deliberately passes through
the initial displacement, that which expressed the passion literally. Or
rather the representer of the passion: it is not fear itself that the
word *giant* expresses literally---and[]{#calibre_link-3948} a new
distinction []{#calibre_link-1100}is necessary which would infiltrate as
far as the literalness *\[propre\]* of expression---but "the idea that
the passion presents to us" \[*Essay*, p. 13\]. The idea "giant" is at
once the literal sign of the representer of the passion, the metaphoric
sign of the object (man) and the metaphoric sign of the affect (fear).
That sign is metaphoric because it is *false* with regard to the
object;[]{#calibre_link-3949} it is metaphoric because it is *indirect*
with regard to the affect: it is the sign of a sign, it expresses
emotion only through another sign, through the representer of fear,
namely through the *false* sign. It represents the affect literally only
through representing a false representer.

Subsequently, the rhetor or the writer can reproduce and calculate this
operation. The interval of this repetition[]{#calibre_link-3950}
separates savagery from civility; it separates them within the history
of the metaphor. Naturally, this savagery and this civility interrelate
within the condition of society opened by passion and the primitive
figures. The "enlightened spirit," the cold clarity of reason, turned
toward the North and dragging the corpse of the origin, can, having
recognized "its first error," handle metaphors[]{#calibre_link-3951} as
such, with reference to what it knows to be their true and literal
meaning. In the south of language, the impassioned spirit was caught
within metaphor: the poet relating to the world only in the style of
nonliterality. The reasoner, the writer-calculator, and the grammarian,
knowingly and coldly organize the effects of the nonliteralness of
style. But one must also turn these relationships[]{#calibre_link-3952}
inside out; the poet has a relationship of truth and literalness with
that which he expresses, he keeps himself as close as possible to his
passion. Lacking the truth of the object, he speaks himself fully and
reports authentically the origin of his speech. The rhetor accedes to
objective truth, denounces error, deals with the passions, but all by
virtue of having lost the living truth of the origin.

Thus, even while apparently affirming that the original language was
figurative, Rousseau upholds the literal *\[propre\]*: as *arche* and as
*telos*. At the origin, since the first idea of passion, its first
representer, is literally expressed. In the end, because the enlightened
spirit stabilizes the literal meaning. He does it by a process of
knowledge and *in terms of truth*. One will have
remarked[]{#calibre_link-3954} that in the last analysis, it is also in
these terms that Rousseau treats the problem. He is situated there by an
entire naive philosophy of the idea-sign.

2\. Does the example of fear come by chance? Does not the metaphoric
origin of language lead us necessarily to a situation of threat,
distress, and dereliction, to an archaic solitude, to the anguish of
dispersion? Absolute fear would then[]{#calibre_link-3955} be the first
encounter of the other as *other*: as other than I and as other than
itself. I can answer the threat of the other as other (than I) only by
transforming it into another (than itself), through altering it in my
imagination, my fear, or my desire. "Upon meeting others, a savage men
will *initially* be frightened." Fear would thus be the first passion,
[]{#calibre_link-870}the mistaken face of pity of
which[]{#calibre_link-3956} we spoke above. Pity is the force of
reconciliation and presence. Fear would still be turned toward the
immediately anterior situation of pure nature as dispersion; the other
is *first* encountered at a distance, separation and fear must be
overcome so that he may be approached as a fellow-being. From a
distance, he is immense, like a master and a threatening force. It is
the experience of the small[]{#calibre_link-3957} and silent
*\[infans\]* man. He begins to speak only out of these deforming and
naturally magnifying
perceptions.^[]{#calibre_link-775}[7](#calibre_link-433){.nounder}^ And
as the force of dispersion is never reduced, the source of fear always
compounds with its contrary.

The acknowledged influence of Condillac also makes us think that the
example of fear is not fortuitous. According to *An Essay on the Origin
of Human Knowledge*, anguish and repetition[]{#calibre_link-3958} are
the double root of language.

As for the language of action. The fact that language was given to man
by God does not forbid a search into its natural origin by a philosophic
fiction which teaches the essence of what was thus received. It does not
suffice "for a philosopher to say a thing was effected by extraordinary
means." It is "incumbent upon him to explain how it could have happened
according[]{#calibre_link-3959} to the ordinary course of nature" \[pp.
170--71\]. It is the hypothesis of the two children left in the desert
after the Flood, "before they understood the use of any
sign"^[]{#calibre_link-776}[8](#calibre_link-434){.nounder}^ \[p. 169\].
These two children began to speak only in a moment of fear: to ask for
help. But language does not begin in pure anguish or rather anguish
signifies itself only through repetition.

It is held between perception and[]{#calibre_link-3960} reflection and
is here called imitation. Let us italicize:

Thus by instinct alone they asked and gave each other assistance. I say
*by instinct alone;* for as yet there was no room for reflection. One of
them did not say to himself, I *must make such particular motions to
render him sensible of my want, and to induce him to relieve me:* nor
the other, *I see by his motions that he wants such a
thing,[]{#calibre_link-3961} and I will let him have the enjoyment
\[jouissance\] of it:* but they both acted in consequence of the want
which pressed them most. ... For example, he who saw a place in which he
had been *frightened, mimicked* those cries and movements which were the
signs of fear, in order to warn the other not to expose himself to the
same danger.^[]{#calibre_link-777}[9](#calibre_link-435){.nounder}^

3\. The work which produces the common noun supposes, like all
work,[]{#calibre_link-3962} the *chilling* and *displacement* of
passion. One can substitute the adequate common noun (*man*) for the
noun *giant* only after the appeasement of fear and the recognition of
error. With this work the number and extension of common nouns (names)
multiply. Here the *Essay* is in close accord with the second
*Discourse:* the first substantives were not common but proper
[]{#calibre_link-3963}nouns or names. The absolutely
literal[]{#calibre_link-3964} *\[propre\]* is at the origin: one sign to
a thing, one representer per passion. It is the moment when the lexical
element is as much the more extended as knowledge is
limited.^[]{#calibre_link-778}[10](#calibre_link-436){.nounder}^ But
that is true only of categoremes, a fact that ought to raise more than
one logical and linguistic difficulty. For the substantive as proper
name is not quite the first state of the language. It does not stand
alone within[]{#calibre_link-3965} the language. It already represents
an articulation and a "division of discourse." Not that, in Vico's
manner, Rousseau makes the noun be born almost at the end, after
onomatopoeia, interjections, first names, pronouns, articles, but before
verbs. The noun cannot appear without the verb. After a first step,
during which discourse is undivided, each word having "the sense of a
whole proposition,"[]{#calibre_link-3966} the noun is born at the same
time as the verb. It is the first internal rupture of the proposition
that opens discourse. There are no nouns that are not proper, no verbal
modes but the infinitive, no tense but the present: "When they began to
distinguish subject and attribute, and noun and verb, which was itself
no common effort of genius, substantives were at first only so many
proper names;[]{#calibre_link-3967} the present
infinitive^[]{#calibre_link-779}[11](#calibre_link-437){.nounder}^ was
the only tense of verbs; and the very idea of adjectives must have been
developed with great difficulty; for every adjective is an abstract
idea, and abstractions are painful and unnatural operations" (p. 149)
*\[Discourse*, p. 177\].

This correlation of the proper noun and of the infinitive present is
important for us. One thus leaves the present and the proper in
the[]{#calibre_link-3968} same movement: that which---distinguishing the
subject from subject with verb---and later distinguishing it from the
subject with its attribute---substitutes for the proper noun the common
noun and the pronoun---personal or relative---trains the classification
within a system of differences and substitutes the tenses for the
impersonal present of the infinitive.

Before this differentiation, the moment[]{#calibre_link-3969} of
languages "ignorant ... of the division of discourse" *\[Discourse*, p.
77\] corresponds to that state suspended between the state of nature and
the state of society: an epoch of natural languages, of the neume, of
the time of the Isle of St. Pierre, of the festival around the water
hole. Between prelanguage and the linguistic catastrophe instituting the
division of discourse, Rousseau attempts to[]{#calibre_link-3970}
recapture a sort of happy pause, the instantaneity of a full language,
the image stabilizing what was no more than a point of pure passage: a
language without discourse, a speech without sentence, without syntax,
without parts, without grammar, a language of pure effusion, beyond the
cry, but short of the hinge *\[brisure\]* that articulates and at the
same time disarticulates the immediate unity[]{#calibre_link-3971} of
meaning, within which the being of the subject distinguishes itself
neither from its act nor from its attributes. It is the moment when
there are words ("the words first made use of by mankind")---which do
not yet function as they do "in languages already
[]{#calibre_link-1037}formed" and in which men "first gave every single
word the sense of a whole proposition" *\[Discourse*, p. 177\]. But
language cannot be truly[]{#calibre_link-3972} born except by the
disruption and fracture of that happy plenitude, in the very instant
that this instantaneity is wrested from its fictive immediacy and put
back into movement. It serves as an absolute reference point for him who
wishes to measure and describe difference within discourse. One cannot
do it without referring to the limit, always already crossed, of an
undivided language, where the[]{#calibre_link-3973}
proper-infinitive-present is so welded to itself that it cannot even
appear in the opposition of the proper noun and the verb in the
infinitive present.

Language in its entirety, then, plunges into that breach between the
proper and the common nouns (leading to pronoun and adjective), between
the infinitive present and the multiplicity of modes and tenses. All
language will substitute itself[]{#calibre_link-3974} for that living
self-presence of the proper, which, as language, already supplanted
things in themselves. Language *adds itself* to presence and supplants
it, defers it within the indestructible desire to rejoin it.

Articulation is the dangerous supplement of fictive instantaneity and of
the good speech: of full pleasure *\[jouissance\]*, for presence is
always determined as pleasure by Rousseau. The[]{#calibre_link-3975}
present is always the present of a pleasure; and pleasure is always a
receiving of presence. What dislocates presence introduces differance
and delay, spacing between desire and pleasure. Articulated language,
knowledge and work, the anxious research of learning, are nothing but
the spacing between two pleasures. "We desire knowledge only because we
wish to enjoy" (Second *Discourse*, p. 143 \[p.[]{#calibre_link-3976}
171\]). And in *The Art of Enjoyment*, that aphorism which speaks the
symbolic restitution of the presence supplied in the past of the verb:
"Saying to myself, I enjoyed, I still
enjoy."^[]{#calibre_link-780}[12](#calibre_link-438){.nounder}^ The
great project of *The Confessions*, was it not also to "enjoy \[once
more\] ... when I desire it" (p. 585) \[p. 607\]?

#### ***The History and System of Scripts*** {#calibre_link-47 .h3}

The verb "to supplant" or "to compensate for" *\[suppléer\]*
defines[]{#calibre_link-3977} the act of writing adequately. It is the
first and the last word of the chapter "On Script." We have read its
opening paragraph. Here are the last lines:

Words *\[voix\]*, not sounds *\[sons\]*, are written. Yet, in an
inflected language, these are the sounds, the accents, and all sorts of
modulations that are the main source of energy for a language, and that
make a given phrase, otherwise quite ordinary,[]{#calibre_link-3978}
*proper only to the place where it is*. The means used *to overcome
\[suppléer\]* this weakness tend to make written language rather
elaborately prolix; []{#calibre_link-871}and many books written in.
discourse will enervate the language. To say everything as one would
write it would be merely to read aloud (italics added) \[p. **22\].**

If supplementarity is a necessarily indefinite process, writing is the
supplement par excellence[]{#calibre_link-3979} since it marks the point
where the supplement proposes itself as supplement of supplement, sign
of sign, *taking the place of* a speech already significant: it
displaces the *proper place* of the sentence, the unique time of the
sentence pronounced *hic et nunc* by an irreplaceable subject, and in
return enervates the voice. It marks the place of the initial doubling.

Between these two paragraphs:[]{#calibre_link-3980} (1) A very brief
analysis of the. diverse structures and the general growth of writing;
(2) starting from the premises of that typology and of that history, a
long reflection on alphabetic writing and an appreciation of the meaning
and value of writing in general.

Here again, in spite of massive borrowings, history and typology remain
most singular.

Warburton and Condillac propose the diagram[]{#calibre_link-3981} of an
economic, technical, and purely objective rationality. The economic
imperative must be understood here in the restrictive sense of economies
*to be made:* of *abbreviation*. Writing *reduces* the dimensions of
presence in its sign. The *miniature* is not reserved to illuminated
capitals; it is, understood in its derivative sense, the very form of
writing. The history of writing would then follow[]{#calibre_link-3982}
the continuous and linear progress of the techniques of abbreviation.
The systems of script would derive from one another without essential
modification of the fundamental structure and according to a homogeneous
and monogenetic process. One script would not replace another except to
gain more space and time. If one believes the project of "the General
History of Script" proposed by
Condillac,^[]{#calibre_link-781}[13](#calibre_link-439){.nounder}^[]{#calibre_link-3983}
writing does not have a different origin from that of speech: need and
distance. Thus it continues the language of action. But it is at the
moment that the social *distance*, which had led gesture to speech,
increases to the point of becoming *absence*, that writing becomes
necessary. (This becoming-absence of distance is not interpreted as a
rupture by Condillac but described as the consequence
of[]{#calibre_link-3984} a continuous increase.) From then on, writing
has the function of reaching *subjects* who are not only distant but
outside of the entire field of vision and beyond earshot.

Why *subjects?* Why should writing be another name for the constitution
of *subjects* and, so to speak, of *constitution* itself? of a subject,
that is to say of an individual held responsible (for) himself in front
of a law and by[]{#calibre_link-3985} the same token subject to that
law?

Under the name of writing, Condillac thinks readily of the possibility
of such a subject, and of the law mastering its absence. When the field
of []{#calibre_link-3986}society extends to the point of absence, of the
invisible, the inaudible, and the immemorable, when the local community
is dislocated to the point where individuals no longer appear to one
another, become capable[]{#calibre_link-3987} of being imperceptible,
the age of writing begins.

... laws and public transactions, together with every thing that
deserved the attention of mankind, were multiplied to such a degree,
that memory was too weak for so heavy a burden; and human societies
increased in such a manner, that the promulgation of the laws could not,
without difficulty, reach the ears of every individual. In order
therefore[]{#calibre_link-3988} to instruct the people, they were
obliged to have recourse to some new method. Then it was that writing
was invented: what progress it made I shall presently state (II. i. Sec.
73) \[p. 232\].\
When mankind had once acquired the art of communicating their
conceptions by sounds, they began to feel the necessity of inventing new
signs proper for perpetuating them, and for making them known to
absent[]{#calibre_link-3989} persons (Sec. 127) \[p.273\].

Since the operation of writing reproduces that of speech here, the first
*graphie* will reflect the first speech: figure and image. It will be
pictographic. Again a paraphrase of Warburton:

Their imaginations then represented nothing more to them than those same
images, which they had already expressed by gestures and words, and
which from the very beginning had rendered[]{#calibre_link-3990}
language figurative and metaphorical. The most natural way therefore was
to delineate the images of things. To express the idea of a man or of a
horse, they represented the form of each of these animals; so that the
first essay towards writing was a mere
picture.^[]{#calibre_link-782}[14](#calibre_link-440){.nounder}^

Like the first word, the first pictogram is therefore an image, both in
the sense of imitative representation and of metaphoric
displacement.[]{#calibre_link-3991} The interval between the thing
itself and its reproduction, however faithful, is traversed only by
transference. The first sign is determined as an image. The idea has an
essential relationship to the sign, the representative substitute of
sensation. Imagination supplements attention which supplements
perception. Attention may have for "first effect" "to make those
perceptions which are[]{#calibre_link-3992} occasioned by their objects
to continue still in the mind, when those objects are removed" (I, ii,
Sec. 17) \[p. 38\]. Imagination permits "the representation of an object
in terms of a sign, by its simple name, for example." The theory of the
sensible origin of ideas in general, the theory of signs and of
metaphoric language which commands almost all eighteenthcentury thought,
here exhibits its[]{#calibre_link-3993} Cartesian critique of
rationalism against an intact theological and metaphysical base. It is
the original sin, functioning as did the Flood in the previous examples,
which makes possible and necessary the sensationalist criticism of
innate ideas, the recourse to learning through signs or metaphors,
speech or writing, the system of signs (accidental, natural, arbitrary).
"Whenever therefore I happen[]{#calibre_link-3994} to say, *that*
[]{#calibre_link-933}*we have no ideas but what come from the senses*,
it must be remembered, that I speak only of the state into which we are
fallen by sin. This proposition applied to the soul before the fall, or
after its separation from the body, would be absolutely false. ... I
confine myself therefore, in the following work, to the present state of
humanity" (I, i, 8, p .10) \[p. 18\].

It is thus, as[]{#calibre_link-3995} with Malebranche, for example, the
very concept of experience which remains dependent on the idea of
original sin. There is one law there: the notion of experience, even
when one would like to use it to destroy metaphysics or speculation,
continues to be, in one or another point of its functioning,
fundamentally inscribed within onto-theology: at least by the value of
*presence*, whose implication[]{#calibre_link-3996} it can never reduce
by itself. Experience is always the relationship with a plenitude,
whether it be sensory simplicity or the infinite presence of God. Even
up to Hegel and Husserl, one could show, for this very reason, the
complicity of a certain sensationalism and of a certain theology. The
onto-theological idea of sensibility or experience, the opposition of
passivity and activity, constitute[]{#calibre_link-3997} a profound
homogeneity, hidden under the diversity of metaphysical systems. Within
that idea, absence and the sign always seem to make an apparent,
provisional, and derivative notch in the system of first and last
presence. They are thought as accidents and not as conditions of the
desired presence. The sign is always a sign of the Fall. Absence always
relates to distancing from God.

In order[]{#calibre_link-3998} to escape the closure of this system, it
is not enough to get rid of the "theological" hypothesis or obligation.
If he denies himself the theological facilities of Condillac when he
looks for the natural origin of society, speech, and writing, Rousseau
makes the substitutive concepts of nature or origin play an analogous
role. How can we believe that the theme of the Fall is absent from this
discourse?[]{#calibre_link-3999} How especially when we see the
disappearing finger of God appear exactly when the so-called natural
catastrophe comes about? The differences between Rousseau and Condillac
will always be contained within the same closure. One cannot state the
problem of the model of the Fall (Platonic or Judaeo-Christian) except
within this common
closure.^[]{#calibre_link-783}[15](#calibre_link-441){.nounder}^

The first writing is thus a painted image. Not
that[]{#calibre_link-4000} painting had served as writing, as miniature.
The two were at first intermingled: a closed and mute system within
which speech had as yet no right of entry and which was shielded from
all other symbolic investment. There, one had nothing but a pure
reflection of object or action. "It is in all probability to the
necessity of thus delineating our thoughts that the art of painting owes
its original;[]{#calibre_link-4001} and this necessity has doubtless
contributed to preserve the language of action, as the easiest to
represent by the pencil" (Sec. 128) \[p. 274\].

This natural writing is thus the only universal writing. The diversity
of scripts appears from the moment the threshold of pure pictography is
[]{#calibre_link-4002}crossed. That would be a simple origin. Condillac,
following Warburton in this, engenders or rather
deduces[]{#calibre_link-4003} all other types and all other stages of
writing out of this natural
system.^[]{#calibre_link-784}[16](#calibre_link-442){.nounder}^ Linear
progres will always be that of condensation, and of purely quantitative
condensation. More precisely, it will concern an objective quantity:
natural volume and space. To this profound law are submitted all
displacements and all graphic condensations that only avoid it in
appearance.

From this point of view, pictography,[]{#calibre_link-4004} the primary
method that employs one sign per thing, is the least economical. This
squandering of signs is American: "Notwithstanding the inconveniences
arising from this method, the most civilized nations in America were
incapable of inventing a better. The savages of Canada have no other"
(Sec. 129) \[p. 274\]. The superiority of hieroglyphic script---"picture
and character"---depends on the[]{#calibre_link-4005} fact that "only a
single figure \[is used\] to signify several things" \[pp. 275, 274\].
Which supposes that there might be---it is the function of the
pictographic limit---something like a unique sign for a unique thing, a
supposition contradictory to the very concept and operation of the sign.
To determine the first sign in this way, to found or deduce the entire
system of signs with reference to a sign[]{#calibre_link-4006} which
does not belong to that system, is to reduce signification to presence.
The sign from then on is nothing but a disposing of presences in the
library. The advantage of hieroglyphs---one sign for many things---is
reduced to the economy of libraries. That is what the "more ingenious"
Egyptians understood. They "were the first who made use of a shorter
method which is known by the name of
hieroglyphics."[]{#calibre_link-4007} "The inconveniency arising from
the enormous bulk of volumes, induced them to make use of only a single
figure to signify several things." The forms of displacement and
condensation differentiating the Egyptian system are comprehended within
this economic concept and conform to the "nature of the thing" (to the
nature of things) which it thus suffices to "consult." Three degrees or
three[]{#calibre_link-4008} moments: the part for the whole (two hands,
a shield, and a bow for a battle in curiologic hieroglyphs); the
instrumentreal or metaphorical---for the thing (an eye for God's
knowledge, a sword for the tyrant); finally an analogous thing, in its
totality, for the thing itself (a serpent and the medley of its spots
for the starry heavens) in tropical hieroglyphics.

According to Warburton, it was[]{#calibre_link-4009} already for
economic reasons that cursive or demotic hieroglyphics were substituted
for hieroglyphics properly speaking or for sacred writing. *Philosophy*
is the name of what precipitates this movement: economic corruption
which desacralizes through abridging and effacing the signifier for the
benefit of the signified:

But it is now Time to speak of an Alteration, which this Change of the
Subject[]{#calibre_link-4010} and Manner of Expression made in the
DELINEATION of *Hieroglyphic* []{#calibre_link-4011}*Figures*. Hitherto
the Animal or Thing representing was drawn out *graphically;* but when
the Study of Philosophy (which had occasioned *Symbolic Writing*) had
inclined their Learned to write much, and variously, that exact Manner
of Delineation would be as well too tedious as too voluminous; they
therefore by degrees perfected another[]{#calibre_link-4012} Character,
which we may call the *Running Hand* of Hieroglyphics, resembling the
*Chinese* Characters, which being at first formed only by the Outlines
of each *Figure*, became at length a kind of *Marks*. One natural Effect
that this *Running-Hand Character* would, in Time, produce, we must not
here omit to speak of; it was this, that its use would take off much of
the Attention from the *Symbol*, and fix[]{#calibre_link-4013} it on the
*Thing signified* by it; by which means the Study of *Symbolic* Writing
would be much abbreviated, there being then little to do, but to
remember the *Power* of the *Symbolic Mark;* whereas before, the
Properties of the Thing or Animal, used as a *Symbol*, were to be
learnt: In a Word, it would reduce this Writing to the present State of
the Chinese. (I: 139--40) \[Warburton, p. 115\]

This effacement[]{#calibre_link-4014} of the signifier led by degrees to
the alphabet (cf. pp. 125--26) \[pp. 109--11\]. This is also Condillac's
conclusion (Sec. 134).

It is therefore the history of knowledge---of philosophy---which,
tending to multiply books, pushes toward formalization, abbreviation,
algebra. By the same movement, separating itself from the origin, the
signifier is hollowed and desacralized, "demotized," and
universalized.[]{#calibre_link-4015} The history of writing, like the
history of science, would circulate between the two epochs of universal
writing, between two simplicities, between two forms of transparence and
univocity: an absolute pictography doubling the totality of the natural
entity in an unrestrained consumption of signifiers, and an absolutely
formal *graphie* reducing the signifying expense to almost nothing.
There would[]{#calibre_link-4016} be no history of writing and of
knowledge---one might simply say no history at all---except between
these two poles. And if history is not thinkable except between these
two limits, one cannot disqualify the mythologies of universal
script---pictography or algebra---without suspecting the concept of
history itself. If one has always thought the contrary, opposing history
to the transparence of true language,[]{#calibre_link-4017} it was no
doubt through a blindness toward the archeological or eschatological
limits, starting from which the concept of history was formed.

Science---what Warburton and Condillac call philosophy here---the
*epistémè* and eventually self-knowledge, consciousness, would therefore
be the movement of idealization: an algebrizing, de-poetizing
formalization whose operation is to repress---in order to
master[]{#calibre_link-4018} it better---the charged signifier or the
linked hieroglyph. That this movement makes it necessary to pass through
the logocentric stage is only an apparent paradox; the privilege of the
logos is that of phonetic writing, of a writing provisionally more
economical, more algebraic, by reason of a certain condition of
knowledge. The epoch of logocentrism is a moment of the global
effacement []{#calibre_link-934}of the[]{#calibre_link-4019} signifier:
one then believes one is protecting and exalting speech, one is only
fascinated by a figure of the *technè*. By the same token, one scorns
(phonetic) writing because it has the advantage of assuring greater
mastery in being effaced: in translating an (oral) signifier in the best
possible way for a more universal and more convenient time; phonic
auto-affection, dispensing with all "exterior"[]{#calibre_link-4020}
recourses, permits, at a certain epoch of the history of the world and
of what one calls man, the greatest possible mastery, the greatest
possible self-presence of life, the greatest possible liberty. It is
this history (as epoch: epoch not of history but as history) which is
closed at the same time as the form of being of the world that is called
knowledge. The concept of history is therefore[]{#calibre_link-4021} the
concept of philosophy and of the *epistémè*. Even if it was only
belatedly imposed upon what is called the history of philosophy, it was
invoked there since the beginning of that adventure. It is in a sense
unheard of until now---all idealist, or conventionally Hegelian follies
of an analogous appearance notwithstanding---that history is the history
of philosophy. Or if one prefers, here Hegel's[]{#calibre_link-4022}
formula must be taken literally: history is nothing but the history of
philosophy, absolute knowledge is fulfilled. What exceeds this closure
*is nothing:* neither the presence of being, nor meaning, neither
history nor philosophy; but another thing which has no name, which
announces itself within the thought of this closure and guides our
writing here. A writing within which philosophy is
inscribed[]{#calibre_link-4023} as a place within a text which it does
not command. Philosophy is, within writing, nothing but this movement of
writing as effacement of the signifier and the desire of presence
restored, of being, signified in its brilliance and its glory. The
evolution and properly philosophic economy of writing go therefore in
the direction of the effacing of the signifier, whether it take the form
of forgetting[]{#calibre_link-4024} or repression. Whether opposed or
associated, these two last concepts are equally inadequate. At any rate,
forgetfulness, if one understands it as the effacement of the power of
retention by *finitude*, is the very possibility of repression. And
repression, that without which dissimulation would have no *meaning*.
The concept of repression is thus, at least as much as that of
forgetting, the product[]{#calibre_link-4025} of a philosophy (of
meaning).

Whatever it might be, the movement of the retreat of the signifier, the
perfecting of writing, would free attention and consciousness (knowledge
and self-knowledge as idealization of the mastered object) for the
presence of the signified. The latter is all the more available because
it is ideal. And the value of truth in general, which always implies the
*presence*[]{#calibre_link-4026} of the signified (*aletheia* or
*adequatio*), far from dominating this movement and allowing it to be
thought, is only one of its epochs, however privileged. A European epoch
within the growth of the sign; and even, as Nietzsche, who wrenches
Warburton's proposition from its environment and its metaphysical
security, would say: of the *abbreviation of signs*. (So
[]{#calibre_link-1082}that, let it be said in
parenthesis,[]{#calibre_link-4027} in wishing to restore a *truth* and
an originary or fundamental *ontology* in the thought of Nietzsche, one
risks misunderstanding, perhaps at the expense of everything else, the
axial intention of his concept of interpretation.)

Repeating Warburton's and Condillac's statement outside its closure, one
may say that the history of philosophy is the history of prose; or
rather of the becoming-prose[]{#calibre_link-4028} of the world.
Philosophy is the invention of prose. Philosophy speaks prose, less in
excluding the poet from the city than in writing. In necessarily writing
that philosophy in which the philosopher has long believed, not knowing
what he was doing, and not knowing that a most convenient writing
permitted him to do it, and that by rights he could have been satisfied
to speak it.

In his chapter[]{#calibre_link-4029} on the "Origin of Poetry,"
Condillac calls it a *fact:* "At length a philosopher, incapable of
bending to the rules of poetry, was the first who ventured to write in
prose" (Sec. 67) \[p. 229\]. He is writing of "Pherecydes of the Isle of
Scyres ... , the first we know of who wrote in prose." Writing in the
colloquial sense is by itself prosaic. It is prose. (On that point too
Rousseau is different[]{#calibre_link-4030} from Condillac.) When
writing appears, one no longer needs rhythm and *rhyme* whose function
is, according to Condillac, to engrave meaning within memory (ibid.).
Before writing, poetry would in some way be a spontaneous engraving, a
writing before the fact. Intolerant of poetry, philosophy would have
taken writing to be a fact.

It is difficult to *appreciate* what separates Rousseau from
Warburton[]{#calibre_link-4031} and Condillac here, and to determine the
*value of the rupture. On the one hand*, Rousseau seems to refine the
models which he borrows; genetic derivation is no longer linear or
causal. He is more attentive to the *structures* of the systems of
writing in their relationship to social or economic systems and to the
figures of passion. The appearance of forms of writing is relatively
independent of[]{#calibre_link-4032} the rhythms of the history of
languages. The models of explication are in appearance less theological.
The economy of writing refers to motivations other than those of need
and action, understood in a homogeneous, simplistic, and objectivistic
sense. But *on the other hand*, he neutralizes what is irreducibly
*economic* in the system of Warburton and Condillac. And we know how the
ruses of theological[]{#calibre_link-4033} reason work within his
discourse.

Let us approach his text. To the technical and economic imperatives of
objective space, Rousseau's explication makes only one concession. It is
in order discreetly to correct Warburton's and Condillac's simplism.

It is a matter of *writing by furrows*. The furrow is the line, as the
ploughman traces it: the road---via rupta---broken by the ploughshare.
The furrow[]{#calibre_link-4034} of agriculture, we remind ourselves,
opens nature to culture (cultivation). And one also knows that writing
is born with agriculture which happens only with sedentarization.

[]{#calibre_link-4035}How does the ploughman proceed?

Economically. Arrived at the end of the furrow, he does not return to
the point of departure. He turns ox and plough around. And proceeds in
the opposite direction. Saving of time, space,[]{#calibre_link-4036} and
energy. Improvement of efficiency and reduction of working time. Writing
by the *turning of the ox---boustrophedon*---writing by furrows was a
movement in linear and phonographic
script.^[]{#calibre_link-785}[17](#calibre_link-443){.nounder}^ At the
end of the line travelled from left to right, one resumes from right to
left. Why was it abandoned at a given moment by the Greeks, for example?
Why did the economy of the writer *\[scripteur\]* break
with[]{#calibre_link-4037} that of the ploughman? Why is the space of
the one not the space of the other? If space were "objective,"
geometric, ideal, no difference in economy would be possible between the
two systems of incision.

But the space of geometric objectivity is an object or an ideal
signified produced at a moment of writing. Before it, there is no
homogeneous space, submitted to one and the same type of
technique[]{#calibre_link-4038} and economy. Before it, space orders
itself wholly for the habitation and inscription in itself of the body
"proper." There still are factors of heterogeneity inside a space to
which one and the same "proper" body relates, and therefore there are
different, indeed incompatible, economic imperatives, among which one
must choose and among which sacrifices and an organization of
hierarchies become[]{#calibre_link-4039} necessary. Thus, for example,
the surface of the page, the expanse of parchment or any other receptive
substance distributes itself differently according to whether it is a
matter of writing or reading. An original economy is prescribed each
time. In the first case, and during an entire technological era, it had
to order itself according to the system' of the hand. In the second
case, and during[]{#calibre_link-4040} the same epoch, to the system of
the eye. In both cases, it is a matter of a linear and oriented path,
the orientation of which is not indifferent and reversible in a
homogeneous milieu. In a word, it is more convenient to read than to
write by furrows. The visual economy of reading obeys a law analogous to
that of agriculture. The same thing is not true of the manual economy of
writing and the[]{#calibre_link-4041} latter was predominant during a
specific era and period of the great phonographic-linear epoch. The
fashion outlives the conditions of its necessity: it continued till the
age of printing. Our writing and our reading are still largely
determined by the movement of the hand. The printing press has not yet
liberated the organization of the surface from its immediate servitude
to the manual gesture,[]{#calibre_link-4042} and to the tool of writing.

Rousseau, therefore, was already astonished:

At first they \[the Greeks\] adopted not only the characters of the
Phoenicians, but also the direction of their lines from right to left.
Later it occurred to them to proceed as the plowman, that is, writing
alternately from left to right and right to left. Finally, they wrote
according to our present practice of starting
[]{#calibre_link-981}[]{#calibre_link-4043}each line from left to right.
This development is quite natural. Writing in the furrow fashion is
undoubtedly the most comfortable to read. I am even surprised that it
did not become the established practice with printing; but, being
difficult to write manually, it had to be abandoned as manuscripts
multiplied. \[*Essay*, p. 20\]

The space of writing is thus not an originarily *intelligible*
space.[]{#calibre_link-4044} It begins however to *become* so from the
origin, that is to say from the moment when writing, like all the work
of signs, produces repetition and therefore ideality in that space. If
one calls reading that moment which comes directly to double the
originary writing, one may say that the space of pure reading is always
already *intelligible*, that of pure writing always still *sensible*.
Provisionally,[]{#calibre_link-4045} we understand these words inside
metaphysics. But the impossibility of separating writing and reading
purely and simply disqualifies this opposition from the beginning of the
game. Maintaining it for convenience, let us nevertheless say that the
space of writing is purely sensible, in the sense that Kant intended:
space irreducibly oriented within which the left does not recover the
right. One[]{#calibre_link-4046} must also take into account the
prevalence of one direction over the other within the movement. For here
it is the question of an operation, not just of a perception. The two
sides are never symmetrical from the point of view of the aptitude or
simply the activity of the body proper.

Thus the "return of the ox" is less suitable for writing than reading.
Between these two economic prescriptions[]{#calibre_link-4047} the
solution will be a labile compromise which will leave residues, entail
inequalities of development and useless expenses. Compromise, if one
wishes, between the eye and the hand. During the age of this
transaction, one does not only write, one reads a little blindly, guided
by the order of the hand.

Should one still recall everything that such an economic necessity made
possible?

This compromise[]{#calibre_link-4048} is already very derivative, a late
arrival, if one remembers that it prevails only at a moment when a
certain type of writing, itself charged with history, was already
practiced: linear phonography. The system of speech, of
hearing-oneself-speak, auto-affection that seems to suspend all
borrowing of signifiers from the world and thus to render itself
universal and transparent to the signified,[]{#calibre_link-4049} the
*phonè* which seems to guide the hand, was never able to precede its
system nor, in its very essence, to be alien to it. It could only
represent itself as order and predominance of a temporal linearity by
*seeing* itself or rather *handling* itself, within its own
self-reading. *It is not enough to say that the eye or the hands speak.
Already, within its own representation, the voice is seen
and[]{#calibre_link-4050} maintained*. The concept of linear temporality
is only one *way* of speech. This form of successivity is in return
imposed upon the *phonè*, upon consciousness and upon preconsciousness
from a certain determined space of its inscription.
[]{#calibre_link-967}For the voice is always already invested, undone
*\[sollicitée\]*, required, and marked in its essence by a certain
spatiality.^[]{#calibre_link-786}[18](#calibre_link-444){.nounder}^

When I say a form is *imposed*, I obviously[]{#calibre_link-4051} do not
think of any classical model of causality. The question, so often asked,
of knowing if one writes as one speaks or speaks as one writes, if one
reads as one writes or conversely, refers in its banality to an
historical or prehistoric depth more hidden than is generally suspected.
Finally, if one notes that the place of writing is linked, as Rousseau
had intuited, to the nature of social[]{#calibre_link-4052} space, to
the perceptive and dynamic organization of the technical, religious,
economic and other such spaces, one realizes the difficulty of a
transcendental question on space. A new transcendental aesthetic must
let itself be guided not only by mathematical idealities but by the
possibility of inscriptions in general, not befalling an already
constituted space as a contingent accident but
producing[]{#calibre_link-4053} the spatiality of space. Indeed we say
of inscription *in general*, in order to make it quite clear that it is
not simply the notation of a prepared speech representing itself, but
inscription within speech and inscription as *habitation* always already
situated. Such a questioning, in spite of its reference to a form of
fundamental passivity, ought no longer to call itself a transcendental
*aesthetic*[]{#calibre_link-4054}, neither in the Kantian, nor in the
Husserlian, sense of those words. A transcendental question on space
concerns the prehistoric and precultural level of spatio-temporal
experience which furnishes a unitary and universal ground for all
subjectivity, and all culture, this side of empirical diversity, as well
as the orientations proper to their spaces and their times. Now if one
lets oneself be[]{#calibre_link-4055} guided by inscription as
habitation in general, the Husserlian radicalization of the Kantian
question is indispensible but insufficient. We know that Husserl
reproached Kant for having allowed himself to be guided in his question
by ideal objects already constituted into a science (geometry or
mechanics). To a constituted ideal space a subjectivity constituted
(into faculties) corresponded naturally.[]{#calibre_link-4056} And from
my present point of view, there is much to say on the concept of the
*line* which so often intervenes in the Kantian critique. (Time, the
form of all sensible phenomena, internal *and* external, seems to
dominate space, the form of external sensible phenomena; but it is a
time that one may always represent by a line and the "refutation of
idealism" will reverse that order.) The Husserlian[]{#calibre_link-4057}
project not only put all objective space of science within parentheses,
it had to articulate aesthetics upon a transcendental kinesthetics.
Nevertheless, in spite of the Kantian revolution and the discovery of
*pure* sensibility (free of all reference to sensation), to the extent
that the concept of sensibility (as pure passivity) and its contrary
will continue to dominate such questions, they
will[]{#calibre_link-4058} remain imprisoned in metaphysics. If the
space-time that we inhabit is *a priori* the space-time of the trace,
there is neither pure activity nor pure passivity. This pair of
concepts---and we know that Husserl erased one with the
[]{#calibre_link-970}other constantly---belongs to the myth of the
origin of an uninhabited world, of a world alien to the trace: pure
presence of the pure present, that one may either call
purity[]{#calibre_link-4059} of life or purity of death: determination
of being which has always superintended not only theological and
metaphysical but also transcendental questions, whether conceived in
terms of scholastic theology or in a Kantian and post-Kantian sense. The
Husserlian project of a transcendental aesthetics, of a restoration of
the "logos of the aesthetic world" (*Formal and Transcendental
Logic*)[]{#calibre_link-1202}[\*](#calibre_link-445){.nounder}
remains[]{#calibre_link-4060} subjected to the instance of the *living
present*, as to the universal and absolute form of experience. It is by
what complicates this privilege and escapes it that we are opened to the
space of inscription.

Breaking with linear genesis and describing the correlations among
systems of script, social structures, and the figures of passion,
Rousseau opens his questions in the direction that I
have[]{#calibre_link-4061} indicated.

Three states of man in society: three systems of writing, three forms of
social organization, three types of passion. "These three ways of
writing correspond almost exactly to three different stages according to
which one can consider men gathered into a nation" *\[Essay*, p. 16\].
Among these three manners, there are no doubt differences of "crudity"
and "antiquity." But in as much as[]{#calibre_link-4062} they can assure
a chronological and linear localization, they interest Rousseau but
little. Many systems may coexist, a cruder system may appear after a
more refined system.

Here too all begins with painting. That is to say with savagery: "The
primitive way of writing was not to represent sounds, but objects
themselves." Is this painting satisfied with reproducing the thing? Does
it correspond[]{#calibre_link-4063} to that universal proto-writing that
redoubles nature without any displacement? Here the first complication
is introduced. In effect Rousseau distinguishes between two
pictographies. One proceeds *directly* and the other *allegorically*,
"whether directly as with the Mexicans, or by allegorical imagery, as
previously the Egyptians did" \[p. 17\]. And when he links them thus:
"This stage corresponds[]{#calibre_link-4064} to passionate language,
and already supposes some society and some needs to which the passions
have given birth," he doe not designate the sole "Egyptian" or
"allegorical" state with any verisimilitude. Without which it would be
necessary to conclude that a writing---direct pictography---could have
existed in a society without passion, which is contrary to the premises
of the *Essay*. On the other hand,[]{#calibre_link-4065} how should one
imagine a direct, proper, unallegorical painting in a state of passion?
That too is contrary to the premises.

One cannot overcome this alternative without reinstating something
unsaid: pure representation without metaphoric displacement, the purely
reflecting kind of painting, is the first figure. In it the thing most
faithfully []{#calibre_link-1026}represented is already no longer
properly present.[]{#calibre_link-4066} The project of repeating the
thing already corresponds to a social passion and therefore requires a
metaphoricity, an elementary transference. One transports the thing
within its double (that is to say already within an ideality) for an
other, and the perfect representation is always already other than what
it doubles and re-presents. Allegory begins there. "Direct" painting is
already allegoric[]{#calibre_link-4067} and impassioned. That is why
there is no *true* writing. The duplication of the thing in the
painting, and already in the brilliance of the phenomenon where it is
present, guarded and regarded, maintained, however slightly, facing the
regard and under the regard, opens appearance as the absence of the
thing in its self-sameness *\[propre\]* and its truth. There is never a
painting of the thing itself[]{#calibre_link-4068} and first of all
because there is no thing itself. If we suppose that writing had a
primitive and pictorial stage, it would emphasize this absence, this
evil, or this resource which forever shapes and undermines the truth of
the phenomenon; produces it and of course substitutes it. The original
possibility of the image is the supplement; which adds itself without
adding anything to fill an emptiness[]{#calibre_link-4069} which, within
fullness, begs to be replaced. Writing as painting is thus at once the
*evil* and the *remedy* within the *phainesthai* or the *eidos*. Plato
already said that the art or technique (*technè*) of writing was a
*pharmakon* (drug or tincture, salutary or maleficent). And the
disquieting part of writing had already been experienced in its
resemblance to painting. Writing is *like* painting, like
the[]{#calibre_link-4070} *zoographeme*, which is itself determined (cf.
*Cratylus*, 430--32) within a problematic of *mimesis;* resemblance is
troubling: "I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is
unfortunately like painting" (*zoographia*) (275d). Here
painting---zoography---betrays being and speech, words and things
themselves because it freezes them. Its offshoots seem to be living
things but when one questions them, they[]{#calibre_link-4071} no longer
respond. Zoography has brought death. The same goes for writing. No one,
and certainly not the father, is there when one questions. Rousseau
would approve without reservations. Writing carries death. One could
play on this: writing as zoography as that painting of the living which
stabilizes animality, is, according to Rousseau, the writing of savages.
Who are also, as we know, only hunters:[]{#calibre_link-4072} men of the
*zoogreia*, of the capture of the living. Writing would indeed be the
pictorial representation of the hunted beast: magical capture and
murder.

Another difficulty in this concept of proto-writing: no recourse to
convention is made there. The latter appears only in the "second way":
moment of barbarism and of the ideogram. The hunter paints beings, the
shepherd already inscribes languages:[]{#calibre_link-4073} "The second
way is to represent words and propositions by conventional characters.
That can be done only when the language is completely formed and an
entire people is united by common laws; for this already presupposes a
twofold convention. Such is the []{#calibre_link-4074}writing of the
Chinese; it truly represents sounds and speaks to the eyes" \[*Essay*,
p. 17\].

One may conclude from this that, in the first
state,[]{#calibre_link-4075} metaphor did not give rise to any
convention. Allegory was still a savage production. There was no need of
institutions to represent beings themselves and metaphor here was the
transition between nature and institution. Then the protowriting which
did not paint language but painted things could make shift with a
language, therefore with a society which was not at all "completely
formed." This first[]{#calibre_link-4076} stage is always that unstable
limit of birth: one has left "pure nature" but one has not completely
reached the state of society. The Mexicans and the Egyptians would have
the right, according to Rousseau, to only "some society."

The second manner paints sounds but without splitting up words and
propositions. It would thus be ideo-phonographic. Each signifier would
refer to a phonic totality[]{#calibre_link-4077} and a conceptual
synthesis, to a complex and global unity of sense and sound. One has not
yet attained purely phonographic writing (of the alphabetic types, for
example) in which the visible signifier refers to a phonic unity which
in itself has no sense.

It is perhaps for this reason that the ideo-phonogram presupposes a
"twofold convention:" that which links the grapheme to its phonematic
signified,[]{#calibre_link-4078} and that which links this phonematic
signified, as a signifier, to its signified sense, to its concept, if
one wishes. But in that context, "twofold convention" might also
mean---it is less probable---something else: linguistic *and* social
convention. ("That can be done only when the language is completely
formed and an entire people is united by common laws.") One does not
need institutional laws[]{#calibre_link-4079} for being understood
through the paintings of things and of natural beings, but one needs
them for stabilizing the rules of the painting of sounds and of the
unity of words and ideas.

However, Rousseau calls "barbaric" the nations capable of these "common
laws" and this "twofold convention." The use of the concept of barbarity
in the *Essay* is very disconcerting. Often (in [Chapters
4](#calibre_link-24){.nounder} and [9](#calibre_link-52){.nounder})
Rousseau[]{#calibre_link-4080} makes it function in a perfectly
deliberate, rigorous, and systematic way: three states of society, three
languages, three scripts (savage/barbaric/civil;
hunter/shepherd/ploughman; pictography/ideo-phonography/analytical
phonography). Yet elsewhere, an apparently looser use of the word
(certainly of the word "barbarity" if not of "barbaric") designates
again a state of dispersion, whether[]{#calibre_link-4081} it be of pure
nature or of domestic structure. Note 2 of Chapter 9 calls "savages"
those whose barbarity is subsequently described: "Apply these ideas to
primitive men and you will see the reason for their barbarity. ... These
barbaric times were a golden age, not because men were united, but
because they were separated. ... Scattered over the vast wilderness of
the world, men would relapse into the
[]{#calibre_link-4082}[]{#calibre_link-4083}stupid barbarism in which
they would be if they were born of the earth" *\[Essay*, pp. 33, 36\].
Domestic-barbaric society had no language. Familial idiom is not a
language. "Living almost without society, widely scattered, hardly
speaking at all, how could they write?" Is not this sentence in flagrant
contradiction with the attribution, in [Chapter
4](#calibre_link-288){.nounder}, of a script and even of a twofold
convention to[]{#calibre_link-4084} barbaric peoples?

No commentary can, it seems, efface this contradiction. An
interpretation may attempt it. It would consist, uncovering a profound
level of literality while neutralizing another one more superficial, of
searching then within Rousseau's text for the right to isolate
relatively the structure of the graphic system from the structure of the
social system. Although the social and[]{#calibre_link-4085} graphic
types correspond ideally and by analogy, a society of the civil type may
have *in fact* a writing of the barbaric type. Although barbarians
hardly speak and do not write, one finds the characteristics of a
certain writing within barbarity. In saying thus that "the depicting of
objects is appropriate to a savage people; signs of words and of
propositions, to a barbaric people, and the
alphabet[]{#calibre_link-4086} to civilized peoples *\[peuples
policés\]"* \[*Essay*, p. 17\], one does not contravene the structural
principle, rather one confirms it. In our society, where the civil type
has appeared, the elements of pictographic writing would be savage, the
ideo-phonographic elements barbaric. And who would deny the presence of
all these elements in our practice of writing?

For even while maintaining the principle[]{#calibre_link-4087} of
structural analogy, Rousseau insists nonetheless on preserving the
relative independence of social, linguistic, and graphic structures. He
will say it further on: "The art of writing does not at all depend upon
that of speaking. It derives from needs of a different kind which
develop earlier or later according to circumstances entirely independent
of the duration of the people, and which might[]{#calibre_link-4088}
never have occurred in very old nations" \[p. 19\].

The *fact* of the appearance of writing is therefore not necessary. And
it is this empirical contingency which allows the putting in parenthesis
of the fact in structural or eidetic analysis. That a structure whose
internal organization and essential necessity we know should appear in
fact here or there, sooner or later, is, as I have noted
elsewhere,[]{#calibre_link-4089} the condition and the limit of a
structural analysis as such and in its proper moment. In its proper
instance, attention to the internal specificity of the organization
always leaves to chance the passage from one structure to another. This
chance may be thought, as it is here the case, negatively as
catastrophe, or affirmatively as play. This structuralist limit and
power has an ethico-metaphysical[]{#calibre_link-4090} convenience.
Writing in general, as the emergence of a new system of inscription, is
a supplement of which one would wish to learn only the *additive* aspect
(it *happens unexpectedly, at a stroke \[sur-venu d'un coup\]*, into the
bargain) and the *noxious* influence (arrives *ill-advisedly, in
addition []{#calibre_link-1088}\[mal-venu, en plus\]*, from the
exterior, when nothing in the conditions of its past made it
necessary).[]{#calibre_link-4091} Not to attribute any necessity to its
historical appearance is at once to ignore the appeal of substitution
and to think evil as a surprising, exterior, irrational, accidental and
therefore effaceable addition.

#### ***The Alphabet and Absolute Representation*** {#calibre_link-48 .h3}

Thus graphics and politics refer to one another according to complex
laws. They must thus both clothe the form of reason as a process of
degradation[]{#calibre_link-4092} which, between two universalities and
from catastrophe to catastrophe, *should* return to a total
reappropriation of presence. *Should \[devrait\]:* it is the mode and
tense of a teleological and eschatological anticipation that
superintends Rousseau's entire discourse. Thinking differance and
supplementarity in this mode and tense, Rousseau wishes to announce them
from the horizon of their final effacement.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-4093}
:::

In this sense, in the order of writing as in the order of the city, as
long as the absolute reappropriation of
man^[]{#calibre_link-787}[19](#calibre_link-446){.nounder}^ in his
presence is not accomplished, the worst is simultaneously the best. The
furthest in the time of lost presence is closest to the time of presence
regained.

Hence the third condition: civil man and alphabetic writing. It is here
that, in the most conspicuous and grave manner,[]{#calibre_link-4094}
law supplements nature and writing speech. In one case as in the other,
the supplement is representation. We recall the fragment on
[]{#calibre_link-4095}[]{#calibre_link-4096}*Pronunciation:*

Languages are made to be spoken, writing is nothing but a *supplement*
of speech. ... The analysis of thought is made through speech, and the
analysis of speech through writing; speech *represents* thought through
conventional signs, and writing represents speech in the same way; thus
the art of writing is nothing but a mediated *representation* of
thought, at least in the case of vocalic[]{#calibre_link-4097}
languages, the only ones that we use.

The movement of supplementary representation approaches the origin as it
distances itself from it. Total alienation is the total reappropriation
of self-presence. Alphabetic writing, representing a representer,
supplement of a supplement, increases the *power* of representation. In
losing a little more presence, it restores it a little bit better. More
purely[]{#calibre_link-4098} phonographic than the writing of the second
condition, it is more apt to fade before the voice, more apt to let the
voice be. Within the political order---total alienation, that which
develops, as *The Social Contract* says, "without reserve"---"we gain
the exact equivalent of what we lose, as well as an added power to
conserve what we already have" (Bk. I, p. 361) \[p. 181\]. On condition,
of course,[]{#calibre_link-4099} that the emergence out of the anterior
state---at the limit, from the []{#calibre_link-1084}state of pure
nature---does not make it fall back, as is always possible, short of the
origin, and consequently if "the misuse of the new conditions still, at
times, degrades him \[the human being\] to a point below that from which
he has emerged" (p. 364) \[p. 185\].

Unreserved alienation is thus unreserved representation. It
wrenches[]{#calibre_link-4100} presence absolutely from itself and
absolutely re-presents it to itself. Since evil always has the form of
representative alienation, of representation in its dispossessing
aspect, all Rousseau's thought is in one sense a critique of
representation, as much in the linguistic as in the political sense. But
at the same time---and here the entire history of metaphysics is
reflected---this critique depends[]{#calibre_link-4101} upon the naivete
of representation. It supposes at once that representation follows a
first presence and restores a final presence. One does not ask how much
of presence and how much of representation are found within presence. In
criticizing representation as the loss of presence, in expecting a
reappropriation of presence from it, in making it an accident or a
means, one situates oneself[]{#calibre_link-4102} within the
self-evidence of the distinction between presentation and
representation, within the *effect* of this fission. One criticizes the
sign by placing oneself within the selfevidence and the effect of the
difference between signified and signifier. That is to say, without
thinking (quite like those later critics who, from within the same
*effect*, reverse the pattern, and oppose a logic of
the[]{#calibre_link-4103} representer to the logic of the represented)
of the productive movement of the effect of difference: the strange
graphic of differance.

It is therefore not at all surprising that the third condition (civil
society and alphabet) should be described according to the patterns that
are as much those of *The Social Contract* as those of the *Letter to
d'Alembert*.

Praise of the "assembled people" at[]{#calibre_link-4104} the festival
or at the political forum is always a critique of representation. The
legitimizing instance, in the city as in language---speech or
writing---and in the arts, is the representer present in person: source
of legitimacy and sacred origin. Perversity consists precisely in
sacralizing the representer or the signifier. Sovereignty is presence,
and the delight in *\[jouissance\]* presence. "The[]{#calibre_link-4105}
moment the people is legitimately assembled as a sovereign body, the
jurisdiction of the government wholly lapses, the executive power is
suspended, and the person of the meanest citizen is as sacred and
inviolable as that of the first magistrate; for in the presence of the
person represented, representatives no longer exist" (*Social Contract*,
pp. 427--29 \[p. 76\].

In all the orders, the possibility[]{#calibre_link-4106} of the
representer befalls represented presence as evil befalls good, or
history befalls origin. The signifier-representer is the catastrophe.
Therefore it is always "new" in itself, in whatever epoch it might
appear. It is the essence of modernity. "The idea of representation is
modern," is a proposition which must be extended beyond the limits that
Rousseau assigns it (p. 430) \[p. 78\]. Political[]{#calibre_link-4107}
liberty is full only []{#calibre_link-1003}at the moment when the power
of the representer is suspended and given back to the represented: "In
any case, the moment a people allows itself to be represented, it is no
longer free: it no longer exists" (p. 431) \[p. 80\].

It is necessary, then, to reach the point where the source is held
within itself, where it returns or reascends toward itself in the
inalienable immediacy[]{#calibre_link-4108} of self-possession
*\[jouissance de soi\]*, in the moment of the impossible representation,
in its sovereignty. In the political order, that source is determined as
will: "Sovereignty, for the same reason as makes it inalienable, cannot
be represented; it lies essentially in the general will, and will does
not admit of representation: it is either the same, or other; there is
no intermediate possibility"[]{#calibre_link-4109} (p. 429) \[p. 78\].
"... The Sovereign, who is no less than a collective being, cannot be
represented except by himself: the power indeed may be transmitted, but
not the will" (p. 368) \[p. 20\].

As corruptive principle, the representative is not the represented but
only the representer of the represented; it is not the same as itself.
As representer, it is not simply the other of the
represented.[]{#calibre_link-4110} The evil of the representer or of the
supplement of presence is neither the same nor the other. It intervenes
at the moment of differance, when the sovereign will delegates itself,
and when, in consequence, law is written. Now the general will risks
becoming a transmitted power, a particular will, preference, inequality.
The decree, that is to say writing, can be substituted for the law; in
the decrees[]{#calibre_link-4111} representing particular wills, "the
general will becomes mute" (*Social Contract*, p. 438) \[p. 86\]. The
system of the social contract, which founds itself on the existence of a
moment anterior to writing and representation, can, however, not avoid
allowing itself to be threatened by the letter. That is why, obliged to
have recourse to representation, "the body politic, as well as the human
body,[]{#calibre_link-4112} begins to die as soon as it is born, and
carries in itself the causes of its destruction" (p. 424 \[p. 73\]
Chapter 11 of Bk. III, "Of the Death of the Body Politic," opens all the
developments of representation). Writing is the origin of
inequality.^[]{#calibre_link-788}[20](#calibre_link-447){.nounder}^ It
is the moment when the *general will* which cannot err by itself, gives
way to *judgment*, which can draw it into "the seductive influences of
individual[]{#calibre_link-4113} wills" (p. 380) \[p. 31\]. One must
therefore separate legislative sovereignty from the power of *drawing
up* laws. "When Lycurgus gave laws to his country, he began by resigning
the throne." "He, therefore, who draws up the laws has, or should have,
no right of legislation, and the people cannot, even if it wishes,
deprive itself of this incommunicable right" (pp. 382--83)
\[pp.32--33\]. It is therefore[]{#calibre_link-4114} absolutely
necessary that the general will express itself through *voices* without
proxy. It "makes law" when it *declares* itself in the voice of the
"body of the people" where it is indivisible; otherwise it is divided
into particular wills, acts of magistracy, decrees (p. 369) \[p. 21\].

But the catastrophe that interrupted the state of nature opens the
movement of distancing which brings closer;[]{#calibre_link-4115}
perfect representation should represent []{#calibre_link-935}perfectly.
It restores presence and effaces itself as absolute representation. This
movement is
necessary.^[]{#calibre_link-789}[21](#calibre_link-448){.nounder}^ The
telos of the image is it own imperceptibility. When the perfect image
ceases to be other than the thing, it respects the thing and restores
originary presence. Indefinite cycle: represented source of
representation, the origin of the image can[]{#calibre_link-4116} in
turn represent its representers, replace its substitutes, supply its
supplements. Folded, returning to itself, representing itself,
sovereign, presence is then---and barely---only the supplement of a
supplement. It is thus that the *Discourse on Political Economy* defines
"the general will, the *source and supplement* of all laws, \[which\]
should be consulted whenever they fail" (p. 250; italics
added)[]{#calibre_link-4117} \[p.
242\].[]{#calibre_link-1204}[\*](#calibre_link-449){.nounder} Is not the
order of pure law, which gives back to the people their liberty and to
presence its sovereignty, always the supplement of a natural order
somewhere deficient? When the supplement accomplishes its office and
fills the lack, there is no harm done. The abyss is the chasm which can
remain open between the lapse of Nature and *the delay of the
supplement:* "The time of man's most[]{#calibre_link-4118} shameful
lawlessness and greatest misery was when, new passions having smothered
natural sentiments, human understanding had not yet made sufficient
progress to substitute maxims of sagacity for natural
impulses."^[]{#calibre_link-790}[22](#calibre_link-450){.nounder}^ The
play of the supplement is indefinite. References refer to references.
The general will, that "celestial voice" (*Discourse on Political
Economy*, p. 248) \[p. 240\] is therefore the[]{#calibre_link-4119}
supplement of nature. But when, by a return of catastrophe, society is
degraded, nature can substitute itself for its supplement. It is then a
bad nature, "it is under these circumstances that the voice of duty no
longer speaks in men's hearts, and their rulers are obliged to
*substitute* the cry of terror, or the lure of an apparent *interest"*
(p. 253; italics added) \[p. 245\].

This play of the[]{#calibre_link-4120} supplement, the always open
possibility of a catastrophic regression and the annulment of progress,
recalls not only Vico's *ricorsi*. Conjugated with what we have called
geometric regression, it makes history escape an infinite teleology of
the Hegelian type. In a certain way, considering that history can always
interrupt its own progress, (and must even progress in regression),
(re)turn behind[]{#calibre_link-4121} itself, Rousseau does not make
"the work of death," the play of difference and the operation of
negativity, serve in the dialectical accomplishment of truth within the
horizon of parousia. But all these propositions may be inverted. This
finitism of Rousseau emerges also on the basis of a providentialist
theology. Interpreting itself, it effaces itself on another level as it
reduces the historic[]{#calibre_link-4122} and negative to the
accidental. It too is thought within the horizon of an infinite
restitution of presence, and so on. In the closed field of metaphysics,
what []{#calibre_link-4123}I outline here as an indefinite exchange of
"Rousseauist" and "Hegelian" positions (one might take many other
examples) obeys the laws inscribed within all the concepts that I have
just recalled. It is possible to formalize these
laws[]{#calibre_link-4124} and indeed they are formalized.

What I have just noted within the political order is applicable also to
the graphic order.

Access to phonetic writing constitutes at once a supplementary degree of
representativity and a total revolution in the structure of
representation. Direct or hieroglyphic pictography represents the thing
or the signified. The ideo-phonogram already represents a
mixture[]{#calibre_link-4125} of signifier and signified. It already
paints language. It is the moment located by all historians of writing
as the birth of phoneticization, through, for example, the picture
puzzle *\[rebus a
transfert\];^[]{#calibre_link-791}[23](#calibre_link-451){.nounder}^* a
sign representing a thing named in its concept ceases to refer to the
concept and keeps only the value of a phonic signifier. Its signified is
no longer anything but a phoneme deprived by[]{#calibre_link-4126}
itself of all meaning. But before this decomposition and in spite of the
"twofold convention," representation is reproduction; it repeats the
signifying and signified masses en bloc and without analysis. This
synthetic character of representation is the pictographic residue of the
ideo-phonogram that "paints voices." Phonetic writing works to reduce
it. Instead of using signifiers immediately
related[]{#calibre_link-4127} to a conceptual signified, it uses,
through the analysis of sounds, signifiers that are in some way
nonsignifying. Letters, which have no meaning by themselves, signify
only the elementary phonic signifiers that make sense only when they are
put together according to certain rules.

Analysis substituting painting and pushed to insignificance, such is the
rationality proper to the alphabet and[]{#calibre_link-4128} to civil
society. Absolute anonymity of the representer and absolute loss of the
selfsame *\[le propre\]*. The culture of the alphabet and the appearance
of civilized man *\[l'homme policé\]* correspond to the age of the
ploughman. And let us not forget that agriculture presupposes industry.
But then, how can we explain the allusion to the trader who is in fact
never named in the classification of the[]{#calibre_link-4129} three
conditions and thus seems to have no appropriate era?

The third \[way of writing\] is to break down the speaking voice into a
given number of elementary parts, either vocal or articulate \[vowels or
consonants\], with which one can form all the words and syllables
imaginable. This way of writing, which is ours, must have been invented
by commercial peoples who, in traveling to various
countries,[]{#calibre_link-4130} had to speak various languages, which
would have impelled them to invent characters that could be common to
all of them. This is not exactly to depict speech, but to analyze it
\[p. 17\].

The trader invents a system of graphic signs which in its principle is
no longer attached to a particular language. This writing may in
principle inscribe []{#calibre_link-4131}all languages in general. It
gains in universality, it[]{#calibre_link-4132} favors trade and makes
communication "with other people who \[speak\] other languages" \[p.
17\] easier. But it is perfectly enslaved to language in general the
moment it liberates itself from all particular languages. It is, in its
principle, a universal phonetic writing. Its neutral transparence allows
each language its proper form and its liberty. Alphabetic writing
concerns itself only with pure[]{#calibre_link-4133} representers. It is
a system of signifiers where the signifieds are signifiers: phonemes.
The circulation of signs is infinitely facilitated. Alphabetic writing
is the mutest possible, for it does not speak any language immediately.
But, alien to the voice, it is more faithful to it and represents it
better.

This independence with regard to the empirical diversity of oral
languages confirms a[]{#calibre_link-4134} certain autonomy of the
growth of writing. Writing may not only be born earlier or later,
independently of the "duration of the people," slowly or at one
stroke;^[]{#calibre_link-792}[24](#calibre_link-452){.nounder}^ in
addition, it implies no linguistic derivation. This is truer of the
alphabet, bound to no particular language, than of other systems. One
may thus borrow graphic signs, make them safely emigrate outside of
their culture and their[]{#calibre_link-4135} language of origin. "But
though the Greek alphabet derives from the Phoenoecian, it does not
follow at all that the Greek language derives from the Phoenoecian" \[p.
20\].

This movement of analytic abstraction in the circulation of arbitrary
signs is quite parallel to that within which money is constituted. Money
replaces things by their signs, not only within a society but from one
culture to[]{#calibre_link-4136} another, or from one economic
organization to another. That is why the alphabet is commercial, a
trader. It must be understood within the monetary moment of economic
rationality. The critical description of money is the faithful
reflection of the discourse on writing. In both cases an anonymous
supplement is substituted for the thing. Just as the concept retains
only the comparable element of diverse[]{#calibre_link-4137} things,
just as money gives the "common
measure"^[]{#calibre_link-793}[25](#calibre_link-453){.nounder}^ to
incommensurable objects in order to constitute them into merchandise, so
alphabetic writing transcribes heterogeneous signifieds within a system
of arbitrary and common signifiers: the living languages. It thus opens
an aggression against the life that it makes circulate. If "the sign has
led to the neglect of the thing signified," as
*Emile^[]{#calibre_link-794}[26](#calibre_link-454){.nounder}^*[]{#calibre_link-4138}
says speaking of money, then the forgetfulness of things is greatest in
the usage of those perfectly abstract and arbitrary signs that are money
and phonetic writing.

Following the same graphic, the alphabet introduces a supplementary
degree of representativity which marks the progress of analytic
rationality. This time, the element brought to light is a pure signifier
(purely arbitrary), in[]{#calibre_link-4139} itself nonsignifying. This
nonsignification is the negative, abstract, and formal aspect of
universality or rationality. The value of such a writing
[]{#calibre_link-1023}is therefore ambiguous. There was a natural
universality of a sort in the most archaic degree of writing: painting,
as much as the alphabet, is not tied to any determined language. Capable
of reproducing all sensible being, it is a sort of
universal[]{#calibre_link-4140} writing. But its liberty with reference
to languages is due not to the distance which separates painting from
its model but to the imitative proximity which binds them. Under a
universal appearance, painting would thus be perfectly empirical,
multiple, and changeful like the sensory units that it represents
outside of any code. By contrast, the ideal universality of phonetic
writing is due to its[]{#calibre_link-4141} infinite distance with
respect to the sound (the primary signified of that writing which marks
it arbitrarily) and to the meaning signified by the spoken word. Between
these two poles, universality is lost. I say between these two poles
since, as I have confirmed, pure pictography and pure phonography are
two ideas of reason. Ideas of pure presence: in the first case, presence
of the represented[]{#calibre_link-4142} thing in its perfect imitation,
and in the second, the self-presence of speech itself. In both cases,
the signifier tends to be effaced in the presence of the signified.

This ambiguity characterizes the evaluation that all metaphysics has
imposed upon its own writing since Plato. Rousseau's text belongs to
this history, articulating one of its remarkable epochs. More rational,
more exact, more[]{#calibre_link-4143} precise, more clear, the writing
of the voice corresponds to a more efficient civil order. But in so far
as it effaces itself better than another before the possible presence of
the voice, it represents it better and permits it to be absent with the
smallest loss. Faithful servant of speech, it is preferred to writings
used by other societies, but as a slave is preferred to a barbarian,
fearing[]{#calibre_link-4144} it at the same time as a machine of death.

For its rationality distances it from passion and song, that is to say
from the living origin of language. It progresses with the consonant.
Corresponding to a better organization of social institutions, it also
gives the means of more easily doing without the sovereign presence of
the assembled people. It tends to restore natural dispersion.
Writing[]{#calibre_link-4145} naturalizes culture. It is that
precultural force which is at work as articulation within culture,
working to efface a difference which it has opened. Political
rationality---the rationality of fact, and not the rationality whose
principle *The Social Contract* describes---favors writing and
dispersion at the same time and in the same movement.

The propagation of writing, the teaching of its
rules,[]{#calibre_link-4146} the production of its instruments and
objects, are considered by Rousseau to be an enterprise of political
enslavement. That is what one also reads in *Tristes Tropiques*. Certain
governments are interested in having languages muzzled, thus ensuring
that one no longer speak to the soverign people. The abuse of writing is
a political abuse. The latter is rather the "reason" of the former:

[]{#calibre_link-4147}language,[]{#calibre_link-4148} perfecting itself
in books, is corrupted in discourse. It is clearer when one writes,
duller when one speaks, syntax is purified and harmony is lost, French
becomes more philosophic and less eloquent day by day, soon it will be
good only for reading and all its value will be in libraries.

The reason for this abuse lies, as I have submited elsewhere \[in the
last chapter of the *Essay*\], in the form[]{#calibre_link-4149} that
governments have taken and which results in our having nothing to say to
others except the least interesting things in the world and things that
they care least to understand: sermons, academic discourses. Fragment on
Pronunciation (pp. 1249--50)

Political decentralization, dispersion, and decentering of sovereignty
calls, paradoxically, for the existence of a capital, a center of
usurpation[]{#calibre_link-4150} and of substitution. In opposition to
the autarchic cities of Antiquity, which were their own centers and
conversed in the living voice, the modern capital is always a monopoly
of writing. It commands by written laws, decrees, and literature. Such
is Paris's role as Rousseau sees it in the text on *Pronunciation*. Let
us not forget that *The Social Contract* judged the exercise of the
sovereignty[]{#calibre_link-4151} of a people and the existence of a
capital incompatible. And as in the case of representatives, if it was
impossible not to have recourse to them, it was at least necessary to
remedy that evil by changing them often. Which amounts to recharging
writing with the living voice: "Nevertheless, if the State cannot be
reduced to the right limits, there remains still one resource; this is,
to allow no capital,[]{#calibre_link-4152} to make the seat of
government move from town to town, and to assemble by turn in each the
Provincial Estates of the
country"^[]{#calibre_link-795}[27](#calibre_link-455){.nounder}^ (p.
427) \[p. 76\]. The instance of writing must be effaced to the point
where a sovereign people *must not even write to itself*, its assemblies
must meet spontaneously, without "any formal summons" \[p. 75\]. Which
implies---and that is a writing that Rousseau does not
wish[]{#calibre_link-4153} to read---that there were "fixed and
periodic" assemblies that "cannot be abrogated or prorogued," and
therefore a "marked day *\[jour marqué\]."* That mark had to be made
orally since the moment the possibility of writing were introduced into
the operation, it would insinuate usurpation into the body of society.
But is not a mark, wherever it is produced, the possibility of writing?

the Theater

The history of the voice and its writing is comprehended between two
mute writings, between two poles of universality relating to each other
as the natural and the artificial: the pictogram and algebra. The
relationship of natural to artificial or arbitrary is itself subject to
the law of "extremes" which "touch one another." And if Rousseau
suspects alphabetic writing without condemning[]{#calibre_link-4155} it
absolutely, it is because there are worse. []{#calibre_link-880}It is
structurally but the next to the last step of that history. Its artifice
has a limit. Unbound to any particular language, it yet refers to the
*phonè* or language in general. As phonetic writing, it keeps an
essential relationship to the presence of a speaking subject *in
general*, to a transcendental locutor, to the voice as the self-presence
of[]{#calibre_link-4156} a life which hears itself speak. In that sense,
phonetic writing is not absolute evil. It is not the letter of death.
Nevertheless, it announces death. To the extent that that writing
progresses with consonantic chilling, it allows the anticipation of the
ice, speech degree zero: the disappearance of the vowel, the writing of
a dead language. The consonant, which is easier to write than the
vowel,[]{#calibre_link-4157} initiates this end of speech in the
universal writing, in algebra:

It would be easy to construct a language consisting solely of
consonants, which could be written clearly but not spoken. Algebra has
something of such a language. When the orthography of a language is
clearer than its pronunciation, this is a sign that it is written more
than it is spoken. This may have been true of the
scholarly[]{#calibre_link-4158} language of the Egyptians; as is the
case for us with the dead languages. In those burdened with useless
consonants, writing seems to have preceded speech: and who would doubt
that such is the case with Polish? \[*Essay*\], Chap. 7 \[p. 28\]

The universal characteristic, writing become purely conventional through
having broken all links with the spoken language---such then would be
absolute evil. With[]{#calibre_link-4159} the *Logic of Port-Royal*,
Locke's *Essay*, Malebranche, and Descartes, Leibniz was one of
Rousseau's primary philosophic
readings.^[]{#calibre_link-796}[28](#calibre_link-456){.nounder}^ He is
not cited in the *Essay* but in the fragment on *Pronunciation*. With as
much suspicion as the "art of Raymond Lully" in *Emile* (p. 575) \[p.
425\].

Languages are made to be spoken, writing serves only as supplement to
speech; if there are some languages that are only[]{#calibre_link-4160}
written, and that one cannot speak, belonging only to the sciences, it
would be of no use in civil life. Such is algebra, such was no doubt the
universal language that Leibniz looked for. It would probably have been
more useful to a Metaphysician than to an Artisan (p. 1249).

The universal writing of science would thus be absolute alienation. The
autonomy of the representer becomes absurd: it[]{#calibre_link-4161} has
attained its limit and broken with all representeds, with all living
origin, with all living present. In it supplementarity is accomplished,
that is to say emptied. The supplement, which is neither simply the
signifier nor simply the representer, does not take the place of a
signified or a represented, as is prescribed by the concepts of
signification or representation or by the syntax of
the[]{#calibre_link-4162} words "signifier" or "representer." The
supplement comes in the place of a lapse, a nonsignified or a
nonrepresented, a nonpresence. There is no present before it, it is not
preceding by anything but itself, that is to say by another
[]{#calibre_link-992}supplement. The supplement is always the supplement
of a supplement. One wishes to go back *from the supplement to the
source:* one must recognize that there is *a
supplement[]{#calibre_link-4163} at the source*.

Thus it is always already algebraic. In its writing, the visble
signifier, has always already begun to seperate itself from speech and
to supplant it. The nonphonetic and universal writing of science is also
in that sense a *theorem*. It is enough to look in order to calculate.
As Leibniz said, *"ad vocem referri non est necesse."*

Through that silent and mortal glance the
complicities[]{#calibre_link-4164} of science and politics are
exchanged: more precisely of modern political science. "The letter
killeth" (*Emile*, p. 226) \[p. 159\].

Where should one search, in the city, for that lost unity of glance and
speech? In what *space* can one again *listen to himself?* Can the
theater, which unites spectacle and discourse, not take up where the
unanimous assembly left off? "For a long time now one
speaks[]{#calibre_link-4165} in public only through books, and if one
says something in person to the public that interests it, it is in the
theater" (*Pronunciation*, p. 1250).

But the theater itself is shaped and undermined by the profound evil of
representation. It is that corruption itself. For the stage is not
threatened by anything but itself. Theatrical representation, in the
sense of exposition, of production, of that[]{#calibre_link-4166} which
is placed out there (that which the German *Darstellung* translates) is
contaminated by supplementary re-presentation. The latter is inscribed
in the structure of representation, in the space of the stage. Let us
not be mistaken, what Rousseau criticizes in the last analysis is not
the content of the spectacle, the sense *represented* by it, although
that *too* he criticizes: it is re-presentation[]{#calibre_link-4167}
itself. Exactly as within the political order, the menace has the shape
of the representative.

In fact, after having evoked the misdeeds of the theater considered in
the content of what it stages, in its *represented*, the *Letter to
d'Alembert* incriminates representation and the *representer:* "Beyond
these effects of the theatre, which are relative to what is *performed
\[representées\]*, there are[]{#calibre_link-4168} others *no less
necessary* which relate directly to the *stage* and to the *persons who
perform \[representants\];* and it is to them that the previously
mentioned Genevans attribute the taste for luxury, adornment, and
dissipation, whose introduction among us they rightly
fear."^[]{#calibre_link-797}[29](#calibre_link-457){.nounder}^
Immorality, then, attaches, to the very status of the representer
(performer). Vice is his natural bent. It is normal
that[]{#calibre_link-4169} he who has taken up representation as a
profession should have a taste for external and artificial signifiers,
and for the perverse use of signs. Luxury, fine clothes, and dissipation
are not signifiers incidentally coming about here and there, they are
the crimes of the signifier or the representer itself.

Double consequence:

[]{#calibre_link-1083}1. There are two sorts of public persons, two men
of spectacle: on[]{#calibre_link-4170} the one hand the orator or
preacher, on the other the actor. The former represents himself, in him
the representer and the represented are one. But the actor is born out
of the rift between the representer and the represented. Like the
alphabetic signifier, like the letter, the actor himself is not inspired
or animated by any particular language. He signifies nothing. He hardly
lives, he lends his[]{#calibre_link-4171} voice. It is a mouthpiece. Of
course the difference between the orator or preacher and the actor
presupposes that the former does his duty, says what he has to say. If
they do not assume ethical responsibility for their word, they become
actors, hardly even actors, for the latter make a duty of saying what
they do not think:

The orator and the preacher, it could be said, make use of their
persons[]{#calibre_link-4172} as does the actor. The difference is,
however, very great. When the orator appears in public, it is to speak
and not to show himself off; he *represents only himself:* he fills only
his own proper role, speaks only in his own name, says, or ought to say,
only what he thinks; *the man and the role being the same* \[being\]
*\[étant le même être\]*, he is *in his place;* he is in the situation
of any citizen[]{#calibre_link-4173} who fulfils the functions of his
estate. But an actor on the stage, displaying other sentiments than his
own, saying only what he is made to say, *often representing a
chimerical being*, annihilates himself, as it were, and is lost in his
hero. And, in this forgetting of the man, if something remains of him,
it is used as the plaything of the spectators (p. 187; italics added)
\[pp. 80--81\].

It is[]{#calibre_link-4174} the best possible situation: the actor
accepts the role and loves what he incarnates. The situation may be
still worse. "What shall I say of those who seem to be afraid of having
too much merit as they are and who degrade themselves to the point of
playing characters whom they would be quite distressed to resemble?"
\[p. 81\].

The identity of the representer and the represented may be
accomplished[]{#calibre_link-4175} in two ways. The better way: by the
effacement of the representer and the personal presence of the
represented (the orator, the preacher); or the worse way: it is not
illustrated by the actor alone (representer emptied of what he
represents) but by a certain society, that of the worldly Parisians who
have, in order to find themselves there, alienated themselves in a
certain theater, theater of[]{#calibre_link-4176} a theater, play
representing the comedy of that society. "It is nevertheless solely for
these people that theatrical entertainments are made. They are
represented by fictitious characters in the middle of the theater, and
show themselves in real ones on each side; they are at once persons of
the drama on the stage, and comedians in the boxes" (*La Nouvelle
Héloise*, p.
252).[]{#calibre_link-1206}[\*](#calibre_link-458){.nounder} This total
alienation[]{#calibre_link-4177} of the represented within
[]{#calibre_link-1085}the representer is the negative aspect of the
social pact. In both cases, the represented is reappropriated when he is
lost without reserve in his representation. In what terms should the
elusive difference which separates the positive from the negative
aspect, the authentic social pact from a forever-perverted theater, from
a *theatrical* society, be defined?

**2.** The signifier[]{#calibre_link-4178} is the death of the festival.
The innocence of the public spectacle, the good festival, the dance
around the water hole, would open a theater without representation. Or
rather a stage without a show: without *theater*, with nothing to see.
Visibility---a moment ago the theorem, here the theatre---is always that
which, separating it from itself, breaches *\[entame\]* the living
voice.

But what is a stage[]{#calibre_link-4179} which presents nothing to the
sight? It is the place where the spectator, presenting himself as
spectacle, will no longer be either seer \[*voyant*\] or voyeur, will
efface within himself the difference between the actor and the
spectator, the represented and the representer, the object seen and the
seeing subject. With that difference, an entire series of oppositions
will deconstitute themselves[]{#calibre_link-4180} one by one. Presence
will be full, not as an object which is *present* to be seen, to give
itself to intuition as an empirical unit or as an *eidos* holding itself
*in front of* or *up against;* it will be full as the intimacy of a
self-presence, as the consciousness or the sentiment of self-proximity,
of self-sameness *\[propriété\]*. That public festival will therefore
have a form analogous to the electoral[]{#calibre_link-4181} meetings of
a free and legiferant assembled people: the representative differance
will be effaced in the selfpresence of sovereignty. "The exaltation of
the collective festival has the same structure as the general will of
*The Social Contract*. The description of *public joy* gives us the
lyrical aspect of the general will: it is the aspect that it assumes in
its Sunday
best."^[]{#calibre_link-798}[30](#calibre_link-459){.nounder}^ The text
is well[]{#calibre_link-4182} known. It recalls the evocation of the
festival in the *Essay*. Let us reread it in order to recognize the
desire of making *representation* disappear, with all- the meanings that
converge in that word: delay and delegation, repetition of a present in
its sign or its concept, the proposition or opposition of a show, an
object to be seen:

What! Ought there to be no entertainments in a republic?
On[]{#calibre_link-4183} the contrary, there ought to be many. It is in
republics that they were born, it is in their bosom that they are seen
to flourish with a truly festive air. *\[Letter to d'Alembert*, p. 125\]

These innocent spectacles will take place outdoors and they will have
nothing "effeminate" or "mercenary" about them. The sign, money, ruse,
passivity, and servility will be excluded from them. No one will
use[]{#calibre_link-4184} anyone, no one will be an object for anyone.
There will no longer be, after a certain fashion, anything to see:

[]{#calibre_link-829}But what then will be the objects of these
entertainments? What will be shown in them? Nothing, if you please. With
liberty, wherever abundance reigns, well-being also reigns. Plant a
stake crowned with flowers in the middle of a square; gather the people
together there, and you will[]{#calibre_link-4185} have a festival. Do
better yet; let the spectators become an entertainment to themselves;
make them actors themselves; do it so that each sees and loves himself
in the others so that all will be better united. *Letter to M.
d'Alembert*, pp. 224--25 \[p. 126\]

We must note that this festival without object is also a festival
without sacrifice, without expense, and without play. Above all without
masks.^[]{#calibre_link-799}[31](#calibre_link-460){.nounder}^[]{#calibre_link-4186}
It has no outside although it takes place out of doors. It maintains
itself in a purely interior relation to itself. "So that each sees and
loves himself in the others." In a certain way, it is confined and
sheltered, whereas the hall of the theater, wrenched away from itself by
the games and detours of representation, diverted from itself and torn
by differance, multiplies the outside in itself.[]{#calibre_link-4187}
There are many *games \[jeux\]* within the public festival but no *play
\[jeu\]* at all, if one understands by that singular number the
substitution of contents, the exchange of presences and absences, chance
and absolute risk. That festival represses the relationship with death;
what was not necessarily implied in the description of the enclosed
theatre. These analyses can turn in both directions.

[]{#calibre_link-4188}At any rate, play is so much absent from the
festival that the dance is admitted as the initiation into marriage and
is contained within the closure of the ball. Such is at least the
interpretation to which Rousseau submits, to fix it carefully, the
meaning of his text on the festival. One could make him say quite a
different thing. And Rousseau's text must constantly be considered as a
complex and[]{#calibre_link-4189} many-leveled structure; in it, certain
propositions may be read as interpretations of other propositions that
we are, up to a certain point and with certain precautions, free to read
otherwise. Rousseau says A, then for reasons that we must determine, he
interprets A into B. A, which was already an interpretation, is
reinterpreted into B. After taking cognizance of it, we may, without
leaving Rousseau's[]{#calibre_link-4190} text, isolate A from its
interpretation into B, and discover possibilities and resources there
that indeed belong to Rousseau's text, but were not produced or
exploited by him, which, for equally legible motives, he *preferred to
cut short* by a gesture neither witting nor unwitting. In his
description of the festival, for example, there are propositions which
could very well have been interpreted[]{#calibre_link-4191} in the sense
of Antonin
Artaud's^[]{#calibre_link-800}[32](#calibre_link-461){.nounder}^ theater
of cruelty or of the festival and sovereignty of which Georges Bataille
has proposed the concepts. But these propositions are interpreted
otherwise by Rousseau himself, who transforms play into games and the
dance into a ball, expense into presence.

What ball are we speaking of here? To understand that, one must first
[]{#calibre_link-4192}understand the praise of the
open[]{#calibre_link-4193} air. The open air is undoubtedly Nature and
in that respect it must lead Rousseau's thoughts in a thousand ways,
through all the themes of pedagogy, promenade, botany, and so on. But
more precisely, the open air is the element of the voice, the liberty of
a breath that nothing breaks into pieces. A voice that can make itself
heard in the open air is a free voice, a clear voice that the
northern[]{#calibre_link-4194} principle has not yet muzzled with
consonants, not yet broken, articulated, compartmentalized, and which
can reach the interlocutor immediately. The open air is frankness, the
absence of evasions, of representative mediations among living spoken
words. It is the element of the Greek city, "the great concern" of which
was "its liberty." The north limits the possibilities of the open air:
"Your severer[]{#calibre_link-4195} climates add to your needs; for half
the year your public squares are uninhabitable; *the flatness of your
languages unfits them for being heard in the open air;* you sacrifice
more for profit than for liberty, and fear slavery less than poverty"
(*The Social Contract*, p. 431) \[p. 79; italics added\]. Once again the
northern influence is pernicious. But a northern man must live like a
northerner.[]{#calibre_link-4196} To adopt or adapt southern customs in
the North is pure folly and worse servitude (ibid.). One must therefore
find substitutes in the North or in winter. The winter substitute of the
festival is our dance for young brides-to-be. Rousseau recommends the
practice: unequivocally and as he himself says, without scruple; and
what he says of winter illuminates after a fashion what he might have
said of[]{#calibre_link-4197} summer.

Winter, a time consecrated to the private association of friends, is
less appropriate to public festivals. There is, however, one sort
concerning which I wish there were not so many scrupulous doubts raised,
that is, the balls for young marriageable persons. I have never
understood why people are so worried about dancing and the gatherings it
occasions, as if there were something worse[]{#calibre_link-4198} about
dancing than singing, as if these amusements were not both equally an
inspiration of nature, as if it were a crime for those who are destined
to be united to be merry together in a decent recreation. Man and woman
were formed for one another. God wants them to fulfill their destiny,
and certainly the first and holiest of all the bonds of society is
marriage.^[]{#calibre_link-801}[33](#calibre_link-462){.nounder}^

One should comment word by[]{#calibre_link-4199} word on the long and
edifying discourse that follows. A hinge articulates the entire
argument: the full daylight of presence avoids the dangerous supplement.
One must allow pleasures to "a lively and frolicsome youth" to avoid
their "substituting more dangerous ones" and to prevent "private
meetings adroitly concerted \[from\] tak\[ing\] the place of public
gatherings." "Innocent joy is likely to evaporate[]{#calibre_link-4200}
in the full light of day; but vice is a friend of shadows" (*Letter to
M. d'Alembert*, p. 227) \[p. 129\]. Furthermore, the nudity that
presents the body itself is less dangerous than the recourse to
sartorial signifiers, to the northern supplement,
[]{#calibre_link-1045}to "artful dress": the latter is not "less
dangerous than an absolute nudity the habit of which would soon turn the
first effects into indifference and[]{#calibre_link-4201} perhaps
distaste." "Is it not known that statues and paintings only offend the
eyes when a mixture of clothing renders the nudity obscene? The
immediate power of the senses is weak and limited; it is through the
intermediary of the imagination that they make their greatest ravages;
it is the business of the imagination to irritate the desires" (p. 232)
\[p. 134\]. It will have been noticed that
representation---the[]{#calibre_link-4202} picture---rather than
perception, is chosen to illustrate the danger of the supplement whose
efficiency is the imagination. And it will then be noticed that, in a
note inserted into the heart of this praise of marriage, anticipating
the errors of posterity, Rousseau makes only one exception to his
denials:

It is something amusing for me to imagine the judgments that many will
make of my tastes[]{#calibre_link-4203} on the basic of my writings. On
the basis of this one they will not fail to say: "that man is crazy
about dancing"; it bores me to watch dancing; "he cannot bear the
drama"; I love the drama passionately; "he has an aversion to women"; on
that score I shall be only too easily vindicated (p. 229) \[p. 131n\].

Thus the North, winter, death, imagination, representation, the
irritation of desires---this[]{#calibre_link-4204} entire series of
supplementary significations---does not designate a natural place or
fixed terms: rather a periodicity. Seasons. In the order of time, or
rather like time itself, they speak the movement by which the presence
of the present separates from itself, supplants itself, replaces itself
by absenting itself, produces itself in self-substitution. It is this
that the metaphysics of presence[]{#calibre_link-4205} as self-proximity
wishes to efface by giving a privileged position to a sort of absolute
now, the *life* of the present, the living present. The coldness of
representation not only breaks self-presence but also the originarity of
the present as the absolute form of temporality.

This metaphysics of presence constantly reappears and is resumed in
Rousseau's text whenever the fatality of the
supplement[]{#calibre_link-4206} seems to limit it. It is always
necessary to add a supplement of presence to the presence that is
concealed. "The great remedy to the miseries of this world" is
"absorption into the present moment," says Rousseau in *The Solitaries*.
The present is originary, that is to say the determination of origin
always has the form of presence. Birth is the birth (of) presence.
Before it there is no presence;[]{#calibre_link-4207} and from the
moment that presence, holding or announcing itself to itself, breaches
its plenitude and starts the chain of its history, death's work has
begun. Birth in general is written as Rousseau describes his own: "I
cost my mother her life; and my birth was the first of my misfortunes"
(*Confessions*, p. 7) \[p. 5\]. Every time that Rousseau tries to
recapture an essence (in the form of an origin,[]{#calibre_link-4208} a
right, an ideal limit), he always leads us back to a point of full
presence. He is less interested in the present, in the being
[]{#calibre_link-1090}present, than in the presence of the present, in
its essence as it appears to itself and is retained in itself. Essence
is presence. As life, that is as selfpresence, it is birth. And just as
the present goes out of itself only to return to itself, a rebirth is
possible[]{#calibre_link-4209} which, furthermore, is the only thing
that permits all the repetitions of origin. Rousseau's discourse and
questions are possible only in the anticipation of a rebirth or a
reactivation of the origin. Rebirth, resurrection, or reawakening always
appropriate to themselves, in their fugitive immediacy, the plenitude of
presence returning to itself.

That return to the presence of the origin is
produced[]{#calibre_link-4210} after each catastrophe, at least in so
far as it *reverses* the order of life without destroying it. After a
divine finger had *turned* the order of the world *over \[renversé\]* by
inclining the axis of the globe on the axis of the universe and had thus
willed that "men \[be\] sociable," the festival around the water hole
was possible and pleasure was immediately present to desire. After a
"great Danish[]{#calibre_link-4211} dog" had *knocked* Jean-Jacques
*over \[renversé\]* in the second *Promenade;* when after "the fall"
which had *precipitated* him ("my head was thrown down lower than my
feet") it was first necesasry to *recount* to him the "accident" that he
had not been able to experience; when he explains to us what happened at
the moment when, he says twice, "I came to myself," "I came back to
consciousness,"---it is indeed[]{#calibre_link-4212} awakening as
re-awakening to pure presence that he describes, always according to the
same model: not anticipation, not memory, not comparison, not
distinction, not articulation, not situation. Imagination, memory, and
signs are effaced. All landmarks on the physical or psychical landscape
are natural.

The state in which I found myself in that instant was too singular not
to make a description[]{#calibre_link-4213} of it here.

The night was coming on. I perceived the sky, some stars, and a little
grass. This first sensation was a delicious moment. I did not feel
anything except through them. I was born in that instant to life, and it
seemed to me that I filled with my light existence all the objects which
I perceived. Entirely given up to the present moment, I did not remember
anything; I had no distinct[]{#calibre_link-4214} notion of my
individuality, not the least idea of what had happened to me; I did not
know who I was nor where I was; I felt neither evil nor fear, nor
trouble.

And, as around the water hole, and on the Isle of St. Pierre, the
enjoyment *\[jouissance\]* of pure presence is that of a certain flow.
Presence being born. Origin of life, blood's resemblance to water.
Rousseau continues:

I saw my blood[]{#calibre_link-4215} flowing as I might have looked at a
brooklet, without dreaming even that this blood in any way belonged to
me. I felt in the whole of my being a ravishing calm, to which, each
time that I think of it, I find nothing comparable in the whole action
of known pleasures (p. 1005) \[p. 49\].

[]{#calibre_link-1046}Are there other or more archetypal pleasures? This
pleasure, which is the only pleasure, is at the same time
properly[]{#calibre_link-4216} *unimaginable*. Such is the paradox of
the imagination: it alone arouses or irritates desire but also it alone,
and for the same reason, in the same movement, extends beyond or divides
presence. Rousseau would like to separate the awakening to presence from
the operation of imagination; he always presses on toward that
impossible limit. For the awakening of presence projects or rejects us
immediately[]{#calibre_link-4217} outside of presence where we are "led
... by that living interest, foresightful and all-providing *\[prévoyant
et pourvoyant\]*, which ... always throws us far from the present, and
which does not exist for natural man"
(*Dialogues).^[]{#calibre_link-803}[34](#calibre_link-463){.nounder}^*
Function of representation, imagination is also the temporalizing
function, the excess of the present and the economy of what exceeds
presence. There is no unique and full[]{#calibre_link-4218} present (but
is there presence then?) except in the imagination's sleep: "The
sleeping imagination does not know at all how to extend its being into
two different times" (*Emile*, p. 69). When it appears, signs, fiduciary
values \[legal tender and trusts\], and letters emerge, and they are
worse than death.

How many merchants lament in Paris over some misfortune in India! ...
There is a healthy, cheerful,[]{#calibre_link-4219} strong, and vigorous
man; it does me good to see him. ... A letter comes by post. ... \[He\]
falls into a swoon. When he comes to himself he weeps, laments, and
groans, he tears his hair, and his shrieks re-echo through the air. You
would say he was in convulsions. Fool, what harm has this bit of paper
done you? What limb has it torn away? ... We no longer live in our own
place, we live outside it.[]{#calibre_link-4220} What does it profit me
to live in such fear of death, when all that makes life worth living
remains? (*Emile*, pp. 67--68) \[p. 47\]

Rousseau himself articulates this chain of significations (essence,
origin, presence, birth, rebirth) on the classical metaphysics of the
entity as *energy*, encompassing the relationships between being and
time in terms of the now as being in action (*energeia):*

Delivered[]{#calibre_link-4221} from the disquietude of hope, and *sure
of thus gradually losing that of desire*, seeing that the past was no
longer anything to me, I undertook to put myself completely in the
situation of a man who begins to live. I told myself that in fact *we
were always beginning, and that there was no other link in our existence
but a succession of present moments of which the first is always that
which is[]{#calibre_link-4222} in action*. We are born and die every
moment of our life.

It follows---but it is a *liaison* that Rousseau works very hard to
elide---that the very essence of presence, if it must always be repeated
within another presence, opens originarily, within presence itself, the
structure of representation. And if essence *is* presence, there is no
essence of presence nor presence of essence. There is a play
of[]{#calibre_link-4223} representation and eliding that liaison
[]{#calibre_link-993}or that consequence, Rousseau places play out of
play: he eludes, which is another way of playing, or rather, as the
dictionaries say, of playing (with). What is thus eluded is the fact
that representation does not suddenly encroach upon presence; it
inhabits it as the very condition of its experience, of desire, and of
enjoyment *\[jouissance\]*. The intertior[]{#calibre_link-4224} doubling
of presence, its halving, makes it appear as such, that is to say,
concealing enjoyment in frustration, makes it disappear as such. Placing
representation outside, which means placing the outside outside,
Rousseau would like to make of the supplement of presence a pure and
simple addition, a contingence: thus wishing to elude what, in the
interior of presence, calls forth the substitute,[]{#calibre_link-4225}
and is constituted only in that appeal, and in its trace.

Thence the letter. Writing is the evil of representative repetition, the
double that opens desire and contemplates and binds *\[re-garde\]*
enjoyment. Literary writing, the traces of the *Confessions*, speak that
doubling of presence. Rousseau condemns the evil of writing and looks
for a haven within writing. It repeats enjoyment
symbolically.[]{#calibre_link-4226} And just as enjoyment has never been
present except in a certain repetition, so writing, recalling enjoyment,
gives it as well. Rousseau eludes its admission but not the pleasure. We
recall those texts ("Saying to myself I have rejoiced, I rejoice again.
..." "I rejoice again in a pleasure that no longer is." ... "Incessantly
occupied with the thought of my past happiness, I recall it, so to
speak,[]{#calibre_link-4227} chew the cud of it to such an extent that,
when I desire it, I am able to enjoy it over again") \[p. 607\]. Writing
*represents* (in every sense of the word) enjoyment. It plays enjoyment,
renders it present and absent. It is play. And it is because it is also
the good fortune of enjoyment repeated that Rousseau practices it while
condemning it: "I shall set down in writing those \['delightful
contemplations'\][]{#calibre_link-4228} which may still come to me: each
time that I reread them will give me new pleasure" (*Reveries*, p. 999)
\[p. 38\].

This entire digression was necessary in order to mark well that, unless
some extrinsic desire is invested in it, Leibniz's universal
characteristic represents the very death of enjoyment. It leads the
representer to the limit of its excess. Phonetic writing, however
abstract and arbitrary,[]{#calibre_link-4229} retained some relationship
with the presence of the represented voice, to its possible presence in
general and therefore to that of a certain passion. A writing that
breaks with the *phonè* radically is perhaps the most rational and
effective of scientific machines; it no longer responds to any desire or
rather *it signifies its death to desire*. It was what already operated
within speech as writing[]{#calibre_link-4230} and machine. It is the
representer in its pure state, without the represented, or without the
order of the represented naturally linked to it. That is why this pure
conventionality ceases, being pure, to be of any use within "civil
life," which always mingles nature and convention. The perfection of
convention here touches its opposite extreme, it is death and the
perfect alienation of the instrument[]{#calibre_link-4231} of civil
order. The telos of the []{#calibre_link-1024}alienation of writing has
in Rousseau's eyes the form of scientific or technical writing, wherever
it can act, that is to say even outside of the areas reserved for
"science" or "technology." It is not by chance that in mythology, the
Egyptian in particular, the god of sciences and technologies is also the
god of writing; and that it is he (Thoth, Theuth,
Teuthus[]{#calibre_link-4232} or his Greek homologue Hermes, god of the
ruse, of trade, and of thieves) whom Rousseau incriminates in the
*Discourse on the Arts and Sciences*. (Plato had already denounced his
invention of writing at the end of the *Phaedrus.):*

An ancient tradition passed out of Egypt into Greece, that some god, who
was an enemy to the repose of mankind, was the inventor of the
sciences.[]{#calibre_link-1208}[\*](#calibre_link-464){.nounder} ... In
fact, whether we[]{#calibre_link-4233} turn to the annals of the world,
or supplement with philosophical investigations the uncertain chronicles
of history, we shall not find for human knowledge an origin answering to
the idea we are pleased to entertain of it at present. ... Their evil
origin is indeed, but too plainly reproduced in their objects. \[Cole,
op. cit., p. 131.\]

#### ***The Supplement of (at) the Origin*** {#calibre_link-50 .h3}

In the last pages of the[]{#calibre_link-4234} chapter "On Script," the
critique, the appreciative presentation, and the history of writing,
*declares* the absolute exteriority of writing but *describes* the
interiority of the principle of writing to language. The sickness of the
outside (which comes from the outside but also draws outside, thus
equally, or inversely, the sickness of the homeland, a homesickness, so
to speak) is in the heart of[]{#calibre_link-4235} the living word, as
its principle of effacement and its relationship to its own death. In
other words, it does not suffice to show, it is in fact not a question
of showing, the interiority of what Rousseau would have believed
exterior; rather to speculate upon the power of exteriority as
constitutive of interiority: of speech, of signified meaning, of the
present as such; in the sense in which I[]{#calibre_link-4236} said, a
moment ago, that the representative mortal doubling-halving constituted
the living present, without adding itself to presence; or rather
constituted it, paradoxically, by being added to it. The question is of
an originary supplement, if this absurd expression may be risked,
totally unacceptable as it is within classical logic. Rather the
supplement of origin: which supplements the
failing[]{#calibre_link-4237} origin and which is yet not derived; this
supplement is, as one says of a spare part *\[une pièce\], of* the
original make *\[d' origine\]* \[or a document, establishing the
origin.\]

[]{#calibre_link-1096}Thus one takes into account that the absolute
*alterity* of writing might nevertheless affect living speech, from the
outside, within its inside: *alter it* \[for the worse\]. Even as it has
an independent history, as we have seen,[]{#calibre_link-4238} and in
spite of the inequalities of development, the play of structural
correlations, writing marks the history of speech. Although it is born
out of "needs of a different kind" and "according to circumstances
entirely independent of the duration of the people," although these
needs might "never have occurred," the irruption of this absolute
contingency determined the interior of an
essential[]{#calibre_link-4239} history and affected the interior unity
of a life, *literally infected* it. It is the strange essence of the
supplement not to have essentiality: it may always not have taken place.
Moreover, literally, it has never taken place: it is never present, here
and now. If it were, it would not be what it is, a supplement, taking
and keeping the place of the other. What alters for the worse the
living[]{#calibre_link-4240} nerve of language ("Writing, which would
seem to crystallize language, is precisely what alters it; it changes
not the words but the spirit of language ...") has therefore above all
not taken place. Less than nothing and yet, to judge by its effects,
much more than nothing. The supplement is neither a presence nor an
absence. No ontology can think its operation.

As Saussure will do, so does Rousseau[]{#calibre_link-4241} wish at once
to maintain the exteriority of the system of writing and the maleficent
efficiency with which one singles out its symptoms on the body of the
language. But am I saying anything else? Yes, in as much as I show the
interiority of exteriority, which amounts to annulling the ethical
qualification and to thinking of writing beyond good and evil; yes above
all, in as much as we designate[]{#calibre_link-4242} the impossibility
of formulating the movement of supplementarity within the classical
logos, within the logic of identity, within ontology, within the
opposition of presence and absence, positive and negative, and even
within dialectics, if at least one determines it, as spiritualistic or
materialistic metaphysics has always done, within the horizon of
presence and reappropriation. Of course the[]{#calibre_link-4243}
*designation* of that impossibility escapes the language of metaphysics
only by a hairsbreadth. For the rest, it must borrow its resources from
the logic it deconstructs. And by doing so, find its very foothold
there.

One can no longer see disease in substitution when one sees that the
substitute is substituted for a substitute. Is that not what the *Essay
describes?*" \[Writing substitutes\] exactitude[]{#calibre_link-4244}
for expressiveness." Expression is the expression of affect, of the
passion at the origin of language, of a speech that was first
substituted for song, marked by *tone* and *force*. Tone and force
signify the *present voice:* they are anterior to the concept, they are
singular, they are, moreover, attached to vowels, the vocalic and not
the consonantic element of language. The force of expression
amounts[]{#calibre_link-4245} only to vocalic sounds, when the subject
is there in person to utter his []{#calibre_link-4246}passion. When the
subject is no longer there, force, intonation, and accent are lost in
the concept. Then one writes, one "substitutes" in vain "accentual
marks" for "accent," one bows to the generality of the law: "In writing,
one is forced to use all the words according to their conventional
meaning. But in speaking, one[]{#calibre_link-4247} varies the meanings
by varying one's tone of voice, determining them as one pleases. Being
less constrained to clarity, one can be more forceful. And it is not
possible for a language that is written to retain its vitality as long
as one that is only spoken" *\[Essay*, pp. 21--22\].

Thus writing is always atonal. The place of the subject is there taken
by another, it is concealed. The spoken sentence,[]{#calibre_link-4248}
which is valuable only once and remains "proper only to the place where
it is," loses its place and its proper meaning as soon as it is written
down. "The means used to overcome *\[suppléer\]* this weakness tend to
stretch out written language and make it elaborately prolix; and many
books written in discourse will enervate speech itself."

But if Rousseau could say that "words *\[voix*\], not sounds
*[]{#calibre_link-4249}\[sons*\], are written," it is because words are
distinguished from sounds exactly by what permits writing---consonants
and articulation. The latter replace only themselves. Articulation,
which replaces accent, is the origin of languages. Altering \[for the
worse\] through writing is an originary exteriority. It is the origin of
language. Rousseau describes it without declaring it. Clandestinely.

A speech[]{#calibre_link-4250} without consonantic principle, what for
Rousseau would be a speech sheltered from all writing, would not be
speech;^[]{#calibre_link-804}[35](#calibre_link-465){.nounder}^ it would
hold itself at the fictive limit of the inarticulate and purely natural
cry. Conversely, a speech of pure consonants and pure articulation would
become pure writing, algebra, or dead language. The death of speech is
therefore the horizon and origin of language. But
an[]{#calibre_link-4251} origin and a horizon which do not hold
themselves at its exterior borders. As always, death, which is neither a
present to come nor a present past, shapes the interior of speech, as
its trace, its reserve, its interior and exterior differance: as its
supplement.

But Rousseau could not think this writing, that takes place *before* and
*within* speech. To the extent that he belonged to the
metaphysics[]{#calibre_link-4252} of presence, he *dreamed* of the
simple exteriority of death to life, evil to good, representation to
presence, signifier to signified, representer to represented, mask to
face, writing to speech. But all such oppositions are irreducibly rooted
in that metaphysics. Using them, one can only operate by reversals, that
is to say by confirmations. The supplement is none of these terms. It is
especially[]{#calibre_link-4253} not more a signifier than a signified,
a representer than a presence, a writing than a speech. None of the
terms of this series can, being comprehended within it, dominate the
economy of differance or supplementarity. Rousseau's *dream* consisted
of making the supplement enter metaphysics by force.

[]{#calibre_link-1076}But what does that mean? The opposition of dream
to wakefulness, is not that a representation of[]{#calibre_link-4254}
metaphysics as well? And what should dream or writing be if, as we know
now, one may dream while writing? And if the scene of dream is always a
scene of writing? At the bottom of a page of *Emile*, after having once
more cautioned us against books, writing, signs ("What is the use of
inscribing on their brains a list of symbols which mean nothing for
them?"), after having opposed the "tracing" of[]{#calibre_link-4255}
these artificial signs to the "indelible characters" of the Book of
Nature, Rousseau adds a note: "... the dreams of a bad night are given
to us as philosophy. You will say I too am a dreamer; I admit it, but I
do what others fail to do, I give my dreams as dreams, and leave the
reader to discover whether there is anything in them which may prove
useful to those who are awake" \[p. 76\].

[]{#calibre_link-68}[13](#calibre_link-479){.nounder}. Because it
overlooks the invisible erasure, the usual superficial criticism of
Derrida goes as follows: he says[]{#calibre_link-4267} he is questioning
the value of "truth" and "logic," yet he uses logic to demonstrate the
truth of his own arguments! (A characteristic example would be Lionel
Abel, "Jacques Derrida: His *'Difference'* with Metaphysics,"
*Salmagundi* 25 \[Winter, 1974\]: 3--21.) The point is, of course, that
the predicament of having to use resources of the heritage that one
questions is the *overt* concern of Derrida's[]{#calibre_link-4268}
work, and as such is prepared for, as I shall show, by the fundamental
questionings of Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger.

[]{#calibre_link-73}[18](#calibre_link-484){.nounder}. Here Derrida's
often implicit Freudianism surfaces. The history of metaphysics, like a
dream-neurosis-psychosis, is constituted by distortion. Metaphor and
metonymy are rhetorical translations of "condensation" and
"displacement," two major techniques, as Freud pointed out, of
dream-distortion[]{#calibre_link-4270} (see also page **xlvi**).

[]{#calibre_link-74}[19](#calibre_link-485){.nounder}. Marx is
conspicuous here by his absence. Derrida's detachment from Marxist texts
is often a ground for dissatisfaction among younger French and American
intellectuals---some of the Tel Quel group, Felix Guattari, Fredric
Jameson. I believe there is a simple enough explanation for this
detachment. Derrida's method of deconstructive reading is laboriously
textual. As a young[]{#calibre_link-4271} philosopher he has coped with
specifically "philosophical" texts. Catching the Freudian avant-garde of
the fifties and sixties, he has coped, and is coping, with the texts of
Freud. His interest now, for reasons I discuss on page lxxii, is going
toward "literary" texts. In general, the literature of Marxism is so
thoroughly schematized that for him to direct the same painstaking
attention to[]{#calibre_link-4272} the texts of Marx and Marxism will
require a good stretch of time. In answer to a question of Jean-Louis
Houdebine, Derrida presents a long and interesting answer which, for my
purposes, can be summed up as follows: Marx, and his intertextuality
with Hegel, Engels, Lenin, Mao, et alia, are still to be submitted to
the protocol of reading. See *Pos* F 82 f., *Pos* E II 33 f. The
distinctions between[]{#calibre_link-4273} super- and infrastructures
must be reexamined. The textuality of "economic" structures (in a narrow
sense) must be opened up to a more general concept of economy. ... A
remote prospectus may be glimpsed in MP, pp. 257--58n, "White

[]{#calibre_link-100}[45](#calibre_link-511){.nounder}. Of a good many
examples, I shall cite one: "The 'lacunae' to which you alluded, and do
me the justice of believing this, are explicitly calculated to mark the
loci of[]{#calibre_link-4289} a theoretical elaboration ..." (*Pos* F
85, *Pos* E II 33). An example of the defense of "my master's mastery"
is to be found even in Paul de Man's brilliant essay "The Rhetoric of
Blindness: Jacques Derrida's Reading of Rousseau" (*Blindness and
Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism* \[New York,
1971\]): "Rousseau was not deluded and said what he meant to say. ...
Instead of having Rousseau[]{#calibre_link-4290} deconstruct his
critics, we have Derrida deconstructing a pseudo-Rousseau by means of
insights that could have been gained from the 'real' Rousseau" (pp. 135,
139--40). Yet, as we read Derrida's own pages on Lévi-Strauss and
Rousseau ([part 2](#calibre_link-101){.nounder}, [chapter
1](#calibre_link-161){.nounder}, *Of Grammatology*), we sense the same
claim being made for Rousseau over Lévi-Strauss: both have given writing
short shrift, yet Rousseau's *text*[]{#calibre_link-4291}, if not
Rousseau, had *known* that simply to do so would have been merely
symptomatic. The value of mastery, of knowledge, of control, even of
having got there first, persists, however vestigially. The "subject" of
knowledge then becomes the text. "\[The critic's\] use may be no more
than to identify an act of deconstruction which has always already, in
each case differently, been performed by the[]{#calibre_link-4292} text
on itself" (J. Hillis Miller, "Deconstructing the Deconstructers,"
*Diacritics* V, ii \[Summer 1975\]: 31). This value-in-mastery too is
perhaps a "metaphysical" axiom that criticism, at the limit, cannot
avoid. For those who are "aware" that this battle cannot be won, there
is some measure of comfort in being able to recognize that a *text*,
even when assigned control, is never sovereign,
always[]{#calibre_link-4293} ridden by the absence of the subject,
always offering a "lack" that the reader must fill, as well as the
materials with which to begin to fill it.

typically this question of the *sous rature* that François Wahl must
treat[]{#calibre_link-4303} very lightly as a precaution almost
automatically taken for granted within all responsible structuralist
practice. The discussion is, in general, not unsympathetic to Derrida.
In the long run, however, it is not touched by Derrida, whose version of
structuralism is put "in its place" as a "contamination of the properly
structural gesture by the ontological, psychological, and transcendental
determinations[]{#calibre_link-4304} of phenomenology" (p. 419).
Derrida's reactions to formulations such as these would be a variation
on his response to Elisabeth Roudinesco.

[]{#calibre_link-126}[69](#calibre_link-535){.nounder}. Ibid., p. 218.
In *Révolution du langage poétique* (Paris, 1974), Julia Kristeva
attempts to neutralize signification and go beyond it into a study of
the flexible and contingent positioning[]{#calibre_link-4305} of subject
and object that we come to call "signification." In "Sémiotique et
symbolique," the opening section, she would appropriate into
structuralism "the functioning of writing, of the trace, and the grammè
that Jacques Derrida has introduced in his critique of phenomenology"
(p. 40). When she writes "my concern is therefore not the operating and
producing consciousness, but rather the producible[]{#calibre_link-4306}
consciousness" (p. 35 n.), we might think we hear an echo of Derrida's
"there is no constituting subjectivity" (*VP* 94, *SP* 85 n.). But
Derrida's next sentence is: "The very concept of constitution itself
must be deconstructed." And Kristeva, as is evident from the quotation
above, does not deconstruct or undo the concept of "production," but
rather works within it to say of consciousness---not
producing[]{#calibre_link-4307} but producible. Aware of the importance
of the ground of precomprehended questions, she proposes the thought of
the *chora* (a Platonic term), designating "a non-expressive totality
constituted by ... drives *\[pulsions\]* and their *stases* into a
motility as full of movement as it is regulated" (p. 23). The thought of
the *chora*, a play of the movement and rest of forces, "... a delaying
as well as one of[]{#calibre_link-4308} the possible realizations of the
death instinct" (p. 27 n.), "not a transcendental signifier but that
which opens signification" (p. 46), does indeed seem
[]{#calibre_link-839}close to Derrida's vocabulary. But in fact that
thought rests on a set of hierarchized oppositions, is defined always as
anterior rather than posterior, pre- rather than post-verbal, pre-
rather than postfigurative. It is an ambitious and
valuable[]{#calibre_link-4309} book, but it does not articulate or
perform the "sous rature." It is not surprising, then, that Kristeva
uses her long-standing dyad---the *génotexte* and the
*phénotexte*---when she reads individual poems, reverting to the
recognizable scientistic structuralist idiom, closing the book with a
confidently compartmentalized "Synoptic Table" arranged under
"Lautréamont," "Mallarmé," "Political Events and[]{#calibre_link-4310}
the Social Situation," "Scientific Events-Discoveries," and "French
Colonialist Expansion"---material for those general laws that differance
would not countenance.

[]{#calibre_link-138}[79](#calibre_link-545){.nounder}. Jeffrey Mehlman
relates this project---the desire that word be one with meaning---with
Narcissus's desire[]{#calibre_link-4313} to be one with his image, and
with the child's narcissistic desire to be one with the mother in his
*Structural Study of Autobiography: Proust, Leiris, Sartre,
Lévi-Strauss* (Ithaca, London, 1974). I am indebted to Michael Ryan for
an illuminating discussion of the relationship between such a narcissism
and Derrida's project of "unbalancing" the equation. In "La
dissémination" (*Dis* pp. 322--407),[]{#calibre_link-4314} Derrida
presents the structure of the square with an open (yet presupposed)
fourth side---Ryan relates this to the forever active triangularity of
the oedipal position, which intervenes to resolve the unfulfilled
narcissistic desire for self-enclosure (review forthcoming, in
*Diacritics*, of Mehlman's book.) For a somewhat restricted yet
interesting discussion of Derrida's tetrapolarity (logic
of[]{#calibre_link-4315} the open square, rather than the Hegelian
triplicity or circularity, and rather than the longed-for narcissistic
self-enclosed dyad) see Robert Greer Cohn, "Nodes," I, *Diacritics* 4, i

### ***Preface*** {#preface .h2}

[]{#calibre_link-155}[1](#calibre_link-552){.nounder}. It may be read as
an essay published in the review *Critique* (December 1965-January
1966). Three important publications provided me the opportunity:
Madeleine V.-David, *Le débat sur les écritures et l'hieroglyphe aux
xvii° et xviii° siècles* (1965) (DE); André Leroi-Gourhan, *Le geste et
la parole* (1965) (GP); *L'écriture et la psychologie des
peuples*[]{#calibre_link-4321} (Proceedings of a Colloquium, 1963) (EP).

### ***Exergue*** {#exergue .h2}

[]{#calibre_link-157}[1](#calibre_link-553){.nounder}. Cf. for example,
the notions of "secondary elaboration" or "symbolism of second
intention" in Edmond Ortigues, Le *discours et le symbole* (Aubier,
1962) pp. 62 and 171. "Mathematical symbolism is a convention of
writing, a scriptural symbolism. It is only by an abuse of vocabulary or
by analogy that one speaks of a 'mathematical language.'
Algorithm[]{#calibre_link-4322} is actually a 'characteristics,' it is
composed of written characters. It does not speak, except through the
intermediary of a language which furnishes not only the phonetic
expression of the characters, but also the formulation of axioms
permitting the determination of the value of these characters. It is
true that at a pinch one could decipher unknown characters, but that
always supposes[]{#calibre_link-4323} an acquired knowledge, a thought
already formed by the usage of speech. Therefore, in all hypothesis,
mathematical symbolism is the fruit of a secondary elaboration,
supposing preliminarily the usage of discourse and the possibility of
conceiving explicit conventions. It is nevertheless true that
mathematical algorithm will express the formal laws of symbolization, of
syntactic structures, independent[]{#calibre_link-4324} of particular
means of expression." On these problems, cf. also Gilles Gaston Granger,
*Pensée formelle et sciences de l'homme* (Paris, 1960), pp. 38 f. and
particularly pp. 43 and 50 f. (on the "Reversal of Relationships between
the Spoken Language and Writing").

[]{#calibre_link-158}[2](#calibre_link-554){.nounder}. All works on the
history of writing devote space to the problem of the introduction of
phonetic writing in the cultures that did[]{#calibre_link-4325} not
practice it previously. Cf. e.g., EP, pp. 44 f. or "La reforme de
l'écriture chinoise," *Linguistique, Recherches internationales* à *la
lumi*è*re du marxisme* 7 (May--June 1958).

[]{#calibre_link-159}[3](#calibre_link-555){.nounder}. Here I do not
merely mean those "theological prejudices" which, at an identifiable
time and place, inflected or repressed the theory of the written sign in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. I shall speak
of[]{#calibre_link-4326} them later in connection with Madeleine
V.-David's book. These prejudices are nothing but the most clearsighted
and best circumscribed, historically determined manifestation of a
constitutive and permanent presupposition essential to the history of
the West, therefore to metaphysics in its entirety, even when it
professes to be atheist.

[]{#calibre_link-160}[4](#calibre_link-556){.nounder}. *Grammatology:*
"A treatise upon Letters, upon the alphabet,[]{#calibre_link-4327}
syllabation, reading, and writing," Littré. To my knowledge and in our
time, this word has only been used by I. J. Gelb to designate the
project of a modern science in A *Study of Writing: The Foundations of
Grammatology* \[Chicago\], 1952 (the subtitle disappears in the 1963
edition). In spite of a concern for systematic or simplified
classification, and in spite of the controversial hypotheses
on[]{#calibre_link-4328} the monogenesis or polygenesis of scripts, this
book follows the classical model of histories of writing.

#### *Part I: Chapter 1* {#part-i-chapter-1 .h3}

[]{#calibre_link-163}[1](#calibre_link-557){.nounder}. To speak of a
primary writing here does not amount to affirming a chronological
priority of fact. That debate is well-known; is writing, as affirmed,
for example, by []{#calibre_link-135}Metchaninov and Marr, then
Loukotka, "anterior to phonetic language?" (A conclusion assumed by the
first[]{#calibre_link-4329} edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia,
later contradicted by Stalin. On this debate, cf. V. Istrine, "Langue et
écriture," *Linguistique*, op. cit., pp. 35, 60. This debate also forms
around the theses advanced by P. van Ginneken. On the discussion of
these propositions, cf. James Février, *Histoire de l'écriture* \[Payot,
1948--59\], pp. 5 f.). I shall try to show below why the terms and
premises[]{#calibre_link-4330} of such a debate are suspicious.

[]{#calibre_link-164}[2](#calibre_link-558){.nounder}. I shall deal with
this problem more directly in *La voix et le phénomène* (Paris, 1967)
*\[Speech and Phenomena*, op. cit.\].

[]{#calibre_link-165}[3](#calibre_link-559){.nounder}. Wiener, for
example, while abandoning "semantics," and the opposition, judged by him
as too crude and too general, between animate and inanimate etc.,
nevertheless continues to use expressions like "organs of sense," "motor
organs," etc.[]{#calibre_link-4331} to qualify the parts of the machine.

[]{#calibre_link-166}[4](#calibre_link-560){.nounder}. Cf., e.g., *EP*,
pp. 126, 148, 355, etc. From another point of view, cf. Roman Jakobson,
*Essais de linguistique g*é*nérale* (tr. fr. \[Nicolas Ruwet, Paris,
1963\], p. 116) \[Jakobson and Morris Halle, *Fundamentals of Language*
(the Hague, 1956), p. 16\].

[]{#calibre_link-167}[5](#calibre_link-561){.nounder}. This is shown by
Pierre Aubenque (*Le problème de l'être chez Aristotle* \[Paris, 1966\],
pp. 106 f.). In the[]{#calibre_link-4332} course of a provocative
analysis, to which I am here indebted, Aubenque remarks: "In other
texts, to be sure, Aristotle designates as symbol the relationship
between language and things: 'It is not possible to bring the things
themselves to the discussion, but, instead of things, we can use their
names as symbols.' The intermediary constituted by the mental experience
is here suppressed or at least[]{#calibre_link-4333} neglected, but this
suppression is legitimate, since, mental experiences behaving like
things, things can be substitued for them immediately. On the other
hand, one cannot by any means substitute names for things" (pp.

by[]{#calibre_link-4335} simple inversion, mean that the signifier is
fundamental or primary. The "primacy" or "priority" of the signifier
would be an expression untenable and absurd to formulate illogically
within the very logic that it would legitimately destroy. The signifier
will never by rights precede the signified, in which case it would no
longer be a signifier and the "signifying" signifier would no longer
have a[]{#calibre_link-4336} possible signified. The thought that is
announced in this impossible formula without being successfully
contained therein should therefore be stated in another way; it will
clearly be impossible to do so without putting the very idea of the sign
into suspicion, the "sign-of" which will always remain attached to what
is here put in question. At the limit therefore, that thought would
destroy the entire[]{#calibre_link-4337} conceptuality organized around
the concept of the sign (signifier and signified, expression and
content, and so on).

we encountered when we characterized the Greek experience and
interpretation of being. If we retain the usual interpretation of being,
the word 'being' takes its meaning from the unity and determinateness of
the horizon which guided our understanding. In short: we understand the
verbal substantive []{#calibre_link-918}'Sein' through the infinitive,
which in turn is related[]{#calibre_link-4340} to the 'is' and its
diversity that we have described. The definite and particular verb form
'is,' the *third person singular of the present indicative*, has here a
pre-eminent rank. We understand 'being' not in regard to the 'thou art,'
'you are,' 'I am,' or 'they would be,' though all of these, just as much
as 'is,' represent verbal inflections of 'to be.' ... And involuntarily,
almost as though[]{#calibre_link-4341} nothing else were possible, we
explain the infinitive 'to be' to ourselves through the 'is.'

"Accordingly, 'being' has the meaning indicated above, recalling the
Greek view of the essence of being, hence a determinateness which has
not just dropped on us accidentally from somewhere but has dominated our
historical being-there since antiquity. At one stroke our search for the
definition of the[]{#calibre_link-4342} meaning of the word 'being'
becomes explicitly what it is, namely a reflection on the source of our
hidden history." I should, of course, cite the entire analysis that
concludes with these words.

revealed by recent studies, has no need of the word" (p. 40) \[p. 39\].
... "Grammarians and linguists have long known that the analysis of
utterances can be pursued beyond the word without going into phonetics,
that is, ending with segments of speech, such as syllables or phonemes,
which have nothing[]{#calibre_link-4345} to do with meaning" (p. 41)
\[p. 40\]. "We are touching here on what renders the notion of the word
so suspect to all true linguists. They cannot accept traditional writing
without verifying first whether it reproduces faithfully the true
structure of the language which it is supposed to record" (p. 48) \[p.
48\]. In conclusion Martinet proposes the replacement "in linguistic
practice" of the notion[]{#calibre_link-4346} of word by that of
"syntagm," any "group of several minimal signs" that will be called
"monemes."

[]{#calibre_link-195}[2](#calibre_link-573){.nounder}. Let us extend our
quotation to bring out the tone and the affect of these theoretical
propositions. Saussure *puts the blame on* writing: "Another result is
that the less writing represents what it is supposed to represent, the
stronger the tendency to use it as a basis becomes. Grammarians
never[]{#calibre_link-4347} fail to draw attention to the written form.
Psychologically, the tendency is easily explained, but its consequences
are annoying. Free use of the words 'pronounce' and 'pronunciation'
sanctions the abuse and reverses the real, legitimate relationship
between writing and language. Whoever says that a certain letter must be
pronounced a certain way is mistaking the written image of a sound for
the[]{#calibre_link-4348} sound itself. For French *oi* to be pronounced
*wa*, this spelling would have to exist independently; actually *wa* is
written *oi."* Instead of meditating upon this strange proposition, the
*possibility* of such a text ("actually *wa* is written *oi."*),
Saussure argues: "To attribute the oddity to an exceptional
pronunciation of o and *i* is also misleading, for this implies that
language depends on its written[]{#calibre_link-4349} form and that
certain liberties may be taken in writing, as if the graphic symbols
were the norm" (p. 52) \[p. 30\].

if, unlike Saussure, Rousseau here forbids himself to speak *in general*

identical state of affairs is observable in writing, another system of

"1) The signs used in writing are arbitrary; there is no connection, for

it designates.

"2) The value of letters is purely negative and differential. The same
person can []{#calibre_link-959}write *t*, for instances, in different
ways: *t* & t. The only requirement is that the sign for *t* not be
confused in his script with the signs used for *l, d*, etc.

"3) Values in writing function only through reciprocal opposition within
a fixed system that consists of a set number[]{#calibre_link-4362} of
letters. This third characteristic, though not identical to the second,
is closely related to it, for both depend on the first. Since the
graphic sign is arbitrary, its form matters little or rather matters
only within the limitations imposed by the system.

"4) The means by which the sign is produced is completely unimportant,
for it does not affect the system (this also follows from
characteristic[]{#calibre_link-4363} 1). Whether I make the letters in
white or black, raised or engraved, with pen or chisel---all this is of
no importance with respect to their signification" (pp. 165--66) \[pp.

fidelity is expressed:

1\. In the critical exposition of Hjelmslev's attempt ("Au sujet des
fondements de la théorie[]{#calibre_link-4364} linguistique de L.
Hjelmslev," *Bulletin de la Société Linguistique de Paris*, vol. 42, p.
40): "Hjelmslev is perfectly consistent with himself when he declares
that a written text has for the linguist exactly the same value as a
spoken text, since the choice of the substance is not important. He
refuses even to admit that the spoken substance is primitive and the
written substance derived. It seems[]{#calibre_link-4365} as if it would
suffice to make him notice that, but for certain pathological
exceptions, all human beings speak, but few know how to write, or that
children know how to speak long before they learn how to write. *I shall
therefore not press the point"* (italics added).

2\. In the *El*é*ments de linguistique g*é*nérale* \[(Paris, 1961);

character of language pick up the words and arguments of Chapter VI of
the *Course:* "\[One learns to speak before learning to read:\] reading
comes as a reflection of spoken usage: *the reverse is never true"*
(italics added. This proposition seems to me to be thoroughly debatable,
even on the level of that common experience which has the force of law
within this[]{#calibre_link-4367} argument.) Martinet concludes: "The
study of writing is a discipline distinct from linguistics proper,
although practically speaking it is one of its dependencies. Thus the
linguist in principle operates without regard for written forms" (p. 11)
\[p. 17\]. We see how the concepts of *dependency* and *abstraction*
function: writing and its science are alien but not independent; which
does not stop them[]{#calibre_link-4368} from being, conversely,
immanent but not essential. Just enough "outside" not to affect the
integrity of the language *itself*, in its pure original self-identity,
in its property; just enough "inside" not to have the right to any
practical or epistemological independence. And vice versa.

3\. In "The Word" (already cited): "... it is from speech that one
should always start in order to understand[]{#calibre_link-4369} the

"venturing to call" his directing principle an "empirical principle" (p.
12, English translation, p. 11). "But," he adds, "we are willing to
abandon the name if espistemological investigation shows it to be
inappropriate. From our point of view this is merely a question of
terminology, which does not affect the maintenance[]{#calibre_link-4376}
of the principle." This is only one example of the terminological
conventionalism of a system, which, in borrowing all its concepts from
the history of the metaphysics that it would hold at a distance
(form/substance, context/expression, etc.), believes it can neutralize
its entire historical burden by means of some declaration of intention,
a preface or quotation marks.

[]{#calibre_link-223}[28](#calibre_link-602){.nounder}. As for this
critique[]{#calibre_link-4377} of the concept of origin in general
(empirical and/or transcendental) we have elsewhere attempted to
indicate the schema of an argument (Introduction to Husserl's *L'origine

[]{#calibre_link-224}[29](#calibre_link-603){.nounder}. Op. cit., p.
111. Hjelmslev formulates the same reservations: "It is curious that
linguistics, so long on guard against any suspicion of 'psychologism,'
seems here, even if only to a certain extent[]{#calibre_link-4378} and
in very cautious proportions, to be on its way back to Saussure's
'acoustic image,' and equally to 'concept,' as long as that word is
interpreted in strict conformity with the doctrine that I have just
elaborated, in short to recognize, with however many necessary
reservations, that, with the two aspects of the linguistic sign, one is
in the presence of the 'purely psychological
phenomenon'[]{#calibre_link-4379} (*Course*, p. 28) \[p. 11\]. But it is
rather a partial coincidence of nomenclatures than a real analogy. The
terms introduced by Saussure, and the interpretations given in the
*Course*, have been abandoned because they can be equivocal, and it is
better not to make the same mistakes again. I too hesitate when I ask
myself how much the researches advocated here may be considered as
belonging to the[]{#calibre_link-4380} psychological order: the reason
being that psychology seems to be a discipline whose definition still
leaves much to be desired" ("La stratification du langage" *Essais
linguistiques* \[1954\], p. 56). Hjelmslev, posing the same problem,
already evoked those "numerous nuances that the Genevan master could be
fully aware of, but which he did not find it useful to insist upon; the
motives behind this[]{#calibre_link-4381} attitude naturally escapes us"
(p. 76).

[]{#calibre_link-228}[30](#calibre_link-604){.nounder}. I have attempted
a reading of Freud from this point of view ("Freud et la scène de
l'écriture," *L'écriture et la diff*é*rence*). It sets forth the
relationship between the concept of the trace and the structure of
"a-retardation" which I mention above.

[]{#calibre_link-229}[31](#calibre_link-605){.nounder}. This theme
inhabits more than one mythological system. Among many other examples,
Thoth, the Egyptian[]{#calibre_link-4382} god of writing evoked in
*Phaedrus*, inventor of the technical ruse, the analogue of Hermes, also
performed essential functions in funeral rites. When the opportunity
offered, he was the conductor of the dead. He inscribed the accounts
before the Last Judgment. He also occupied the function of the
secretary/substitute who usurped first place; of the king, the father,
the sun, of their eye. For example:[]{#calibre_link-4383} "As a general
rule, Horus' eye became the lunar eye. The moon, like everything that
touched the astral world, intrigued the Egyptians greatly. According to
one legend, the moon was created by the Sun-god to replace itself at
night: it was Thoth whom Rê designated for the exercise of this high
function of substitution. Another myth tried to explain the vicissitudes
of the moon by a periodic[]{#calibre_link-4384} battle whose
protagonists were Horus and Seth. During the combat, Horus' eye was
wrenched out, but Seth, finally []{#calibre_link-920}vanquished, was
obliged to return to his victorious opponent the eye that he had lifted;
according to another version, the eye returned on its own, or was
brought back by Thoth. Whatever the case might have been, Horus received
his eye back joyfully, and put it back in its place
after[]{#calibre_link-4385} purifying it. The Egyptians called that eye
*oudjat*, 'the healthy one.' We shall see that the *oudjat* eye played a
considerable role in the funerary religion, in the Osirian legend, and
in the sacrificial ceremony. This legend ... later received a solar
counterpart: it was said that the universal master, at the origin of the
world, was seen, for some unknown reason, to be without an eye. He
charged[]{#calibre_link-4386} Shou and Tefnout to bring it back. The
absence of the two messengers lasted so long that Rê was obliged to
replace the unfaithful eye. The eye, when it was brought back by Shou
and Tefnout, became very angry (a), seeing that its place had been
taken. In appeasement, Rê transformed it into the serpent-uraeus and
placed it on his forehead as the symbol of his power; furthermore, he
charged it to defend[]{#calibre_link-4387} him against his enemies. (a)
The eye shed tears (*rémyt*) from which men were born (*rémet);* the
mythic origin of men clearly rests upon a simple wordplay" (Jacques

the musical model and concludes: "This reading is developed according to
another *tempo* (and in another time); at the very limit, one leaves the
time of 'consecutivity' proper to habitual language." One could of
course[]{#calibre_link-4390} say "proper to the habitual concept" of
time and of language.

[]{#calibre_link-238}[38](#calibre_link-613){.nounder}. I have chosen to
demonstrate the necessity of this "deconstruction" by privileging the
Saussurian references, not only because Saussure still dominates
contemporary linguistics and semiology; it is also because he seems to
me to hold himself at the limit: at the same time within the metaphysics
that must be deconstructed and beyond[]{#calibre_link-4391} the concept
of the sign (signifier/signified) which he still uses. But Saussure's
scruples, his interminable hesitations, particularly in the matter of
the difference between the two "aspects" of the sign and in the matter
of "arbitrariness," are better realized through reading Robert Godel's
*Les sources manuscrites du cours de linguistique g*é*nérale*
(\[Geneva\], 1957) pp. 190 f. Suffice it to say[]{#calibre_link-4392}
here that it is not impossible that the literality of the *Course*, to
which we have indeed had to refer, should one day appear very suspect in
the light of unpublished material now being prepared for publication. I
am thinking particularly of the *Anagrams* \[now published, see note
4\]. Up to what point is Saussure responsible for the *Course* as it was
edited and published after his death? It is not[]{#calibre_link-4393} a
new question. Need we specify that, *here at least*, we cannot consider
it to be pertinent? Unless my project has been fundamentally
misunderstood, it should be clear by now that, caring very little about
Ferdinand de Saussure's *very* thought *itself*, I have interested
myself in a *text* whose literality has played a well-known role since
1915, operating within a system of readings, influences,
misunderstandings,[]{#calibre_link-4394} borrowings, refutations, etc.
What I could read---and equally what I could not read---under the title
of A *Course in General Linguistics* seemed important to the point of
excluding all hidden and "true" intentions of Ferdinand de Saussure. If
one were to discover that this text hid another text---and there will
never by anything but texts---and hid it in a determined sense, the
reading that I have just[]{#calibre_link-4395} proposed would not be
invalidated, at least for that particular reason. Quite the contrary.
Besides, at the very end of their first "Preface," the editors of the
*Course* themselves foresee this situation.

[]{#calibre_link-240}[1](#calibre_link-614){.nounder}. On the empirical
difficulties of a research into empirical origins, cf. M. Cohen, *La
grande invention de l'écriture* (\[Paris\], 1958), Book I, pp. 3 f. With
*L'histoire de l'écriture*[]{#calibre_link-4396}, by J. G. Février
(1948--59), it is in France the most important work on the general
history of writing. Madeleine V.-David has studied them in *Critique*
\[157\] (June 1960).

[]{#calibre_link-241}[2](#calibre_link-615){.nounder}. Madeleine
V.-David proposes a particular explanation for it. "It is certain that,
in nineteenth-century thought, a gap is produced following the too
exclusive apology for the facts of language (begun by Herder).
Paradoxically,[]{#calibre_link-4397} the century of the great
decipherings made a tabula rasa of the long preparation for those
decipherings, by parading the century's disaffection from the problem of
signs. ... Thus a gap remains to be filled, a continuity to be
reestablished. ... One can do no better than to indicate ... the
Leibnizian texts which deal, often conjointly, with the facts of Chinese
and the projects for a universal writing,[]{#calibre_link-4398} and the
multiple positions possible for writing and for the spoken. ... But
perhaps we do not suffer only from the blindness of the nineteenth
century with regard to signs. Undoubtedly the fact that we are
'alphabetic' writers also conspires strongly in hiding from us such
essential aspects of the activity of writing" (Discussion, EP, pp.
352--53).

[]{#calibre_link-249}[9](#calibre_link-622){.nounder}. I would like to
restore the context of this quotation: "I believe, however, that it
would[]{#calibre_link-4402} be possible to devise a further system to
enable one to make up the primitive words and their symbols in such a
language so that it could be learnt very quickly. Order is what it
needed: all the thoughts which can come into the human mind must be
arranged in an order like the natural order of the numbers. In a single
day one can learn to name every one of the infinite series of numbers,
and thus[]{#calibre_link-4403} to write infinitely many different words
in an unknown language. The same could be done for all the other words
necessary to express all the other things which fall within the purview
of the human mind. If this secret were discovered I am sure that the
language would soon spread throughout the world. Many people would
willingly spend five or six days in learning how to make themselves
understood by[]{#calibre_link-4404} the whole human race.

"But I do not think that your author has thought of this. There is
nothing in all his propositions to suggest it, and in any case the
discovery of such a language depends upon the true philosophy. For
without that philosophy it is impossible to number and order all the
thoughts of men or even to separate them out into clear and simple
thoughts, which in my opinion is the[]{#calibre_link-4405} great secret
for acquiring true scientific knowledge. If someone were to explain
correctly what are the simple ideas in the human imagination out of
which all human thoughts are compounded, and if his explanation were
generally received, I would dare to hope for a universal language very
easy to learn, to speak, and to write. The greatest advantage of such a
language would be the assistance it would[]{#calibre_link-4406} give to
men's []{#calibre_link-838}judgment, representing matters so clearly
that it would be almost impossible to go wrong. As it is, almost all our
words have confused meanings, and men's minds are so accustomed to them
that there is hardly anything which they can perfectly understand.

and of the possibilities of our demonstrating from internal evidence the
link between the characteristic and Leibniz's infinitist theology. For
that it would be necessary to go through and exhaust the entire content
of the project. I refer on this point to works already cited. Like
Leibniz when he wishes to recall in a letter the link between the
existence[]{#calibre_link-4409} of God and the possibility of a
universal script, I shall say here that "it is a proposition that \[we\]
cannot demonstrate properly without explaining the foundations of the
characteristic at length. ... But at present, suffice it to remark that
the foundation of my characteristic is also the demonstration of the
existence of God, for simple thoughts are the elements of the
characteristic, and[]{#calibre_link-4410} simple forms are the source of
things. Now I maintain that all simple forms are compatible among
themselves. It is a proposition that I cannot demonstrate properly
without explaining the foundations of the characteristic at length. But
if it is granted, then it follows that the nature of God which holds
absolutely all simple forms, is possible. Now we have proved above, that
God is, provided He is[]{#calibre_link-4411} possible. Therefore He
exists. Which had to be demonstrated." (Letter to the Princess
Elizabeth, 1678) There is an essential connection between the
possibility of the *ontological argument* and that of the
Characteristic.

\[p. 110\]. Madeleine V.-David criticizes this instrumentalism in the
works already cited. Instrumentalism, whose metaphysical dependence one
could not exaggerate, also often inspires the linguistic definition of
the essence of language,[]{#calibre_link-4422} assimilated into a
function, and, what is more significant, into a function exterior to its
content or its agent. This is always implied by the concept of the
utensil. Thus André Martinet accepts responsibility for and develops at
length the definition of language as "instrument," "tool," etc., whereas
the "metaphoric" nature of this definition, recognized by the author,
ought to have made it[]{#calibre_link-4423} problematic and to have
renewed the question of instrumentality, of the meaning of functioning,
and of the functioning of meaning. (Cf. *El*é*m*é*nts de linguistique

In particular, the author shows there that "the emergence of writing no
more develops out of a graphic nothingness[]{#calibre_link-4425} than
does the emergence of agriculture without the intervention of anterior
states" (p. 278); and that "ideography is anterior to pictography" (p.
280).

[]{#calibre_link-275}[33](#calibre_link-647){.nounder}. Certain remarks
of Leroi-Gourhan on "the loss of multi-dimensional symbolic thought" and
on the thought that "separates itself from linearized language" can
perhaps be interpreted thus.

[]{#calibre_link-276}[34](#calibre_link-648){.nounder}. Cf. EP, pp.
138--39; *GP* I, pp. 238--50. "The development[]{#calibre_link-4426} of
the first cities not only corresponds to the appearance of the
technician of fire but ... writing is born at the same time as
metallurgy. Here too, it is not a coincidence ..." (I, p. 252). "It is
at the moment when agrarian capitalism begins to establish itself that
the means of stabilizing it in written balance accounts appears and it
is also at the moment when social hierarchization is
affirmed[]{#calibre_link-4427} that writing constructs its first
genealogists" (p. 253). "The appearance of writing is not fortuitous;
after millennia of maturation in the systems of mythographic
representation the linear notation of thought emerges at the same time
as metal and slavery (see chapter VI). Its content is not fortuitous"
(II, p. 67; cf. also pp. 161--62).

Although it is now much better known and described,
this[]{#calibre_link-4428} structural solidarity, particularly between
capitalization and writing, has long been known: among many others, by
Rousseau, Court de Gebelin, Engels, etc.

[]{#calibre_link-277}[35](#calibre_link-649){.nounder}. Linear writing
has therefore indeed "constituted, during many millennia, independently
of its role as conserver of the collective memory, by its unfolding in
one dimension alone, the instrument of analysis out of which grew
philosophic[]{#calibre_link-4429} and scientific thought. The
conservation of thought can now be conceived otherwise than in terms of
books which will only for a short time keep the advantage of their rapid
manageability. A vast 'tape-library' with an electronic selection system
will in the near future show preselected and instantaneously retrieved
information. Reading will still retain its importance
[]{#calibre_link-861}for some centuries to come,[]{#calibre_link-4430}
in spite of its perceptible regression for most men, but writing
\[understood in the sense of linear inscription\] seems likely to
disappear rapidly, replaced by automatic dictaphones. Should one see in
this a sort of restoration of the state anterior to the phonetic
confiscation of the hand? I should rather think that it is here a
question of an aspect of the general phenomenon of manual
regression[]{#calibre_link-4431} (see p. 60) and of a new 'liberation.'
As to the long-term consequences in terms of the forms of reasoning, and
a return to diffuse and multidimensional thought, they cannot be now
foreseen. Scientific thought is rather hampered by the necessity of
drawing itself out in typographical channels and it is certain that if
some procedure would permit the presentation of books in such a way that
the[]{#calibre_link-4432} materials of the different chapters are
presented simultaneously in all their aspects, authors and their users
would find a considerable advantage. It is absolutely certain that if
scientific reasoning has clearly nothing to lose with the disappearance
of writing, philosophy and literature will definitely see their forms
evolve. This is not particularly regrettable since printing will
conserve the[]{#calibre_link-4433} curiously archaic forms of thought
that men will have used during the period of alphabetic graphism; as to
the new forms, they will be to the old ones as steel to flint, not only
a sharper but a more flexible instrument. Writing will pass into the
infrastructure without altering the functioning of intelligence, as a
transition which will have some centuries of primacy" (*GP*, II, pp.
261--62. See[]{#calibre_link-4434} also *EP*, *Conclusion*).

[]{#calibre_link-278}[36](#calibre_link-650){.nounder}. The "XXIIe
Semaine de synthèse," a colloquium whose contents were collected in
*L'écriture et la psychologie des peuples*, was placed under the rubric
of this remark of Marcel Cohen's ("La grande invention de l'écriture et
son evolution"). But at each moment the rich suggestions made during the
colloquium point beyond the graphological project. Mr. Cohen himself
recognizes[]{#calibre_link-4435} the difficulty and the premature
character of such a task: "We can obviously not begin to deal with the
graphology of peoples; it would be too delicate, too difficult. But we
can express the idea that it is not only because of technical reasons
that there are differences, there may be something else" (p. 342).

[]{#calibre_link-279}[37](#calibre_link-651){.nounder}. Text of 1923,
collected in the *Essais de psychanalyse*, tr. fr., pp. 95 f. I
shall[]{#calibre_link-4436} quote a few lines: "For Fritz, when he was
*writing*, the lines meant roads and the letters ride on
motor-bicycles---on the pen---upon them. For instance, 'i' and 'e' ride
together on a motor-bicycle that is usually driven by the 'i' and they
love one another with a tenderness quite unknown in the real world.
Because they always ride with one another they become so alike that
there is hardly any difference[]{#calibre_link-4437} between them, for
the beginning and the end---he was talking of the small Latin
alphabet---of 'i' and 'e' are the same, only in the middle the 'i' has a
little stroke and the 'e' has a little hole. Concerning the Gothic
letters 'i' and 'e,' he explained that they also ride on a
motor-bicycle, and that it is only a difference like another make of
bicycle that the 'e' has a little box instead of[]{#calibre_link-4438}
the hole in the Latin 'e.' The 'i's are skillful, distinguished and
clever, have many pointed weapons, and live in caves, between which,
however, there are also mountains, gardens and harbours. They represent
the penis, and their path coitus. On the other hand, the 'l's are
represented as stupid, clumsy, lazy and dirty. They live in caves under
the earth. In 'L'-town dirt and paper gather in
the[]{#calibre_link-4439} streets, in the little 'filthy' houses they
mix with water a dyestuff bought in 'I'-land and drink and sell this as
wine. They cannot walk properly and cannot dig because they hold the
spade upside down, etc. It became evident that the l's represented
faeces. Numerous phantasies were concerned with other letters also.
Thus, instead of the double's,' he always wrote only one, until a
phantasy afforded[]{#calibre_link-4440} the explanation and solution of
this inhibition. The one 's' was himself, the other his father. They
were to embark together on a motor-boat, for the pen was also a boat,
the copy-book a lake. The's' that was himself got into the boat that
belonged to the other's' and sailed away in it quickly upon the lake.
This was the reason why he did not write the two 's's' together. His
frequent use of ordinary[]{#calibre_link-4441} 's' in place of a long
one proved to be determined by the fact that the part of the long's'
that was thus left out was for him as though one were to take away a
person's nose.' This mistake proved to be determined by the
castration-father and disappeared after this interpretation." I cannot
cite here all the analogous examples that Melanie Klein analyzes. Let us
read the following passage,[]{#calibre_link-4442} of a more general
value: "With Ernst as well as with Fritz I could observe that the
inhibition in respect of writing and reading, that is,
[]{#calibre_link-812}the basis for all further school activity,
proceeded from the letter 'i,' which, with its simple 'up and down,' is
indeed the foundation of all writing (Note \[Klein's footnote\]: At a
meeting of the Berlin P. A. Society, Herr Rohr dealt in some detail with
the[]{#calibre_link-4443} Chinese script and its interpretation on a
psychoanalytic basis. In the subsequent discussion I pointed out that
the earlier picture-script, which underlies our script too, is still
active in the phantasies of every individual child, so that the various
strokes dots, etc., of our present script would only be simplifications,
achieved as a result of condensation, displacement and other
mechanisms[]{#calibre_link-4444} familiar to us from dreams and
neuroses, of the earlier pictures whose traces, however, would be
demonstrable in the individual.) The sexual-symbolic meaning of a
penholder is apparent in these examples. ... It can be observed how the
sexual-symbolic meaning of the penholder merges into the act of writing
that the latter discharges. In the same way the libidinal significance
of reading is derived[]{#calibre_link-4445} from the symbolic cathexis
of the book and the eye. In this there are at work, of course, also
other determinants afforded by the component-instincts, such as
'peeping' in reading, and exhibitionistic, aggressive sadistic
tendencies in writing; at the root of the sexual-symbolic meaning of the
penholder lay probably originally that of the weapon and the hand.
Corresponding with this too the activity[]{#calibre_link-4446} of
reading is a more passive, that of writing a more active, one, and for
the inhibitions of one or the other of them the various fixations on the
pregenital stages of organization are also significant" (tr. fr.

*"Les primitifs, signaux et symboles, pictogrammes et
protoécriture."*[]{#calibre_link-4448} One example among many others of
what Métraux calls "attempt at phoneticism": "Thus, the Cheyenne chief
called 'tortoise-following-his-female' will be represented by a person
with two tortoises above him. 'Little-man' will be identified by the
silhouette of a child outlined above his head. This expression of proper
names hardly raises problems when it is a question of concrete things,
but it puts[]{#calibre_link-4449} the imagination of the scribe to a
hard test if he has to render abstract ideas through pictography. To
transcribe the name of a person called 'highway,' an Oglagla Indian had
recourse to the following symbolic combination: strokes parallel to
footprints make us think of 'road,' a bird painted close to it evokes
the rapidity which is evidently one of the attributes of 'good routes.'
It is clear[]{#calibre_link-4450} that only those who already know the
names corresponding to these symbols can decipher them. On that count,
these designs will have a mnemotechnic value. As another example, let us
take the proper name 'Good-Weasel.' From the animal's mouth, drawn in a
realistic fashion, emerge two wavy lines that ordinarily symbolize the
flow of words. This sign being used for 'good discourses,' it is
supposed that[]{#calibre_link-4451} the reader will only retain the
adjective and forget the idea of discourse" (EP, pp. 10--11).

turns the logico-grammatical structures of the West (and first
Aristotle's list of categories), showing that no correct description of
Chinese writing can tolerate it, Fenollosa recalled that Chinese poetry
was essentially a script. He remarked, for example: "Should we pass
formally into the study of Chinese poetry, ... we should
beware[]{#calibre_link-4453} of English *\[occidental\]* grammar, its
hard parts of speech, and its lazy satisfaction with nouns and
adjectives. We should seek and at least bear in mind the verbal
undertone of each noun. We should avoid the 'is' and bring in a wealth
of neglected English verbs. Most of the existing translations violate
all of these rules. The development of the normal transitive sentence
rests upon the fact that[]{#calibre_link-4454} one action in nature
promotes another; thus the agent and the object are secretly verbs. For
example, []{#calibre_link-857}our sentence, 'Reading promotes writing,'
would be expressed in Chinese by three full verbs. Such a form is the
equivalent of three expanded clauses and can be drawn out into
adjectival, participial, infinitive, relative or conditional members.
One of many possible examples is, 'If one reads it[]{#calibre_link-4455}
teaches him how to write.' Another is, 'One who reads becomes one who
writes.' But in the first condensed form a Chinese would write, 'Read
promote write.' " "L'écriture chinoise considerée comme art poétique,"

Rousseau*---La Baconnière---1962. A theme dear to Merleau-Ponty is
recognizable here: the work of anthropology *realizes* the imaginary
variation in search of the essential invariant.

[]{#calibre_link-297}[5](#calibre_link-664){.nounder}. The idea of an
originarily figurative language was pretty widespread at this time; it
is to be found particularly[]{#calibre_link-4462} in Warburton and in
Condillac, whose influence on Rousseau is massive in this area. As for
Vico: Bernard Gagnebin and Marcel Raymond have asked in connection with
the *Essay on the Origin of Languages*, if Rousseau had not read the
*Scienza Nuova* when he was Montaigu's secretary in Venice. But if
Rousseau and Vico both affirm the metaphoric nature of primitive
languages, Vico alone attributes to[]{#calibre_link-4463} them this
divine origin, also the theme of disagreement between Condillac and
Rousseau. Moreover, Vico is one of the rare believers, if not the only
believer, in the contemporaneity of origin between writing and speech:
"Philologists \[Derrida's version would incorrectly read
"philosophers"\] have believed that among the nations languages first
came into being and then letters; whereas ... letters
and[]{#calibre_link-4464} languages were born twins and proceeded apace
through all their three stages" (*Scienza Nuova* 3, I) *\[The New
Science of Giambattista Vico*, tr. Thomas Goddard Bergin and Max Harold
Fisch (Ithaca, 1968), p. 21\]. Cassirer does not hesitate to affirm that
Rousseau has "summarized" in the *Essay* Vico's theories on Language
(*Philosophie der symbolischen []{#calibre_link-1001}Formen* \[(Berlin,
1923--29; translated as *The Philosophy[]{#calibre_link-4465} of
Symbolic Form*, by Ralph Manheim (New Haven, 1953)\], I, I, 4).

[]{#calibre_link-299}[6](#calibre_link-665){.nounder}. "What we have
here are thus two extreme types of proper name between which there are a
whole series of intermediate cases. At one extreme, the name is an
identifying mark which, by the application of a rule, establishes that
the individual who is *named* is a member of a preordained class (a
social group in a system of groups,[]{#calibre_link-4466} a status by
birth in a system of statuses). At the other extreme, the name is a free
creation on the part of the individual who *gives the name* and
expresses a transitory and subjective state of his own by means of the
person he names. But can one be said to be really naming in either case?
The choice seems only to be between identifying someone else by
assigning him to a class or, under cover[]{#calibre_link-4467} of giving
him a name, identifying oneself through him. One therefore never names:
one classifies someone else if the name is given to him in virtue of his
characteristics and one classifies oneself if, in the belief that one
need not follow a rule, one names someone else 'freely,' that is, in
virtue of characteristics of one's own. And most commonly one does both
at once" (p. 240) \[p. 181\]. Cf. also[]{#calibre_link-4468} "The
Individual as A Species" and "Time Recaptured" ([chapters
7](#calibre_link-45){.nounder} and [8](#calibre_link-51){.nounder}): "In
every system, therefore, proper names represent the quanta of
*signification* below which one no longer does anything but point. This
brings us to the root of the parallel mistakes committed by Peirce and
by Russell, the former's in defining proper names as 'indices' and the
latter's in believing that he had discovered the[]{#calibre_link-4469}
logical model of proper names in demonstrative pronouns. This amounts in
effect to allowing that the act of naming belongs to a continuum in
which there is an imperceptible passage from the act of signifying to
that of pointing. I hope that I have succeeded in showing that this
passage is in fact discontinuous although each culture fixes its
thresholds differently. The natural sciences put
theirs[]{#calibre_link-4470} on the level of species, varieties or
subvarieties as the case may be. So terms of different degrees of
generality will be regarded each time as proper names" (pp. 285--86)
\[p. 215\].

Radicalizing this intention, it should perhaps be asked if it is any
longer legitimate to refer to the pre-nominal "property" of pure
"monstration"---pointing at---if pure indication, as the zero degree of
language, as[]{#calibre_link-4471} "sensible certitude," is not a myth
always already effaced by the play of difference. It should perhaps be
said of indication "proper" what Lévi-Strauss says of proper names: "At
the lower end there is no external limit to the system either, since it
succeeds in treating the qualitative diversity of natural species as the
symbolic material of an order, and its progress towards the concrete,
particular[]{#calibre_link-4472} and individual is not even arrested by
the obstacle of personal appellations: even proper names can serve as
terms for a classification" (p. 288) \[p. 218\] (cf. also p. 242) \[pp.
182--83\].

[]{#calibre_link-300}[7](#calibre_link-666){.nounder}. \[Pp. 269--70\].
Since we read Rousseau in the transparence of the texts, why not slide
under this scene that other taken out of a *Promenade* (9)? In spelling
out all its elements one by one and minutely, I
shall[]{#calibre_link-4473} be less attentive to the opposition of term
to term than to the rigorous symmetry of such an opposition. Everything
happens as if Rousseau had developed the reassuring positive whose
impression Lévi-Strauss gives us in the negative. Here is the scene:
"But, soon weary of emptying my purse to make people crush each other, I
left the good company and went to walk alone in the fair. The variety
of[]{#calibre_link-4474} the objects there amused me for a long time. I
perceived among others five or six boys from Savoy, around a small girl
who had still on her tray a dozen meagre apples, which she was anxious
to get rid of; the Savoyards, on their side, would have gladly freed her
of them; but they had only two or three pence among them all, and that
was not much to make a great breach among the apples. This
tray[]{#calibre_link-4475} was for them the garden of the Hesperides;
and the young girl was the dragon who guarded it. This comedy amused me
for a long time; I finally created a climax by paying for the apples
from the young girl and distributing them among the small boys. I had
then one of the finest spectacles that can flatter a man's heart, that
of seeing joy united with the innocence of youth, spreading everywhere
about[]{#calibre_link-4476} me. For the spectators themselves, in seeing
it, partook of it, and I, who shared at such cheap expense this
happiness, had in addition the joy of feeling that it was my work"
(*Pléiade*, I, pp. 1092--93; *\[The Reveries of a Solitary*, tr. John
Gould Fletcher (New York, 1927), pp. 184--85\]).

[]{#calibre_link-859}[]{#calibre_link-301}[8](#calibre_link-667){.nounder}.
Of that word and that concept which, as I had suggested at the outset,
has sense only within the logocentric[]{#calibre_link-4477} closure and
the metaphysics of presence. When it does not imply the possibility of
an intuitive or judicative *adequation*, it nevertheless continues in
*aletheia* to privilege the instance of a vision filled and satisfied by
presence. It is the same reason that prevents the thought of writing to
be simply contained within a science, indeed an epistemological circle.
It can have neither that ambition[]{#calibre_link-4478} nor that
modesty.

[]{#calibre_link-302}[9](#calibre_link-668){.nounder}. A situation
difficult to describe in Rousseauist terms, the professed absence of
writing complicating things yet further: *The Essay on the Origin of
Languages* would perhaps give the name "savagery" to the state of
society and writing described by Lévi-Strauss: "These three ways of
writing correspond almost exactly to three different stages according to
which one can consider[]{#calibre_link-4479} men gathered into a nation.
The depicting of objects is appropriate to a savage people; signs of
words and of propositions, to a barbaric people, and the alphabet to
civilized peoples *\[peuples polic*é*s\]"* \[p. 17\].

free from his first chains, and Buddhist criticism, which completes that
liberation, there is neither opposition nor contradiction. (The Marxist
teaches that the apparent significance of Man's
condition[]{#calibre_link-4484} will vanish the moment he agrees to

all the *Conversations*, pp. 28--29 \[pp. 24--26\]; in
developing[]{#calibre_link-4485} at length the image of the gambler at
the roulette wheel, Lévi-Strauss explains that the complex combination
that constitutes Western civilization, with its type of historicity,
determined by the use of writing, could very well have developed at the
beginning of humanity, it could have developed very much later, it
developed at this moment, "there is no reason why this should be so, it
just is. However,[]{#calibre_link-4486} you may say: 'That is not very
satisfactory.' " This chance is soon after determined as the
"acquisition of writing." This is an hypothesis that Lévi-Strauss
admittedly does not abide by but of which he says "we should begin by
considering it as a possibility." Even if it does not imply a belief in
chance (cf. *The Savage Mind*, pp. 22 and 291 \[pp. 13--14 and 220\]), a
certain structuralism must invoke[]{#calibre_link-4487} it in order to
inter-relate the absolute specificities of structural totalities. We
shall see how this necessity is also imposed on Rousseau.

a small subgroup which is followed by the anthropologist only in its
nomadic period. This subgroup has a sedentary life as well. In the
introduction to the thesis one will find: "It is unnecessary to
emphasize that this is not an exhaustive[]{#calibre_link-4488} study of
Nambikwara life and society. We were able to share the life of the
natives only during []{#calibre_link-852}the nomadic period, and that
alone would suffice to limit the range of our investigation. A voyage
undertaken during the sedentary period would no doubt bring essential
pieces of information and would correct the whole view. We hope one day
to be able to undertake it" (p. 3). Is this limitation,
which[]{#calibre_link-4489} seems to have been definitive, not
particularly significant with respect to the question of writing, which
is clearly linked more intimately than most things and in an essential
way, with the phenomenon of sedentarity?

writing has existed as an institution in societies in which the vast
majority of people are quite unable to write. The villages where I
stayed in the Chittagong[]{#calibre_link-4491} hills in Pakistan \[now
Bangladesh\] are populated by illiterates; yet each village has a scribe
who fulfills his function for the benefit both of individual citizens
and of the village as a whole. They all know what writing is and, if
need be, *can* write: but they do it from outside as if it were a
mediator, foreign to themselves, with which they communicate by an oral
process. But the scribe is[]{#calibre_link-4492} rarely a functionary or
an employee of the group as a whole; his knowledge is a source of
power---so much so, in fact, that the functions of scribe and usurer are
often united in the same human being. This is not merely because the
usurer needs to be able to read and write to carry on his trade, but
because he has thus a twofold *empire over* his fellows" (p. 342) \[pp.

paper."

Recalling, in "A Little Glass of Rum," that "In the neolithic age, Man
had already made most of the inventions which are indispensable to his
security. We have seen why writing need not be included among these,"
Lévi-Strauss remarks that man in earlier times was certainly "no more
free than he is today." "But it was his humanness alone which kept him
enslaved. As he had only a very restricted control[]{#calibre_link-4495}
over Nature, he was protected, and to a certain degree emancipated, by
the protective cushion of his dreams" (p. 452) \[p. 390\]. Cf. also the

represents a natural life even more animated than the plant, but one can
only deal with it dead. "The study of animals is nothing without

[]{#calibre_link-333}[4](#calibre_link-693){.nounder}. Ibid. Without
looking for a principle of reading there, I refer, out of curiosity and
from among many other possible examples, to what Karl Abraham says of
the Cyclops, of the fear of being blind,[]{#calibre_link-4501} of the
eye, of the sun, of masturbation etc. in *Oeuvres compl*è*tes*, tr. Ilse
Barande \[and E. Grin (Payot, 1965)\] II, pp. 18 f. Let us recall that
in a sequence of Egyptian mythology, Seth, helper of Thoth (god of
writing here considered as a brother of Osiris), kills Osiris by
trickery (cf. Vandier, op. cit., p. 46). Writing, auxiliary and
suppletory, kills the father and light in the same
gesture[]{#calibre_link-4502} (Cf. supra, p. 101, 328--29 n. 31).

[]{#calibre_link-335}[5](#calibre_link-694){.nounder}. " 'Little one'
was my name; 'Mama' was hers; and we always remained 'Little one' and
'Mama,' even when advancing years had almost obliterated the difference
between us. I find that these two names give a wonderfully good idea of
the tone of our intercourse, of the simplicity of our manners, and,
above all, of the mutual relation of our hearts. For me
she[]{#calibre_link-4503} was the tenderest of mothers, who never sought
her own pleasure, but always what was best for me; and if sensuality
entered at all into her attachment for me, it did not alter its
character, but only rendered it more enchanting, and intoxicated me with
the delight of having a young and pretty mamma whom it was delightful to
me to caress---I say caress in the strictest sense of the word, for it
never[]{#calibre_link-4504} occurred to her to be sparing of kisses and
the tenderest caresses of a mother, and it certainly never entered my
mind to abuse them. It will be objected that, in the end, we had
relations of a different character; I admit it, but I must wait a
little---I cannot say all at once" (p. 106) \[p. 109\]. Let us add this
sentence from Georges Bataille: "I am myself the 'little one,' I have
only a hidden place"[]{#calibre_link-4505} (*Le petit \[2d* edition
(Paris, 1963), p. 9\]).

[]{#calibre_link-336}[6](#calibre_link-695){.nounder}. This passage is
often cited, but has it ever been analyzed for itself? The Pléiade
editors of the *Confessions*, Gagnebin and Raymond, are no doubt right
in being cautious, as they are, systematically and inevitbaly, of what
they call psychiatry (note p. 1281. This same note checks off very
usefully all the texts where Rousseau recalls his
"follies"[]{#calibre_link-4506} or "extravagances.") But this caution is
not legitimate, it seems to me, except to the extent that it concerns
the abuse---which has hitherto no doubt been confounded with the
use---of psychoanalytic reading, and where it does not prescribe the
duplication of the usual commentary which has rendered this kind of text
most often unreadable. We must distinguish here between, on the one
hand, the often[]{#calibre_link-4507} hasty and careless, but often also
enlightening, analyses by Dr. René Laforgue ("Etude sur J.-J, Rousseau,"
in *Revue fran*ç*aise de psychanalyse*, I, ii \[1927\], pp. 370 f.; and
*Psychopathologie de l'échec* \[1944\], \[Paris\], pp. 114 f.), which
moreover do not consider the texts I have just cited, and, on the other
hand, an interpretation which would take into more rigorous account, at
least in principle,[]{#calibre_link-4508} the teachings of
psychoanalysis. That is one of the directions in which Jean
Starobinski's fine and careful analyses are engaged. Thus, in *L'oeil
vivant*, the sentence that has given us pause is reinscribed within an
entire series of examples of analogous substitution, borrowed mostly
from the *Nouvelle Héloise;* this one for example, among other "erotic
fetishes": "All the parts of your scattered[]{#calibre_link-4509} dress
present to my ardent imagination those of your body that they conceal.
This delicate headdress which sets off the large blond curls which it
pretends to cover; this happy bodice shawl against which at least once I
shall not have to complain; this elegant and simple gown which displays
so well the taste of the wearer; these dainty slippers that a supple
foot fills so easily; this corset so[]{#calibre_link-4510} slender which
touches and embraces ... what an enchanting form ... in front two gentle
curves ... oh voluptuous sight ... the whalebone has yielded to the
force of the impression ... delicious imprints, let me kiss you a
thousand times!" (p. 147 \[tr. Judith H. McDowell (University Park and
London, 1968), pp. 122--23\].

[]{#calibre_link-955}But do the singularity of these substitutions and
the articulation of these displacements[]{#calibre_link-4511} hold the
attention of the interpreter? I wonder if, too concerned with reacting
against a reductionist, causalist, dissociative psychology, Starobinski
does not in general give too much credit to a totalitarian
psychoanalysis of the phenomenological or existentialist style. Such a
psychoanalysis, diffusing sexuality in the totality of behavior, perhaps
risks blurring the cleavages, the differences,[]{#calibre_link-4512} the
displacements, the fixations of all sorts that structure that totality.
Do the place or the places of sexuality not disappear in the analysis of
global behavior, as Starobinski recommends: "Erotic behavior is not a
fragmentary given; it is the manifestation of a total individual, and it
is as such that it ought to be analyzed. Whether it is to neglect it or
to make it a privileged subject[]{#calibre_link-4513} of study, one
cannot limit exhibitionism to the sexual 'sphere': the entire
personality is revealed there, with some of its fundamental 'existential
choices.' " (*La transparence et l'obstacle*, pp. 210--11. A note refers
us to the *Phénoménologie de la perception* of \[Maurice\] Merleau-Ponty
\[(Paris, 1945); *Phenomenology of Perception*, tr. Colin Smith (New
York, 1965)\]). And does one not, in this way,[]{#calibre_link-4514}
risk determining the pathological in a very classic manner, as "excess"
thought within "existential" categories: "In the perspective of a global
analysis, it will appear that certain primary givens of consciousness
constitute at the same time the source of Rousseau's speculative
thought, and the source of his follly. But these given-sources are not
morbid by themselves. It is only because they[]{#calibre_link-4515} are
lived in an excessive manner, that the malady declares itself and is
developed. ... The morbid development will realize the caricatural
placing in evidence of a fundamental 'existential' question that
consciousness was not able to dominate" (p. 253).

[]{#calibre_link-338}[8](#calibre_link-698){.nounder}. In these
celebrated pages of the first Book of the *Confessions*, Rousseau
compares the first experiences of reading ("secret[]{#calibre_link-4516}
and ill-chosen reading") to the first discoveries of auto-eroticism. Not
that the "filthy and licentious \[books\]" encouraged him in it. Quite
the contrary. "Chance aided my modest disposition so well, that I was
more than thirty years old before I set eyes upon any of those dangerous
books which a fine lady finds inconvenient because they can only be read
with one hand" (p. 40) \[p. 40\]. Without[]{#calibre_link-4517} these
"dangerous books," Jean-Jacques gives himself to other dangers. The
continuation of the paragraph which closes thus is well known: "It is
sufficient for me to have defined the origin and first cause of a
propensity which has modified all my passions, and which, restraining
them by means of themselves, has always made me slow to act, owing to my
excessive impetuosity in desire" (p. 41)[]{#calibre_link-4518} \[p.
41\]. The intention and the letter of this passage should be related to
another page of the *Confessions* (p. 444 \[p. 459\]. Cf. also the
editors' note), and to the page from which I quote these lines: "for I
have always had a fancy for reading while eating, if I am alone; it
supplies the want of society. I devour alternately a page and a morsel.
It seems as if my book were dining with me" (p.[]{#calibre_link-4519}

most precise echo of this text is found, outside of the *Essay*, in the
notes grouped in the *Pléiade* edition under the title *Prononciation*
(vol. 2, p. 1248) and in the Streckeisen-Moultou edition (op. cit.),
under the title *Fragment d'un Essai sur les langues*. In his essay
Rousseau connects the degradation of morals, the
corruption[]{#calibre_link-4524} of pronunciation, and the progress of
writing. He even cites the examples of corruptions whose occurrence he
had the dubious privilege of witnessing, and which are caused by a
"fault of pronunciation in the organ, or in the intonation, or in the
habit." "Words whose change in pronunciation I have witnessed: Charolois
\[Sharolwa\]---Charolès \[Sharolay\], secret \[sucray\]---segret
\[sugray\], presécuter---\[perzcuter\],[]{#calibre_link-4525} etc." All
these matters are also to be found in the abbé Du Bos, *R*é*flexions

The examples chosen by Rousseau[]{#calibre_link-4529} are not
insignificant: "Not to mention the tenderness of mothers for their
offspring and the perils they encounter to save them from danger, it is
well known that horses show a reluctance to trample on living bodies.
One animal never passes by the dead body of another of its species
without being disturbed: there are even some which give their fellows a
sort of burial; while the mournful lowings[]{#calibre_link-4530} of the
cattle when they enter the slaughter-house show the impressions made on
them by the horrible spectacle which meets them. We find, with pleasure,
the author of *The Fable of the Bees* obliged to own that man is a
compassionate and sensible being, and laying aside his cold subtlety of
style, in the example he gives, to present us with the pathetic
description of a man who, from a place of
confinement,[]{#calibre_link-4531} is compelled to behold a wild beast
tear a child from the arms of its mother, grinding its tender limbs with
its murderous teeth, and tearing its palpitating entrails with its
claws. What horrid agitation must not the eye-witness of such a scene
experience, although he would not be personally concerned! What anxiety
would he not suffer at not being able to give any assistance to the
fainting[]{#calibre_link-4532} mother and the dying infant! Such is the
pure emotion of nature, prior to all kinds of reflection!"

[]{#calibre_link-816}[]{#calibre_link-358}[14](#calibre_link-715){.nounder}.
I ask if one may, like Derathé, oppose the doctrine of *Emile* to that
of the Second *Discourse* on this point ("In *Emile* pity becomes a
sentiment derived from the love of self whereas the second *Discourse*
would set these two principles against each other" *Le rationalisme de
J.-J. Rousseau*, pp.[]{#calibre_link-4533} 99--100).

[]{#calibre_link-359}[15](#calibre_link-716){.nounder}. It is known that
Rousseau had projected writing an entire work on the role of women in
history. It seems that for him the question was as much of restoring an
historical truth (the importance of woman's role, which the history of
man has deliberately dissimulated) as of recalling the occasionally
pernicious character of that role, through making "some observations on
great men who[]{#calibre_link-4534} have allowed themselves to be
governed by women. Themistocles, Antony, etc. Fulvia, Antony's wife,
provoked war because she was not loved by Caesar." (Cf. *Sur les femmes*
and *Essai sur les év*è*nements importants dont les femmes ont été la
cause secrète. Pléiade*, vol. 2, pp. 1254--57.)

[]{#calibre_link-360}[16](#calibre_link-717){.nounder}. \[Derrida's

Illinois, 1960), and have placed page references within brackets.\]
Garnier edition, p. 204 \[pp. 100--01\]. One should also read note 1 in
its entirety; there the author is surprised that "such pleasantry, of
which one sees sufficient application, has been taken at face value by
Frenchmen of spirit."

Second[]{#calibre_link-4536} *Discourse*, p. 159. On the subject of the

Voltaire, Buffon, or Pufendorf, see the notes in the *Pléiade* edition,
pp. 158--59.

[]{#calibre_link-364}[18](#calibre_link-719){.nounder}. *Letter to M.
d'Alembert*, pp. 206--07 \[pp. 103--04\]. See also the note on p. 206
\[p. 103\]. It begins thus: "Women, in general, do not like any art,
know nothing about any, and have no genius." "In the
union[]{#calibre_link-4537} of the sexes ... the man should be strong
and active; the woman should be weak and passive" (*Emile*, p. 446) \[p.
322\].

Is it not remarkable that Nietzsche, sharing completely this conception
of femininity, of the degradation of culture, and of the genealogy of
morals as servitude to the slave, should have hated Rousseau? Is it not
remarkable that he thought Rousseau an eminent representative
of[]{#calibre_link-4538} the slave morality? Is it not remarkable that
he should have seen precisely in pity the true subversion of culture and
the form of servitude of the masters?

There is much to say along this line. It will lead us in particular to a
comparison of the Rousseauist and Nietzschean models of femininity;
domination or seduction is equally feared, whether it takes,
alternatively or simultaneously, the[]{#calibre_link-4539} form of
cloying sweetness, or of destructive or devouring fury. It would be a
mistake to interpret these models as *simple* affirmations of virility.
Perhaps Novalis saw more profoundly and beyond what Rousseau himself
calls at the beginning of *The Confessions* (p. 12) \[p. 10\] his
"character so effeminate." "Rousseau's *philosoph*è*mes* are, absolutely
speaking, a feminine philosophy or a theory of
femininity"[]{#calibre_link-4540} (*Encyclop*é*die*, tr. M. de
Gandillac, Edition de Minuit, p. 361).

[]{#calibre_link-365}[19](#calibre_link-720){.nounder}. Cf. Derathé, *Le
rationalisme de Rousseau*, most especially pp. 30 f.

[]{#calibre_link-367}[20](#calibre_link-721){.nounder}. Derathé recalls
that "Durkheim is ... the first to have indicated the importance of this
notion of potential faculty in Rousseau." *Le rationalisme de Rousseau*,
p. 13. Cf. \[Emile\] Durkehim, "Le Contrat social, histoire du livre,"
*Revue de métaphysique et du[]{#calibre_link-4541} morale*, xxv, i & ii,
(Jan.-Feb. 1918), pp. 1--23, 129--61. Most of Rousseau's systematic
contradictions would be resolved by bringing into play this concept of a
potential faculty which operates as a solder at every point of rupture,
and primarily at the points where society breaks---and articulates
itself---with Nature. Cf. Derathé, *Rousseau et la science politique de
son temps*, p. 148. It is remarkable[]{#calibre_link-4542} that this
theme of *potentiality* should be so often misunderstood, wherever it
crops up. This misunderstanding is at the center of the problematics of
innate ideas, and of Locke's relationship with Leibniz, or Leibniz's
with Descartes.

[]{#calibre_link-368}[21](#calibre_link-722){.nounder}. Naturally, this
argument is marked by a reflection that would associate Kant and
Rousseau differently from the chapter on morality. The entire chain that
makes[]{#calibre_link-4543} possible the communication of the movement
of temporalization and the schematism of imagination, pure sensibility
and the auto-affection of the present by itself, all that
[]{#calibre_link-841}Heidegger's reading has strongly repeated in *Kant
and the Problem of Metaphysics* could, by way of a carefully staked out
path, lead us back on to Rousseauist ground.

[]{#calibre_link-369}[22](#calibre_link-723){.nounder}. The *Essay*
allows us to believe as little in original[]{#calibre_link-4544} war as
in the Golden Age. From these two points of view, the *Essay* matches
the great Rousseauist theses. In the Geneva manuscript (the first
version of *The Social Contract*, dating from 1756), Rousseau writes
that "the golden age was always a condition alien to the human race."

[]{#calibre_link-370}[23](#calibre_link-724){.nounder}. Pages 153--54
\[pp. 181---82; Cole's note: Justin, *Hist*. ii, 2. So much more does
the ignorance of vice profit the one[]{#calibre_link-4545} sort than the
knowledge of virtue the other.\] Cf. also p. 152 and the fragment on
*L'état de nature:* "As long as men retained their first innocence, they
needed no guide other than the voice of Nature; as long as they did not
become evil, they were dispensed from being good" (\[Pléiade, vol. 3,\]
p. 476).

[]{#calibre_link-371}[24](#calibre_link-725){.nounder}. The textual
unity of this doctrine of pity is confirmed once again if these four
passages[]{#calibre_link-4546} are placed side by side: "Although pity
is native to the human heart, it would remain eternally quiescent unless
it were activated by imagination. How are we moved to pity? By getting
outside ourselves and identifying with a being who suffers. We suffer
only as much as we believe him to suffer. It is not in ourselves, but in
him that we suffer" (*Essay*) \[p. 32\].

"So pity is born, the first relative[]{#calibre_link-4547} sentiment
which touches the human heart according to the order of nature. To
become sensitive and pitiful the child must know that he has
fellow-creatures who suffer as he has suffered, who feel the pains he
has felt, and others which he can form some idea of, being capable of
feeling them himself. Indeed, how can we let ourselves be stirred by
pity unless we go beyond ourselves, and identify[]{#calibre_link-4548}
ourselves with the suffering animal, by leaving, so to speak, our own
nature and taking his. We only suffer so far as we suppose he suffers;
the suffering is not ours but his. So no one becomes sensitive till his
imagination is aroused and begins to carry him outside himself"
(*Emile*, p. 261) \[p. 184\].

"It is clear that such transport supposes a great deal of acquired
knowledge. How am I to imagine[]{#calibre_link-4549} ills of which I
have no idea? How would I suffer in seeing another suffer, if I know not
what he is suffering, if I am ignorant of what he and I have in common.
He who has never been reflective is incapable of being malicious and
vindictive. He who imagines nothing is aware only of himself; he is
isolated in the midst of mankind" (*Essay*) \[p. 32\].

"To show the means by which he may be kept in[]{#calibre_link-4550} the
path of nature is to show plainly enough how he might stray from that
path. So long as his consciousness is confined to himself there is no
morality in his actions; it is only when it begins to extend beyond
himself that he forms first the sentiments and then the ideas of good
and ill, which make him indeed a man, and an integral part of his
species" (*Emile*, p. 257) \[p. 181\].

[]{#calibre_link-375}[28](#calibre_link-729){.nounder}. That was also
the conclusion of H. Baudouin (*La vie[]{#calibre_link-4552} et les
oeuvres de Jean-Jacques Rousseau* \[Paris, 1891\]). The page he devotes
to the *Essay* shows how Rousseau, and notably the *Essay*, might then
have normally been read, and allows us to measure the distance to be
covered: "Between the *Discourse on the Sciences* and the *Discourse on
Inequality*, one must place *The Essay on the Origin of Languages*.
Rousseau also gave it the title of Essay on the
*Principle[]{#calibre_link-4553} of Melody*. In fact in it he deals
equally with language and music; which does not stop him from speaking a
great deal about society and its origins. ... The date of its
composition is not perfectly clear; but the context indicates it
sufficiently. Even the passages therein where Rousseau speaks of the
pernicious role of the arts and sciences show that his opinions were
already decided on this point:[]{#calibre_link-4554} it is well-known
that he was yet hesitant at the time of composition of his discourse. He
therefore could have written the *Essay* only at a later date. On the
other hand, it is easy to see that on the question of society he had not
yet formed those radical ideas which he professed in his book on
Inequality. (The quotation from the *Lettre sur les spectacles* in
[]{#calibre_link-977}a note to [Chapter 1](#calibre_link-10){.nounder}
is not a serious[]{#calibre_link-4555} enough objection. Nothing is
simpler, in fact, than a note added after the event.) Such as it is, the
*Essay* offers a curious enough mixture of truth and falsehood, caution
and audacity. The method is constantly hypothetical, there are no
proofs, the social doctrines are at the very least mediocre. Often one
would believe one were reading the *Inequality:* same style, same turn
of phrase, same investigative[]{#calibre_link-4556} procedures, same
sequences of reasoning and ideas. But in the midst of all this, there is
such caution in the conclusions, such a respect for Holy Writ and
tradition, such a faith in Providence, such a horror of the materialist
philosophers, that one finds oneself disarmed, as it were. In sum then,
Rousseau has created a transitional work here, which presages evil,
rather than producing[]{#calibre_link-4557} it fully. The good that he
placed there might have led him to saner ideas, if he had known how to
make use of it; unhappily enough he placed there the germs of those
errors which he developed in his later works. A memorable example of the
care that one must take in order somehow to orient his talent and life
well, and what sort of route a principle, pushed to its extreme
consequences by an extremist[]{#calibre_link-4558} logic, would carve
out" (vol. I, pp. 323--34).

[]{#calibre_link-377}[30](#calibre_link-731){.nounder}. "This is how
Rousseau's work appears to me: very diverse, tumultuous, agitated by all
sorts of fluctuations, and yet, beginning from a certain moment,
continuous and constant in its spirit, in its successive directions.
..." And opposing *the writer or the man*,
"dreamer[]{#calibre_link-4559} and timid," to the work which "lives with
an independent life," moving by "its intrinsic properties" and "quite
charged with revolutionary explosives," leading equally to "anarchy,"
and "social despotism," Lanson concludes: "We must not try to hide this
contrast of man and work, which may even be called contradiction; for
that is Rousseau himself." Is it still necessary to specify that what
interests[]{#calibre_link-4560} us in Rousseau, and here in Lanson, is
the obstinate veiling of this "critical" unveiling of the
"contradiction" between the man and the work? Allowing us the concession
of a certain internal contradiction, what is hidden from us under this
"Rousseau himself?" Where and when is one assured that there would have
to be something that fits the proposition "that is Rousseau himself?"

[]{#calibre_link-378}[31](#calibre_link-732){.nounder}. That
was[]{#calibre_link-4561} Lanson's opinion as well and he finally came
to agree with Masson.

[]{#calibre_link-379}[32](#calibre_link-733){.nounder}. "Note, in
particular, that the long note to [Chapter
7](#calibre_link-45){.nounder} was added and that the entire [Chapter
6](#calibre_link-31){.nounder} \['Whether It Is Likely That Homer Knew
How to Write'\] was considerably revised. In the first draft, Rousseau
thought it very probable that Homer did not know writing (pp. 29--30 of
the manuscript). Rereading his text, he struck out[]{#calibre_link-4562}
that passage and added in the margin: 'N. B. This is a stupidity that
one must avoid, since the story of Bellerophon, in the *Iliad* itself,
proves that the art of writing was in use in the author's time, but this
would not prevent his work from being more sung than written' "
(Masson's Note. The examination of the manuscript seemed less fruitful
to me than Masson seems to think).

publishing[]{#calibre_link-4563} the final text at which Rousseau seems
provisionally to have stopped, for the Preface remains unfinished. ...
This Preface had already been published by A. Jansens, in his J.-J.

and faults of reading which characterize most of his publications of
texts" (Extract from Masson's notes).

[]{#calibre_link-381}[34](#calibre_link-735){.nounder}. Here is a
passage that relates to the[]{#calibre_link-4564} distinction between
animal and human languages, which the *Essay* equates with the
distinction between non-perfectibility and perfectibility: "That single
distinction would seem to be far-reaching. It is said to be explicable
by organic differences. I would be curious to see such an explanation"
(end of Chapter I) \[p. 10\].

[]{#calibre_link-383}[35](#calibre_link-736){.nounder}. Is it useful to
indicate here that we find the same problematics
of[]{#calibre_link-4565} example and a literally identical formulation
in *The Critique of Practical Reason*, certainly, but above all in the
*Metaphysische Anfangsgr*ü*nde der Tugendlehre* (1797) \[translated as
*The Principles of Virtue: [Part II](#calibre_link-101){.nounder} of The
Metaphysics of Morals*, by James Ellington (New York, 1964)\], which
distinguishes between the example as the particular case of a practical
rule (*Exempel*) and the example as the[]{#calibre_link-4566} particular
instance of the purely "theoretical presentation of a concept
(*Beispiel)"* (§52 \[p. 148\]), and in the notes to *Uber
[]{#calibre_link-1032}Pedagogik* \[translated as *The Educational Theory
of Immanuel Kant*, by Edward Franklin Buchner (Philadelphia, 1908)\],
published in 1803?

[]{#calibre_link-384}[36](#calibre_link-737){.nounder}. "Mons. Rameau,
insisting absolutely, in his system, that all our harmony should be
drawn from nature, has had recourse, for this
purpose,[]{#calibre_link-4567} to another experience of his own
invention. ... But first, the experience is false. ... Though we should
suppose the truth of this experience, this would be very far from
removing the difficulties. If, as Mons. Rameau pretends, the whole of
harmony is derived from the resonance of a sonorous body, it does not
then derive from it the single vibrations of a sonorous body which does
not resound.[]{#calibre_link-4568} In effect, it is a strange theory to
derive from what does not resound, the principles of harmony; and it is
strange in physic, to make a sonorous body vibrate and not resound, as
if the sound itself was at all different from the air, shaken by these
vibrations" \[pp. 343--44\].

[]{#calibre_link-385}[37](#calibre_link-738){.nounder}. Cf., for
example, *The Confessions*, p. 334 \[pp. 343--44\].

[]{#calibre_link-386}[38](#calibre_link-739){.nounder}. "When we
reflect, that of all the people of the earth,[]{#calibre_link-4569} who
all have a music and an air, the Europeans are the only ones who have a
harmony and concords, and who find this mixture agreeable; when we
reflect, that the world has continued so many years, without, amongst
the cultivation of the beaux arts throughout mankind in general, any
one's having known this harmony; that no animal, no bird, no being in
nature, produces any other concord than the
unison,[]{#calibre_link-4570} no other music than melody; that the
eastern languages, so sonorous, so musical; that the Greek air, so
delicate, so sensible, exercised with so much art, have never guided
these voluptuous people, fond of our harmony, that without it, their
music had such prodigious effects, that with it, ours is so weak; that
lastly, if it was reserved for the northern nations, whose rough and
brutal organs[]{#calibre_link-4571} are more touched with the eclat and
noise of the voice, than with sweetness of the accent, and the melody of
the inflections, to make this vast discovery, and to give it as a
foundation of all the rules in art: When I say, we pay attention to the
whole of this, it is very difficult not to suspect that all our harmony
is but a gothic and barbarous invention, which we should never have
followed if[]{#calibre_link-4572} we had been more sensible of the true
beauties of art, and of music truly natural. Mons. Rameau, however,
pretends that harmony is the source of the greatest beauties in music;
but this opinion has been contradicted by facts and reason.---By facts,
because all the great effects of music have ceased, and it has lost all
its energy and force since the invention of the counter point; to which
I add, that[]{#calibre_link-4573} beauties purely harmonic, are
ingenious beauties, which please only persons versed in the art; whereas
the true beauties of music, being those of nature, are, and ought to be,
equally sensible to every man, whether learned or ignorant.

"By reason, because harmony furnishes no imitation by which music,
forming images, or expressing sentiments, may be raised to the dramatic
or imitative genus,[]{#calibre_link-4574} which is the most noble part
of art, and the only one energetic. Every thing that expresses only the
physic of sounds, being greatly bounded in the pleasure which it gives
us, and having very little power over the human heart" (*Dictionary*)
\[pp. 191--92\].

Let us note in passing that Rousseau admits to two things that he
elsewhere denies: 1. That the beauties of music are natural; 2. that
there[]{#calibre_link-4575} is an animal song, a song merely melodic, to
be sure, but consequently absolutely pure. Thus the meaning and function
of the contradiction within the handling of the concepts of nature and
animality are confirmed: music, for example, does not become what it
is---human---and does not transgress animality except through what
threatens it with death: harmony.

[]{#calibre_link-387}[39](#calibre_link-740){.nounder}. Chapter 13, "On
Melody," is almost entirely[]{#calibre_link-4576} given over to
painting. We must cite this remarkable page in extenso. Now more than
ever, it is possible to comment on its irony in more than one sense:
"Imagine a country in which no one has any idea of drawing, but where
many people who spend their lives combining and mixing various shades of
color are considered to excel at painting. Those people would regard our
painting precisely as we[]{#calibre_link-4577} consider Greek music. If
they heard of the emotions aroused in us by beautiful paintings, the
spell of a pathetic scene, their scholars would rush into a ponderous
investigation of the material, comparing their colors to ours,
determining whether our green is more delicate or our red more
brilliant. They would try to find out which color combinations drew
tears, which could arouse anger. The Burettes[]{#calibre_link-4578} of
that []{#calibre_link-872}country would examine just a few tattered
scraps of our paintings. Then they would ask with surprise what is so
remarkable about such coloring.

"And, if a start were made in a neighboring country toward the
development of line and stroke, an incipient drawing, some still
imperfect figure, it would all be treated as merely capricious, baroque
daubing. And, for the sake of taste, one would[]{#calibre_link-4579}
cling to this simple style, which really expresses nothing, but
brilliantly produces beautiful nuances, big slabs of color, long series
of gradually shaded hues, without a hint of drawing.

"Finally, the power of progress would lead to experiments with the
prism. And immediately some famous artist would base a beautiful system
on it. Gentlemen, he will tell you, true philosophy requires that
things[]{#calibre_link-4580} be traced to physical causes. Behold the
analysis of light; behold the primary colors; observe their relations,
their proportions. These are the true principles of the pleasure that
painting gives you. All this mysterious talk of drawing, representation,
figure, is just the charlatanry of French painters who think that by
their imitations they can produce I know not what stirrings of the
spirit,[]{#calibre_link-4581} while it is known that nothing is involved
by sensation. You hear of the marvels of their pictures; but look at my
colors" \[pp. 53--54\].

And Rousseau prolongs yet further the imaginary discourse of this
foreigner who is in fact nothing other than the
correspondent---foreigner and theoretician of painting---of a French
musician and musicographer, Rameau's analogue. "French painters, he
would continue,[]{#calibre_link-4582} may have seen a rainbow. Nature
may have given them some taste for nuance, some sense of color. But I
have revealed to you the great and true principles of art. I say of art!
of all the arts, gentlemen, and of all the sciences. The analysis of
colors, the calculation of prismatic refractions, give you the only
exact relations in nature, the rule of all relations. And everything in
the universe[]{#calibre_link-4583} is nothing but relations. Thus one
knows everything when one knows how to paint; one knows everything when
one knows how to match colors.

"What are we to say to a painter sufficiently devoid of feeling and
taste to think like that, stupidly restricting the pleasurable character
of his art to its mere mechanics? What shall we say of a musician,
similarly quite prejudiced, who considers harmony[]{#calibre_link-4584}
the sole source of the great effect of music. Let us consign the first
to housepainting and condemn the other to doing French opera" \[p. 55\].

[]{#calibre_link-388}[40](#calibre_link-741){.nounder}. It is in that
passage of the first book which explains how "in this manner I learnt to
covet in silence, to dissemble, to lie, and, lastly, to steal" (p. 32)
\[p. 30\]. For various reasons the following passage, coming a little
before the above, appears[]{#calibre_link-4585} to me to be worth
rereading at this point: "The trade in itself was not disagreeable to
me: I had a decided taste for drawing; the handling of a graving-tool
amused me; and as the claims upon the skill of a watchmaker's engraver
were limited. I hoped to attain perfection. I should, perhaps, have done
so, had not my master's brutality and excessive restraint disgusted me
with my work. I stole some[]{#calibre_link-4586} of my working hours to
devote to similar occupations, but which had for me the charm of
freedom. I engraved medals for an order of knighthood for myself and my
companions. My master surprised me at this contraband occupation, and
gave me a sound thrashing, declaring that I was training for a coiner,
because our medals bore the arms of the Republic. I can swear that I had
no idea at all of bad,[]{#calibre_link-4587} and only a very faint one
of good, money. I knew better how the Roman As was made than our
three-sou pieces" \[p. 30\].

[]{#calibre_link-391}[41](#calibre_link-742){.nounder}. The closest
reference here leads to Condillac. Cf. the chapter "On the Origin of
Poetry," in *An Essay on the Origin of Human Knowledge* (1756).

[]{#calibre_link-394}[42](#calibre_link-743){.nounder}. This fragment,
the manuscript of which is lost, was published in 1861 by
Streckeisen-Moultou. It is reprinted in the
Pléiade[]{#calibre_link-4588} edition of the *Political Fragments* (vol.
III, p. 529), under the title "L'influence des climats sur la
civilisation."

[]{#calibre_link-395}[43](#calibre_link-744){.nounder}. Rousseau adds in
a note: "Turkish is a northern tongue" \[p. 49 n. 1\].

[]{#calibre_link-396}[44](#calibre_link-745){.nounder}. The word
*"suppléer"* \[to compensate\] appears also in the text on
*Pronunciation* in connection with accent (p. 1249).

[]{#calibre_link-397}[45](#calibre_link-746){.nounder}. Cf. also the
*Projet concernant de nouveaux signes pour la musique* (1742), the

may perhaps suppose that as I am in no hurry to teach
[]{#calibre_link-814}Emile to read and write, I shall not want to teach
him to read music"), and J. Starobinski, *La transparence et
l'obstacle*, pp. 177 f.

[]{#calibre_link-398}[46](#calibre_link-747){.nounder}. With regard to
the oratorical intonation which "modifies the very substance of
discourse, without[]{#calibre_link-4590} perceptibly altering prosodic
accent," Duclos concludes: "In writing we mark interrogation and
surprise; but how many movements of the soul, and consequently how many
oratorical inflections, do we possess, that have no written signs, and
that only intelligence and sentiment may make us grasp! Such are the
inflections that mark anger, scorn, irony, etc., etc." (p. 416).

[]{#calibre_link-400}[47](#calibre_link-748){.nounder}. Cf. Derathé,

[]{#calibre_link-401}[48](#calibre_link-749){.nounder}. Jean Mosconi
shows that the state of pure Nature is not absent from the *Essay* and
that the "age of 'huts' has ... in the two texts, nothing comparable,"
"Analyse et genèse: regards sur la théorie du devenir de l'entendement
au XVII^e^ siècle," *Cahiers pour l' analyse*, 4, \[Sept.-Oct., 1966\]:
75.

[]{#calibre_link-402}[49](#calibre_link-750){.nounder}. In its elements
at least, this argument does not[]{#calibre_link-4592} belong to
Rousseau. It owes a great deal particularly to Condillac's *Essay on the
Origin of Human Knowledge* (the first section on "The Origin and
Progress of Language"). Through Condillac, we are also brought back to
Warburton (op. cit.). Probably also to the
[]{#calibre_link-4593}[]{#calibre_link-4594}*Réflexions critiques sur la
poésie et la peinture* of the abbé Du Bos (\[Paris,\] 1719) notably to
Chapter 35 on the origin of languages, and to the *Rhétorique \[ou l'
Art de Pârler*, third edition (Paris, 1688)\] of Father Lamy who is
cited elsewhere in the *Essay*. On these problems, we refer to the
*Pléiade* edition of the second *Discourse* by J. Starobinski
(especially to p. 151, n. 1) and to his fine[]{#calibre_link-4595}
analysis of the theme of the sign in *La transparence et l'obstacle*
(pp. 169 f.).

[]{#calibre_link-403}[50](#calibre_link-751){.nounder}. With regard to
the "natural language" of the child: "To the language of intonation
*\[voix\]* is added the no less forcible language of gesture. The child
uses, not its weak hands, but its face" (*Emile*, p. 45; italics added)
\[p. 32\].

[]{#calibre_link-404}[51](#calibre_link-752){.nounder}. "Psychonanalysis
will tell us that in dreams dumbness is a common
representation[]{#calibre_link-4596} of death" (Freud, "The Theme of the
Three Caskets," \[*SE* XII, 295; GW X, 24--37\]. Rousseau too says in
the *Reveries* that silence "offers us an image of death" (p. 1047).

[]{#calibre_link-405}[52](#calibre_link-753){.nounder}. One finds all
these examples once again, and presented in related terms, in Book 4 of
*Emile*. It is a praise of the economy of speech in the eloquence of
antiquity: "The most startling speeches were expressed not in words
but[]{#calibre_link-4597} in signs; they were not uttered but shown. A
thing beheld by the eyes kindles the imagination, stirs the curiosity,
and keeps the mind on the alert for what we are about to say, and often
enough the thing tells the whole story. Thrasybulus and Tarquin cutting
off the heads of the poppies, Alexander placing his seal on the lips of
his favourite, Diogenes marching before Zeno, do not these speak
more[]{#calibre_link-4598} plainly than if they had uttered long
orations? What flow of words could have expressed the ideas as clearly?"
(p. 400) \[p. 287\].

[]{#calibre_link-406}[53](#calibre_link-754){.nounder}. This story,
which all great works on writing recall, comes to us from Clement of
Alexandria and Herodotus. Rousseau had perhaps read it in Warburton's
*The Essay on Hieroglyphs:* "The story is told by *Clemens Alexandrinus*
in these Words: *It is said that* Idanthura, *[]{#calibre_link-4599}a
King of the* Scythians, *as* Pherecydes Syrius *relates it, when ready
to oppose* Darius, *who had passed the* Ister, *sent the* Persian *a
Symbol instead of Letters, namely, a Mouse, a Frog, a Bird, a Dart and a
Plow*. Thus this Message being to supply both *Speech and Writing* the
Purport of it was, we see, expressed by a Composition of *Action* and
*Picture"* \[p. 87\]. Warburton recalls Herodotus's
interpretation[]{#calibre_link-4600} (I.IV): "Darius believed that the
Scythians wanted to tell him through this enigma that they presented him
earth and water, and submitted to him. The mouse signified the earth to
those in the know; the toad signified water; the bird could be compared
to the horse; and by the arrows was meant that they were denuding
themselves of their power. But Gobrias, one of those who destroyed the
Magi,[]{#calibre_link-4601} gave another interpretation: 'If instead of
fleeing like birds, you hide yourself in the earth or water, like mice
and toads, you will perish by *these* arrows.' For Herodotus, in place
of one barb, counts five arrows and says nothing of the plough, etc. ...
I believed I would please the reader by adding this commentary of
Herodotus to Pherecydes' text" (pp. 63--65) \[my edition of
[]{#calibre_link-833}*The Divine Legation[]{#calibre_link-4602} of

"The invention of the other arts must therefore have been necessary to
compel mankind to apply themselves[]{#calibre_link-4603} to agriculture"
(p. 173) \[pp. 200--01\]. *Essay*: "The first men were hunters or
shepherds, and not tillers of the soil; herdsmen, not men of the fields.
Before the ownership of it was divided, no one thought to cultivate
land. Agriculture is an art that requires tools" (Chapter IX) \[p. 33\].

[]{#calibre_link-415}[58](#calibre_link-759){.nounder}. Although it
further sharpens the break between the state of pure Nature and the
state of budding society, the *Discourse* multiplies quite a few
allusions to "the inconceivable pains and the infinite space of time
that the first invention of languages must have cost" (p. 146) \[p.
174\], to "the rapidity of time," to the "almost insensible progress of
things in their beginnings";[]{#calibre_link-4605} "for the slower the
events were in their succession, the more rapidly may they be described"
(p. 167) \[p. 195\]. A remark that Voltaire found "ridiculous." See
editor's note in the Pléiade edition.

[]{#calibre_link-416}[59](#calibre_link-760){.nounder}. Rousseau is mote
specific in a note: "It is not possible to determine the precise degree
of man's natural indolence. It is said that he lives only to sleep, to
vegetate, to rest. Only with difficulty[]{#calibre_link-4606} can he
resolve to bestir himself enough to avoid dying of starvation. Nothing
sustains the love of so many savages for their mode of life as does this
delicious indolence. The feelings that make man restless, foresighted,
and active arise only in society. To do nothing is the primary and the
strongest passion of man after that of self-preservation. If one looks
carefully, he will see that, just[]{#calibre_link-4607} as among
ourselves, it is in order to achieve repose that everyone works. It is
laziness that even makes us hard-working" \[pp. 38--39, n. 4\].

[]{#calibre_link-417}[60](#calibre_link-761){.nounder}. Derathé has
qualified it thus (*Rousseau et la science ...*, p. 180).

[]{#calibre_link-418}[61](#calibre_link-762){.nounder}. Cf. Starobinksi,
*La transparence et l'obstacle*, pp. 190--91.

[]{#calibre_link-419}[62](#calibre_link-763){.nounder}. If the force of
dispersion can appear before and after the catastrophe, if the
catastrophe reunites men at the time[]{#calibre_link-4608} of its
appearance but disperses them anew by its persistence, the coherence of
the theory of need, under its apparent contradictions, is explained.
Before the catastrophe, need draws men apart; during the catastrophe, it
brings them together. "The earth nourishes men; but when their initial
needs have dispersed them, other needs arise which reunite them, and it
is only then that they speak, and[]{#calibre_link-4609} that they have
any incentive to speak. In order to avoid contradicting myself, I must
be allowed time to explain myself" *\[Essay*, p. 39\].

[]{#calibre_link-420}[63](#calibre_link-764){.nounder}. *Essays:* "The
cycles of the seasons are another more general and permanent cause that
is bound to produce the same effect in the climates subject to this
variety" \[p. 40\]. *Fragment* on climates: "A different diversity that
multiplies and combines the preceding[]{#calibre_link-4610} is that of
the seasons. Their succession, containing several climates alternately
within a single one, accustoms men who live there to their diverse
impressions, and renders them capable of traveling and living in all
countries of which the temperature is felt in theirs" (p. 531).

[]{#calibre_link-421}[64](#calibre_link-765){.nounder}. This description
of the festival should be compared to that in the *Letter to d'Alembert*
and, more specifically[]{#calibre_link-4611} as far as time is
concerned, to that in *Emile*. "We will be our own servants in order to
be our own masters. Time will fly unheeded" \[p. 318\]. A very brief
passage will lead us to the understanding that these two notations are
not juxtaposed: the possibility of the "comparison," in the sense given
to that concept by Rousseau, is the common root of temporal difference
(which permits the measurement[]{#calibre_link-4612} of time and throws
us outside of the present) and of the difference or lack of symmetry
between master and man.

never cited in \[Gaston\] Bachelard's []{#calibre_link-843}*L' eau et

[]{#calibre_link-423}[66](#calibre_link-767){.nounder}. As long as
incest is permitted, there is no incest, to be sure, but there is also
no amorous passion. Sexual relationships limit themselves to the
reproductive needs; or they do not exist at all: this is the situation
of the child as given in *Emile*. But would Rousseau say the same thing
about the child's relationship[]{#calibre_link-4614} with his mother as
he says here about his relationship with his sister? It is true that the
mother is quite absent from *Emile:* "The child brought up in accordance
with his age is alone. He knows no attachment but that of habit, he
loves his sister like his watch, and his friend like his dog. He is
unconscious of his sex and his species; men and women are alike unknown"
(p. 256) \[p. 180\].

occurred to me in skeptical moments not only that Homer knew how to
write, but that he wrote in the manner of his time. I am very sorry if
this doubt is formally contradicted by the story of Bellerophon in the
*Iliad"* \[p. 23\]. Subsequently engaged in denying the significance,
that is to say the authenticity, of the Bellerophon episode, Rousseau
pays no attention to[]{#calibre_link-4616} its meaning: that the only
piece of writing in Homer was a letter of death. Bellerophon unwittingly
carried on himself the inscription of his own death sentence. Within an
infinite chain of representations, desire carries death via the detour
of writing. "Beautiful Anteia the wife of Proitos was stricken/With
\[illicit\] passion to lie in love with him \[Bellerophon, Glaucus'
son\]." Unsucccessful,[]{#calibre_link-4617} she threatens her husband:
"Would you be killed, O Proitos? Then murder Bellerophontes/Who tried to
lie with me in love, though I was unwilling." The king, representing
Anteia's desire, dare not kill with his own hands. He does dare to
write, and deferring murder, he traces with his hand "in a folding
tablet" in "murderous symbols" (*thymophthora---\["passion-wasting"\]*)
\[the passages from the *Iliad*[]{#calibre_link-4618} are taken from the
Richmond Lattimore translation (Chicago, 1951), p. 157.\] He sends
Bellerophon to Lycea, charging him with these "fatal signs." Reading
this message, illegible to Bellerophon, Proitos's father-in-law,
reigning at Lycea, will understand that it speaks of putting the carrier
of these "symbols" to death. In his turn, he defers the murder, sends
Bellerophon to risk death through killing[]{#calibre_link-4619} the
invincible Chimaera or the famous Solymes, and lays ambushes for him. To
no end. He finishes by giving him his daughter. Later, Bellerophon is no
longer loved by the gods and he goes alone, wandering "the plain of
Aleios, eating his heart out, skulking aside from the trodden track of
humanity" (Lattimore, pp. 157--58).

[]{#calibre_link-428}[2](#calibre_link-769){.nounder}. Vico says that he
understood the origin of languages at the moment
when,[]{#calibre_link-4620} after many difficulties, it appeared to him
that the first nations "were nations of poets; by the same principles,
we first identified the true origin of languages" (*Scienza Nuova*, I:
174). The distinction among three languages would correspond, *mutatis
mutandis*, to Rousseau's schema; the second language, which marks the
appearance of both speech and metaphor, would, strictly speaking, be
the[]{#calibre_link-4621} moment of origin, when the poetic song is not
yet broken into articulation and convention. Let us compare: "Three
kinds of language were spoken which compose the vocabulary of this
Science: (1) that of the time of the families when gentile men were
newly received into humanity. This, we shall find, was a mute language
of signs and physical objects having natural relations to the ideas they
wished[]{#calibre_link-4622} to express. (2) That spoken by means of
heroic emblems, or similitudes, comparisons, images, metaphors, and
natural descriptions, which make up the great body of the heroic
language which was spoken at the time the heroes reigned. (3) Human
language using words agreed upon by the people, a language of which they
are absolute lords" (3, 1, p. 32) \[Bergin, op. cit., p. 18\].
Elsewhere: "That first language[]{#calibre_link-4623} ... was not a
language in accord with the nature of the things it dealt with ... but
was a fantastic speech making use of physical substances endowed with
life and most of them imagined to be divine" (3, 1, p. 163) \[pp.
114--15\]. "We find that the principle of these
[]{#calibre_link-873}origins both of languages and of letters lies in
the fact that the early gentile peoples, by a demonstrated necessity of
nature, were[]{#calibre_link-4624} poets who spoke in poetic characters.
This discovery, which is the master key of this Science, has cost us the
persistent research of almost all our literary life" (3, *Idea of the
Work*, I: 28--29) \[p. 19\]. "Men vent great passions by breaking into
song, ... that ... they were inexpressive save under the impulse of
violent passions---\[lead to the conjecture that\] their first languages
must have been formed[]{#calibre_link-4625} in singing" (3, I: 95
\[J.-B. Vico, *Oeuvres choisies\]*, tr. \[J.\] Chaix-Ruy \[Paris,
1946\]) \[p. 69\]. "All that has been reasoned out seems clearly to
confute the common error of the grammarians, who say that *prose speech
came first and speech in verse afterward*. And within *the origins of
poetry*, as they have here been disclosed, we have found *the origins of
languages and letters"* (Book II, *Poetic[]{#calibre_link-4626} Wisdom*,
Chap. V, § 5, *\[Oeuvres choisies de Vico,\]* tr. \[J.\] Michelet
\[(Paris, 1893--99), vol. 27,\] (p. 430) \[p. 142\]. For Vico, as for
Rousseau, the progress of language follows the progress of articulation.
Thus, language suffers a fall and humanizes itself through the loss of
its poetry and its divine character: "The language of the gods was
almost entirely mute, only very slightly
articulate;[]{#calibre_link-4627} the language of the heroes, an equal
mixture of articulate and mute, ... the language of men, almost entirely
articulate and only very slightly mute" (3, I: 178, tr. Chaix-Ruy) \[p.
134\].

[]{#calibre_link-429}[3](#calibre_link-770){.nounder}. Condillac
recognized the convergence of his and Warburton's thoughts, rather than
his debt to the latter. Yet this convergence, as we shall immediately
see, is not complete: "This section was near
finished,[]{#calibre_link-4628} when I happened to light on an essay on
hieroglyphics, extracted from the second volume of Dr. Warburton's
Divine Legation of Moses; a work equally distinguished for strength of
reasoning and variety of erudition. With pleasure I found that this
author's notions and mine coincided, in supposing that language must,
from its first beginning, have been very figurative and metaphysical. My
own reflections[]{#calibre_link-4629} had led me to observe, that
writing at first could be no more than a simple picture; but I had not
as yet made any attempt to discover by what progress mankind arrived at
the invention of letters, and it seemed difficult to me to succeed in
the inquiry. The task has been exceedingly well executed by Dr.
Warburton, of whom the greatest part of this chapter has been borrowed"
(Chap. 13, "Of Writing,"[]{#calibre_link-4630} \$127, p. 177) \[p.
273.n.\].

[]{#calibre_link-430}[4](#calibre_link-771){.nounder}. [Page
195](#calibre_link-772){.nounder}. "This way of *Speaking* by *Simile*,
we may conceive to answer to the *Chinese Marks* or Characters in
*Writing;* and as from such Marks proceeded the abbreviated Method of
*Alphabetic Letters*, so from the *Similitude*, to make Language still
more expedite and elegant, came the METAPHOR; which is indeed but a
*Similitude* in little: For Men so conversant in matter
still[]{#calibre_link-4631} wanted sensible Images to convey abstract
Ideas" (*Essai sur les hiéroglyphes*, T.I, pp. 85--86) \[p. 94\]. "This,
and not the Warmth of a Poetic Fancy, as is commonly supposed, was the
true Original of figurative Expression. We see it even at this Day in
the Style of the *American* Barbarians, tho' of the coldest and most
flegmatic Complexions. ... Their *Phlegm* could only make their Stile
*concise*, not[]{#calibre_link-4632} take away the *Figures:* and the
Conjunction of these different Characters in it, shews plainly that
Metaphors were from Necessity, not Choice. ... Thus we see it has ever
been the way of Man, both in *Speech* and *Writing*, as well as in
*Clothes* and *Habitations*, to turn his Wants and Necessities into
Parade and Ornament" (pp. 195--97) \[PP. 147--48\].

[]{#calibre_link-431}[5](#calibre_link-773){.nounder}. METAPHORE, S. F.
(gram.). "M. du Marsais says that[]{#calibre_link-4633} it is a figure
by which the proper signification of a noun (I would prefer to say *a
word*) is carried over, so to speak, to another signification which is
not appropriate to it except by virtue of a comparison which is in the
mind. A word taken in its *metaphoric* sense loses its proper
signification, and acquires a new one that presents itself to the mind
only by the comparison undertaken between[]{#calibre_link-4634} the
proper meaning of the word and what one compares it to: for example,
when one says that falsehood often decks itself in the colors of truth."
And after long quotations from Marsais: "I have sometimes heard M. du
Marsais reproached for being a little prolix; and I realize that it is
possible, for example, to give fewer examples of *metaphor*, and to
develop them less extensively; but who has[]{#calibre_link-4635} no wish
at all for such a happy prolixity? The author of a dictionary of
language cannot read this article []{#calibre_link-885}on the metaphor
without being struck by the astonishing exactitude of our grammarian in
distinguishing the proper meaning from a figurative one, and in
assigning to one the foundation of the other."

[]{#calibre_link-432}[6](#calibre_link-774){.nounder}. On this point,
Rousseau's doctrine is most Cartesian. It is itself interpreted as a
justification[]{#calibre_link-4636} of Nature. The senses, which are
natural, never deceive us. On the contrary, it is our judgment that
misleads us and plays Nature false. "Nature never deceives us; we
deceive ourselves"---a passage from *Emile* (p. 237) \[p. 166\] which
the autograph manuscript replaces with the following: "I say it is
impossible for our senses to deceive us because it is always true that
we feel what we feel." The[]{#calibre_link-4637} Epicureans are praised
for having recognized this but criticized for having maintained that
"the judgments that we made about our sensations were never false." "We
sense our sensations, but we do not sense our judgments."

[]{#calibre_link-433}[7](#calibre_link-775){.nounder}. Here again we are
reminded of a Viconean text: "The poetic characters, in which the
essence of the fables consists, were born of the need of a nature
incapable of abstracting[]{#calibre_link-4638} forms and properties from
subjects. Consequently they must have been the manner of thinking of
entire peoples, who had been placed under this natural necessity in the
times of their greatest barbarism. It is an eternal property of the
fables always to magnify the ideas of particulars. On this there is a
fine passage in Aristotle's *Ethics* in which he remarks that men of
limited ideas erect every[]{#calibre_link-4639} particular into a maxim.
The reason must be that the human mind, which is indefinite, being
constricted by the vigor of the senses, cannot otherwise express its
almost divine nature than by thus magnifying particulars in imagination.
It is perhaps on this account that in both the Greek and the Latin poets
the images of gods and heroes always appear larger than those of men,
and that in the returned[]{#calibre_link-4640} barbarian times the
paintings particularly of the Eternal Father, of Jesus Christ and of the
Virgin Mary are exceedingly large" (*Scienza Nuova*, 3, II: 18, tr.
Chaix-Ruy) \[p. 279\].

[]{#calibre_link-434}[8](#calibre_link-776){.nounder}. II.I, pp.
111---12 \[pp. 168, 171\]. This is also Warburton's procedure in the
remarkable paragraphs that he devotes to the "Origin and Progress of
Language" (I: 48 f.) \[pp. 81 f.\]. Thus: "In judging only from the
nature[]{#calibre_link-4641} of things, and without the surer aid of
revelation, one should be apt to embrace the opinion of Diodorus Siculus
(lib.ii) and Vitruvius (lib.ii, cap.I) that the first men lived for some
time in woods and caves, after the manner of beasts, uttering only
confused and indistinct sounds, till, associating for mutual assistance,
they came, by degrees, to use such as were articulate, for the
arbitrary[]{#calibre_link-4642} signs or marks, mutually agreed on, of
those ideas in the mind of the speaker, which he wanted to communicate
to others. Hence the diversity of languages; for it is agreed on all
hands that speech is not innate." And yet, "nothing being more evident
from scripture, than that language had a different original. God, we
there find, taught the first man religion; and can we think he would
not, at[]{#calibre_link-4643} the same time, teach him language?"
\[Condillac, p. 170\].

[]{#calibre_link-435}[9](#calibre_link-777){.nounder}. II.I. 2, 3, p.
113 \[pp. 172--73\]. We have italicized only "frightened" and
"mimicked." The same examples are reconsidered in the chapter on "The
Origin of Poetry:" "For example, in the mode of speaking by action, to
give an idea of a person that had been frightened, they had no other way
than to mimic the cries and natural signs of fear"[]{#calibre_link-4644}
(\$ 66, p. 148) \[pp. 227--28\].

[]{#calibre_link-436}[10](#calibre_link-778){.nounder}. "Every object at
first received a particular name without regard to genus or species,
which these primitive originators were not in a position to distinguish;
... so that, the, narrower the limits of their knowledge of things, the
more copious their dictionary must have been. ... Add to this, that
general ideas cannot be introduced into the mind without the
assistance[]{#calibre_link-4645} of words, nor can the understanding
seize them except by means of propositions. This is one of the reasons
why animals cannot form such ideas or ever acquire that capacity for
self-improvement *\[perfectibilité\]* which depends on them. ... We must
then make use of \[ ...\] language *\[parler\]* in order to form general
ideas. For no sooner does the imagination cease to operate than the
understanding proceeds[]{#calibre_link-4646} only by the help of words.
If then the first inventors of speech could give names only to ideas
they already had, it follows that the first substantives could be
nothing more than proper names" (pp. 149--50. See also the editor's
notes) \[pp. 177--78\].

Warburton (I: 5) \[p. 67\] which take into account what Condillac does
not---the "mutual influences" which speech and writing exercise upon
each other. "To explain this mutual Influence in the Manner it deserves,
would require a just Volume" (p. 202) *\[Warburton*, p. 150\]. (On the
impossibility of a purely figurative script, cf. Duclos
op.[]{#calibre_link-4648} cit., p. 421.)

replies---"Yes and no." (p. 30).

[]{#calibre_link-442}[16](#calibre_link-784){.nounder}. As for this
monogeneticism and the economic rationality of this genealogy,
Condillac's prudence has limits, although the *Traité des
systèms*[]{#calibre_link-4649} (1749) is careful enough (Chap. 17): "If
all the characters in use since the origin of history could have come
down to us with a key which would explain them, we would disentangle
this progress in a sensible manner. With those that are extant, however,
we can develop this system, if not in all its detail, at least
sufficiently so as to assure us of the generation of the different types
of script.[]{#calibre_link-4650} M. Warburton's work is a proof of this"
(Cf. *DE*, p. 101).

[]{#calibre_link-444}[18](#calibre_link-786){.nounder}. On these
questions and their subsequent development, I take the liberty of
referring once again[]{#calibre_link-4651} to *Speech and Phenomena*
(op. cit.).

[]{#calibre_link-446}[19](#calibre_link-787){.nounder}. This final
reappropriation of presence is most often named by Rousseau as an
anthropological telos: "Let man appropriate everything to himself; but
what is important for him to appropriate is man himself" (Manuscript of
*Emile*). But as usual this anthropologism essentially comes to terms
with a theology.

[]{#calibre_link-447}[20](#calibre_link-788){.nounder}. Other examples
of the mistrust that everything[]{#calibre_link-4652} operating through
writing in social and political life inspired in Rousseau:---In Venice:
"Here one is dealing with an invisible government and always in writing,
which requires great circumspection." 2. ---"In popular estimation the
Platonic Institution stands for all that is fanciful and unreal. For my
own [part I](#calibre_link-141){.nounder} should have thought the system
of Lycurgus far more fanciful \[chimérique\] had he
merely[]{#calibre_link-4653} committed it to writing" (*Emile*, p. 10)
\[p. 8\] J. de Maistre will say: "What is most essential is never
written down and can in fact not be written down without exposing the
state."

[]{#calibre_link-448}[21](#calibre_link-789){.nounder}. This is the
reason why Rousseau admits the necessity of representation even while
deploring it. See the *Considérations sur le gouvernement de Pologne
\[The Government of Poland*, tr. Willmoore Kendall (New
York,[]{#calibre_link-4654} 1972)\]; there he proposes a very rapid
turnover of representatives in order to make their "seduction more
costly and more difficult," which is to be related to the rule
formulated by the *Contract*, according to which "often should the
Sovereign show himself" (p. 426) \[p. 75\]; cf. also Derathé, *Rousseau
et la science politique de son temps* (pp. 277 f.).

What logic does Rousseau obey when he thus[]{#calibre_link-4655}
justifies the necessity of a representation that he simultaneously
condemns? Precisely the logic of representation; the more it aggravates
its disease, the more representative it becomes, representation restores
what it takes away: the presence of the represented. A logic according
to which one must force oneself "to draw from the disease itself its own
remedy" (Fragment on *L'état de nature*, p.[]{#calibre_link-4656} 479)
and according to which, at the end of its movement, convention rejoins
Nature, servitude liberty, etc. ("What then? Is liberty maintained only
by the help of slavery? It may be so. Extremes meet." *The Social
Contract*, p. 431 \[p. 79\]).

[]{#calibre_link-450}[22](#calibre_link-790){.nounder}. *De l'état de
nature, \[Pléiade*, vol. 3\], p. 478. Cf. also, *Emile*, p. 70 \[p.
49\].

[]{#calibre_link-451}[23](#calibre_link-791){.nounder}. On the rebus,
cf. supra, p. 136 \[p. 90\]. Vico who also
distinguishes[]{#calibre_link-4657} among three conditions or steps of
writing, gives as one example, among others, of primitive writing
(ideographic or hieroglyphic, "born spontaneously" and "not drawing its
origins from conventions at all") the "rebus of Picardy" \[p. 128\].
"The second form of script is equally and completely spontaneous: it is
a symbolic or emblematically heroic script" (coats of arms, blazonry,
"mute comparisons[]{#calibre_link-4658} which Homer calls *sernata*, the
signs in []{#calibre_link-874}which the heroes wrote" \[p. 129\]). "The
third form of writing: alphabetic script" (*Science nouvelle*, 3, 1, pp.
61--62, 181--82, 194, tr. Chaix-Ruy).

[]{#calibre_link-452}[24](#calibre_link-792){.nounder}. This is Duclos's
thesis: "Writing (I speak of the writing of sounds) was not born like
language through a slow and imperceptible progression: many centuries
passed before it was born; but it was born all[]{#calibre_link-4659} at
once, like light." After having retraced the history of pre-alphabetic
scripts, Duclos appeals to that "stroke of genius" among languages:
"Such is Chinese writing today, corresponding to ideas rather than to
sounds; such are with us the signs of algebra and Arabic numerals.
Writing was in that condition, with no relationship with today's
writing, when a happy and profound genius sensed that
discourse,[]{#calibre_link-4660} however varied and extended in terms of
ideas, is yet composed of only a few sounds, and the point was merely to
give each of the latter a representative character. If one reflects upon
this, one will see that this art, once conceived, must have been formed
almost simultaneously; and it is this that exalts the glory of the
inventor. ... It was much easier to count all the sounds of a
language,[]{#calibre_link-4661} than to discover that they could be
counted. One was a stroke of genius, the other a simple result of
attention" (op. cit., pp. 421--23).

[]{#calibre_link-453}[25](#calibre_link-793){.nounder}. *Emile*, p. 218
\[pp. 152--53\]. There Rousseau presents a theory of the origin of
money, its necessity, and its danger.

[]{#calibre_link-454}[26](#calibre_link-794){.nounder}. Ibid. In the
*Fragments politiques* also, one will read: "Gold and silver, being
nothing more than representative signs of the
material[]{#calibre_link-4662} for which they have been exchanged, have
properly speaking no absolute value." "Since money has no real value by
itself, it takes a value by tacit convention in every country where it
is in use ..." (p. 520) and in the *Government of Poland:* "Money, in
the last analysis, is not wealth, but merely the sign for wealth; and
what you must multiply is not the sign but rather the represented thing"
(p.[]{#calibre_link-4663} 1008) \[p. 73\]. It is precisely at the
opening of Chapter 15 on "Deputies or Representatives" that *The Social
Contract* (Bk. III) condemns money as the power of servitude: "Make
gifts of money, you will not be long without chains" \[p. 77\].

transparence"* to a *"world of opacity."*

[]{#calibre_link-460}[31](#calibre_link-799){.nounder}. It is well-known
that Rousseau ruthlessly[]{#calibre_link-4665} denounced the mask, from
the *Letter to M. d' Alembert* to the *Nouvelle Héloise*. One of the
tasks of pedagogy consists precisely in neutralizing the effects of
masks upon children. For let us not forget, "all children are afraid of
masks" (*Emile*, p. 43) \[p. 30\]. The condemnation of writing is also,
as if self-evidently, an ambiguous condemnation of the mask.

[]{#calibre_link-461}[32](#calibre_link-800){.nounder}. Among other
analogies, by this distrust,[]{#calibre_link-4666} with regard to the
spoken text, of Corneille and Racine who were nothing but "talkers" even
though, "imitating the English," they must sometimes "place the stage
itself within representation" (*La Nouvelle Héloise*, p. 253) *\[Eloisa*
II., p. 62\]. But surely these reconciliations must be effected with the
greatest caution. The context sometimes places an infinite distance
between two identical propositions.

[]{#calibre_link-465}[35](#calibre_link-804){.nounder}. Rousseau dreams
of an unarticulated language, but he describes the origin of languages
as the passage from the cry to articualtion. The[]{#calibre_link-4668}
consonant which for him goes hand in hand with articulation, is the
becoming-language of sound, the becomingphonetic of natural sonority. It
is the consonant that gives the possibility of a linguistic pertinence
to sound, by inscribing it within an opposition. Jakobson has shown,
against current prejudices, that "in the acquisition of language, the
first vocalic opposition is []{#calibre_link-4669}posterior to
the[]{#calibre_link-4670} first consonantal oppositions; there is thus a
stage when the consonants already fulfill a distinctive function,
whereas the unique vowel yet serves only as stress to the consonant and
as material for expressive variations. Thus we see the consonants
acquiring phonemic value before vowels" ("Les lois phoniques du langage
enfantin et leur place dans la phonologie générale," *Selected Writings*
\[The[]{#calibre_link-4671} Hague, 1962\], I: 325).

Speech is to give the sign of one's thought with an articulated voice.
Writing is to do it with permanent characters on paper. The latter need
not be referred back to the voice, as is obvious from the characters of
the Chinese script.

*"Pucelage"* is the more earthy French word for the actual physical fact
of sexual intactness, in the female the membrane itself. Rousseau
applies the word to his own case with some derision, contrasting it to
the spiritual innocence of true "virginity."
