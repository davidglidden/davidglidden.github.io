## []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xiii}INTRODUCTION {.fm-head}

</div>

The *West-Eastern Divan* is in many ways a revolutionary book. Goethe himself was no revolutionary -- far from it -- and yet his book had the effect of capsizing conventional nineteenth-century conceptions of poetry. It represented nothing less than a decisive reconfiguration of German, and indeed European, poetry. Goethe achieved this in the most unexpected way: by his openness to a foreign and exotic world that was unknown to his readers, he widened the scope of German poetry and he did so in formal measures that were thoroughly familiar, thoroughly German and yet, startlingly new, even bizarre, in their content. He taught his readers to decipher 'that hidden grammar that declines both the poppy and the rose' ('Higher and Highest', Poem 188).^[1](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_1){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn1}^ He introduced a new lexicon of tropes and figures drawn from Persian poetry, as well as a novel form of allusiveness. He wrote, 'The word is a fan! Between its pleats a pair of lovely eyes gazes out' ('Hint', Poem 26) and the poems themselves are 'pleated': Persian or Arabic sources, ingeniously adapted from prose or verse excerpts in translation, are shaped into fresh and original forms ('The Winter and Timur', Poem 102).^[2](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_2){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn2}^ When Goethe writes, 'The rose always appears impossible, inconceivable the nightingale' (Poem 109), he is folding a line from Rūmī into German and the effect is at once mysterious and familiar; it is an insight that opens ever outward and yet, it is one we seem always to have had. The genial tone of the book only enhances its strangeness.

Readers new to the *Divan* might expect to find further []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xiv}evidence of the 'Olympian' Goethe, that lofty and rather stuffy caricature. After all, he was almost seventy when he embarked on the *Divan*. And yet, though the poems are those of an ageing man, they read as if written by a young man. Even the stateliest poems in the *Divan* display an ardour and passion that are hardly consistent with the image of 'Goethe the Sage', the very effigy of wisdom mounted on a pompous pedestal. We know, of course, that this is a false image; Goethe once confessed that he had not passed a day of his life without experiencing severe inner conflict. What serenity he possessed came at the cost of continual effort. This is not immediately apparent in the *Divan* for it is a book of uncommon radiance; and yet, when we consider the contradictions and antitheses on which it is based and from which it arose, we may glimpse something of the spiritual and artistic struggle it demanded. Then, too, for all their formal beauty the poems of the *Divan* are often impetuous and sometimes even a bit silly; they present the unlikely spectacle of an old man besotted with a younger woman -- and a younger married woman at that. This is the stuff of comedy; and in certain poems, there are hints that Goethe was aware of the absurdity of his situation, if only in the eyes of envious others. That he succeeded in transforming this potentially comical affair (for the husband was not simply complacent but flattered to be cuckolded by the great Goethe!) into sublime verse testifies not only to the shaping force of his imagination but to something even rarer: the capacity to surrender with complete confidence to his own deepest feelings and to follow wherever they might lead him.

### [WHAT IS A '*DIVAN*'?]{.small} {.h3}

By 1814, five years before the publication of the *Divan*, Goethe had come upon the poems of Ḥāfiẓ in the translation of Joseph von Hammer (later von Hammer-Purgstall), a []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xv}prolific Orientalist who had rendered the complete *Divan* of the Persian poet into German. The word *divan* (*dīwān* in Arabic) is itself of Persian origin; originally it meant a kind of register, a record. (The word has passed into European languages to designate border and customs controls, e.g., *douane* in French or *dogana* in Italian.) An early Arab philologist could state that 'poetry is the *dīwān* of the Arabs'. By that he meant that the poems of the pre-Islamic Arabs, with their very specific mentions of places and of tribes, of battles and skirmishes, of blood-feuds and clan rivalries, served as a record of events that would otherwise have been lost. That poetry was oral and carried in the memories both of poets and of professional reciters, some of whom knew thousands of poems and lines by heart and declaimed them, often on the eve of battle, to encourage their own troops and intimidate their enemies. (Goethe gives one example of such a poem in the beginning of his *Notes and Essays.*)^[3](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_3){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn3}^ But the word *divan* also came to designate the collected works of a poet. And it is in conscious imitation of his beloved Ḥāfiẓ that Goethe chose to use the word *Divan* for his own collection. Even so, there is a crucial distinction to be noted. Goethe calls his own collection the *West-östlicher Divan*, the *West-Eastern Divan*. His *Divan* is not to be simply an imitation of an Eastern model but a work that holds both East and West in firm but affectionate equipoise.

### [THE THEMES OF THE *DIVAN*]{.small} {.h3}

The *Divan* can seem puzzling at first sight; a summary of its main themes may be useful. Goethe himself identifies four such themes in Poem 7 ('Elements'). These are, first and foremost, love 'above all things', then wine and wine-drinking, the 'clink of glasses', war, the 'clang of weapons', and finally, whatever is hateful. The last-mentioned theme, the subject of []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xvi}The Book of Ill-Humour, may surprise. The poems there do not deal with 'the hateful' as such but with certain specific moral flaws, such as arrogance and self-love; they complement the ethical precepts which Goethe was so fond of dispensing, often in aphoristic form (as in The Book of Wisdom), and they settle a few scores along the way (e.g., Poem 74 and 'Wanderer's Peace of Mind', Poem 76).

The eminent Goethe scholar Karl Otto Conrady has revised Goethe's summary of his themes. Conrady identifies four that are interwoven throughout, the first of which is 'the poetic art of Ḥāfiẓ which spurred Goethe on to a new, hitherto unexpected productivity'. He then lists love, culminating in the 'duo-drama' of Hatem and Suleika and thirdly, 'earthly and spiritual drunkenness' as seen in The Book of the Cup-Bearer. The last theme consists of 'The accumulated wisdom found in the edifying verses (*Spruchverse*).'^[4](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_4){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn4}^

This is a good corrective but it is incomplete. For there are at least two other powerful themes that course through the entire *Divan*. Perhaps the most significant of these is song itself. For Goethe, song is not only ancient but primordial; it has neither beginning nor end and so is virtually eternal ('Unbounded', Poem 23). It is no coincidence that the opening book of the *Divan* is entitled The Book of the Singer. And as Goethe makes clear ('Song and Shape', Poem 13), for him, song is something flowing and elemental, like the river Euphrates itself, water that the poet must seize and shape, unlike the rigid forms that a Greek artisan crafts out of clay. This too is something new in the poetry of the time.

The other theme is that of longing. It is longing that 'holds us all, from the dust-speck to the throne, in mighty bonds' ('To Hafiz', Poem 27).^[5](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_5){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn5}^ The sense of longing, of yearning (*Sehn-sucht*) []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xvii}that permeates the *Divan*, though not always explicitly stated, may be what makes the book still so fresh, so youthful, after two hundred years. There is no finality to the Poet's quest; there is only further transformation. And it is longing that impels transformation. This is most evident in 'Holy Longing' (*Selige Sehnsucht*, Poem 17), one of the most famous and perhaps the most beautiful of Goethe's later poems.

It is possible to read this poem as an epitome of Islamic mysticism. From the opening injunction to keep privileged knowledge from the uninitiated, a fundamental Sufi notion, to the final imperative 'Die and become!', corresponding to the paired notions of 'self-annihilation' (*fanā'*) and 'abiding return' (*baqā'*) of the classical Sufi manuals^[6](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_6){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn6}^ -- not forgetting the pervasive trope of the moth and the flame in Persian poetry -- the poem seems wholly inspired by a Sufi vision of personal transformation. And yet, the matter is not so straightforward. Thus, the moth of Persian poetry has now become a butterfly, an ancient Greek symbol of the soul (*psyche*). The concern to keep esoteric knowledge from the uninitiated is at least as old as Horace^[7](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_7){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn7}^ and figured in the ancient mystery religions as well as in Christianity. The commandment to 'die and become' is found in many variants in the New Testament.^[8](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_8){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn8}^

The conceptual beauty of the poem lies in the deft assimilation of concepts drawn from antiquity, Christian teaching and Islamic mysticism; these elements are subtly intertwined and none is privileged above the others. It is an example of the kind of 'doubling' (about which more below) that characterises the *Divan* from beginning to end.

### []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xviii}[LOVE IN THE *DIVAN*]{.small} {.h3}

If love forms the dominant subject of the *Divan*, it is, as we might expect, a complicated kind of love, at once intimate and theatrical, spontaneous and yet scripted. Though Goethe's passion and desire for Marianne von Willemer, the Suleika of the *Divan*, were authentic enough, as the poems he wrote to her -- and she to him -- make plain, there was also something structured about the course of the affair. Genuine love and a tacit form of artifice were both in play. For poetic, if not romantic, reasons, the affair had to follow a certain pattern. The final separation, when it occurred, was wrenching but inevitable; and this, not because Marianne or Goethe wished it so but at least in part because 'separation' forms one of the classical tropes in Arabic and Persian -- as well as, of course, European -- poetry. Had there been union without any ultimate separation, the *Divan* could not have been faithful to its model, nor to life. There is thus even in Goethe's genuine ardour, as in Marianne's, an element of self-consciousness, of calculation. This does not weaken or impair the love poems; on the contrary, it gives drama and momentum to The Book of Suleika, arguably the high point of the *Divan*. The element of conscious artifice in the *Divan* leads us to consider other elements in this strange and unprecedented collection.

### [THE DOUBLENESS OF THE *DIVAN*]{.small} {.h3}

It is important to keep Goethe's balance of elements, of his chosen themes and disparate voices, in mind when reading the *Divan*. Much of the energy, and the occasional tension, of the poems arises from this juxtaposition. However much Goethe fell under the spell of Ḥāfiẓ, whom he considered his 'twin', he always remained stubbornly himself, resolutely German, and proclaimed himself as such. He is at once Ḥāfiẓ []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xix}and not-Ḥāfiẓ, just as Marianne remains resolutely herself even as she is transformed into Suleika. This doubleness creates much of the charm of the *Divan* but it is more than just a poetical or rhetorical device. The very conception of the *Divan* impels this doubling since its overriding objective is to hold both East and West in balance; neither is predominant: they are separate and yet unified like the twin lobes of the gingko leaf.

This double identity lies at the heart of the book, as it lay at the heart of Goethe himself, as man and poet. The most celebrated poem in the *Divan* expresses this with the utmost simplicity -- a simplicity that only intensifies the enigma. The poem is 'Gingko Biloba' (Poem 113), a poem known to every speaker of German. (Gingko, the publisher of this book, takes its name in tribute to this poem.)

### *Gingko Biloba* {.h3}

::: top
The leaf of this tree, that from the East has been entrusted to my garden, gives a secret meaning to savour as it gladdens those who know.
:::

Is it One living being that divides itself within itself? Is it two that have chosen each other so as to be seen as One?

::: top
To answer such questions I have discovered the correct sense: do you not feel that in my songs I am both double and One?
:::

Goethe sent this poem to Marianne written out in his own hand, with a gingko leaf pasted to the page; it was, in one sense, a symbol of the union between himself and Marianne. In a deeper sense, however, it was a profound self-disclosure. The leaf of the gingko has two lobes that appear distinct []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xx}and yet, they form a single leaf. Is it two in one? Or is it one leaf with two contiguous segments? It is an 'eastern' leaf transplanted to a 'western' garden. It is, like the poet himself, both double and one. In *Faust* I, the protagonist declares that 'Two souls dwell, alas, within my breast!' (*Zwei Seelen wohnen, ach! in meiner Brust!*)^[9](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_9){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn9}^ But Faust's dividedness appears simpler than Goethe's, as expressed in '*Gingo biloba'*. For Faust is torn between his nobler and his baser instincts, as we all are, while Goethe is expressing his fundamental nature; his doubleness is intrinsic to what he is. This is not the expression of 'a divided self', as with Faust; nor is it an anguished outcry. It is presented as a simple fact: this is who in essence I am. The oneness and the doubleness are simultaneously present; they represent a form of riddling hypostasis. And this doubleness-in-one, this sundered yet seamless identity, provides an essential clue to the *Divan* and its mysteries.

There are pairings and doublings throughout the work. There is, first of all, the twinship of Goethe and Ḥāfiẓ, both of whom are distinct and yet harmonised in Goethe's lyrical voice. There is Goethe and Suleika, Marianne's double, the lovers who are discrete individuals united, however briefly, in passion and then remembrance. There is Goethe and Hatem, his poetic alter ego. Other elements are brought into conjunction: the contrast -- and conflict -- between Islam and Christianity, between Islam and Zoroastrianism; the struggle between skepticism and belief, between simple piety, such as Goethe had inherited from his ancestors, and Voltairean scorn. Even scriptures are subject to this divergence: the Qur'ān of Ḥāfiẓ and the Bible of Goethe; he was, as he put it, *bibelfest*, thoroughly versed in the Bible, from his childhood, while Ḥāfiẓ could proclaim: 'Through the Qur'an have I done/ Everything which has come to me.'^[10](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_10){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn10}^ And there is too the more intimate doubling, between Goethe, the confident []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxi}master in his own domain, and Goethe, the lone individual beset by night-terrors ('False Comfort', Poem 36).

### [THE DIVAN: A BOOK OF VOICES]{.small} {.h3}

The *Divan* is also a book of individual voices; it is a polyphonic work. 'The Poet' (*der Dichter*: a persona of Goethe himself) has the predominant voice, by turns exuberant, ironic, ecstatic and earthy. But the Poet does not speak in isolation: he converses with, questions, confides in and sometimes harangues his interlocutors. He addresses Ḥāfiẓ (and other poets) directly, and Ḥāfiẓ replies. The poems to and from Suleika, in The Book of Suleika, form an impassioned love duet in which each of the two speakers engages the other. In the ninth book there are extended exchanges between the Poet and the Cup-Bearer who displays his own particular accents, now tender and affectionate, now chiding and consoling. In The Book of Paradise the Poet converses with the *houris*, those celestial consorts in the Muslim paradise; the repartee is flirtatious, playful and gently humorous. In the *Divan*, even the winter speaks and its voice is ferocious as it challenges the Mongol conqueror Timur ('The Winter and Timur', Poem 102). The dialogues in the *Divan* represent one aspect of its central theme: the enduring presence, indeed the immortality, of song itself that has neither beginning nor end ('Unbounded', Poem 23). In this light many of the poems may be read as little recitatives or arias, momentary solos and duets. As Goethe was well aware, poetry in the Muslim world was meant not merely to be recited or declaimed but sung; Goethe acknowledges this fact in the very first poem of the first book when he evokes the mule-driver who sings the poems of Ḥāfiẓ as he rides. It is significant in this regard that the major anthology of classical Arabic poetry, compiled by Abū al-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī (897--967) in the tenth century, is entitled 'The Book of Songs' (*Kitāb al-Aghānī*). Given the []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxii}privileged place of song in the *Divan*, it is hardly surprising that many of its lyrics have been set to music.^[11](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_11){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn11}^

But who are the singers of these songs?

### [ḤĀFIẒ]{.small} {.h3}

The dominant presence throughout the *Divan --* leaving aside the Poet himself *--* is that of the Persian poet Ḥāfiẓ. Goethe addresses him ('To Ḥāfiẓ', Poem 27 and 'Notes and Essays', pp. 383--5), interrogates him ('Pen-Name', Poem 18), extols him ('Imitation', Poem 24) and alludes to him repeatedly. He identifies with him too, especially when confronting those he considers narrow-minded and hypocritical ('Open Secret', Poem 25). For Goethe, Ḥāfiẓ is a sublimely free spirit, and never more so than when he is praising wine or love.

Ḥāfiẓ, by his full name Khwāja Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfiẓ-i Shīrāzī,^[12](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_12){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn12}^ was born in Shiraz sometime around 1325 and died there in 1390. He memorised the entire Qur'ān as a child, hence his chosen poetic pen-name of Ḥāfiẓ, i.e., someone who knows the scripture by heart. He is considered by Persians to be the supreme master of the *ghazal* (on which, see below); however, his *Divan*, assembled by his followers after his death, is controversial even if no one disputes its beauty. Controversy arose during his lifetime because of his often shocking and indeed, sacrilegious sentiments. Thus, he praises wine and wine-drinking with unabashed exuberance. He advises his readers to 'dye the prayer-mat with wine'. He depicts the holy angels banging on the tavern door to get a drink. He lavishes praise on 'the Magian sage' (*pīr-i Mughān*), a representative of Zoroastrianism, a religion condemned as []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxiii}dualistic and so heretical in orthodox eyes; worse, the sage is a tavern-keeper to boot! Moreover, Ḥāfiẓ's love poems are sensual and erotic and dwell on the physical attributes of the beloved, his curls or the mole on his cheek or his musky scent.^[13](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_13){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn13}^

When Goethe first encountered the poems of Ḥāfiẓ, in 1814, in the German translations of Joseph von Hammer, he was gripped with excitement and admiration. Ḥāfiẓ became one of the chief catalysts of the *Divan*. This was not, however, Goethe's first encounter with the 'East'. He had been immersed in Orientalist studies for some two decades by then. He had read early Arabic poetry, in the translations of William Jones and others, and had cultivated a passionate interest in the pre-Islamic odes known as the *Mu῾allaqāt*, the 'suspended odes'^[14](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_14){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn14}^ (which he wanted to translate himself) and the poems of Mutanabbī, the tenth-century poet often considered the greatest of Arab poets (sometimes dubbed 'the Shakespeare of the Arabs'). He had studied and corresponded with leading scholars, had pored over numerous translations as they appeared, and had read intensively in travel accounts in German, English, Italian and French -- all acknowledged in the conclusion of his 'Notes and Essays' (see pp. 481--96, 507--9). He revered such scholars as Jones, von Hammer or Diez or the great French Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy, even if he was not always uncritical of them; thus, he admired Joseph von Hammer for his erudition but was contemptuous of his attempts at poetry -- a fact that stung von Hammer. And though Goethe never learned Arabic or Persian or Turkish beyond an elementary level, he did learn to read and write Arabic script and was a competent, if []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxiv}clumsy, calligrapher.^[15](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_15){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn15}^ Even so, setting aside his ignorance of the languages, Goethe could be considered virtually a professional Orientalist by the time he encountered the poems of Ḥāfiẓ.^[16](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_16){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn16}^

What so fascinated Goethe in the work of Ḥāfiẓ?

First, the recurrent themes of the *ghazals*: love and wine and the sheer exuberance and untrammelled enjoyment the Persian poet took in both of these. Second, there were the biting and often savage asides on smug and hypocritical clergy that feature so prominently in Ḥāfiẓ's work. The poems were at one and the same time tender and caustic. Ḥāfiẓ's scornful dismissal of 'those who hug the shore' (*sabukbārān-i sāḥel-hā*) as opposed to those who face 'the dark night, the terror of the waves and the whirlpool', as Ḥāfiẓ put it in the first *ghazal* of his *Divan*, could not but appeal to Goethe's adventurous spirit. The provocative and even outrageous sentiments of the *ghazal*s proved irresistible, so much so that Goethe came, rather bizarrely, to regard Ḥāfiẓ as a 'Persian Voltaire'. Goethe's view is far-fetched, to say the least. Whether Ḥāfiẓ expressed dissident sentiments because he actually held them or whether he used such statements to shatter conventional pieties is still an open question; certainly, Sufis had used scandalous remarks and shocking paradoxes for centuries to startle unthinking believers out of rote worship and blind conformity. For example, the Persian Sufi Aḥmad al-Ghazālī, almost three centuries before Ḥāfiẓ, []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxv}had gone so far as to claim that Satan was the only true monotheist (since he refused to bow down before Adam when God commanded him); Satan, he further said, was God's most devoted lover. Still, this does not seem to be, on the face of it, what Ḥāfiẓ intended; there is something too personal, too cutting, in his utterances to be meant as merely edifying.

This is a vexed question for students of Ḥāfiẓ, and it continues to vex, with certain scholars arguing that Ḥāfiẓ meant what he said and others insisting that he wrote in a carefully coded manner:^[17](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_17){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn17}^ for example, wine was to be understood not as the abhorrent, and forbidden, intoxicant but as something purely symbolic; so too the grape itself, the vine, the goblet. For certain commentators, such as the 16th-century Ottoman translator Aḥmed Sūdī, Ḥāfiẓ's poems were to be interpreted figuratively; they were intricate expressions of Sufi mysticism so that wine symbolises 'the love of God', among other things.^[18](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_18){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn18}^

Whatever the truth of this, Goethe had no doubt that Ḥāfiẓ meant what he said and that he was an enthusiastic champion of wine and wine-drinking. In one poem, which he excluded from the *Divan*, he invites Ḥāfiẓ to partake of the []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxvi}wine known as Eilfer, and specifically the celebrated 1811 vintage (Appendix, poems 212 and 213).

### [SULEIKA]{.small} {.h3}

Goethe gave the name 'Suleika' to Marianne von Willemer (1784--1860) whom he met and fell in love with in 1814. She, along with Ḥāfiẓ, inspired the writing of the *Divan*; the first poems were written in that year under this dual inspiration. An Austrian actress and dancer, Marianne became the third wife of the Frankfurt banker Johann Jakob von Willemer, an admirer of Goethe, who in fact introduced them. Marianne, as Suleika, is central to the *Divan* and the eighth book, which is dedicated to her, forms the heart of the work. Goethe's poems to her are among the most beautiful and moving of his love poems. But Marianne was no merely passive recipient of Goethe's passion. She responded to him completely, as is shown by the fact that she wrote at least five of the poems which Goethe included (without attribution to her) in the eighth book.^[19](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_19){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn19}^ Moreover, Marianne was no shrinking violet: she knew that her poems were good. After she had acknowledged her authorship, years after Goethe's death, to the young Herman Grimm, she noted that Goethe had revised two stanzas of her Poem 135 and then remarked, 'I find my own really more beautiful.' ^[20](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_20){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn20}^

Certain poems in The Book of Suleika are written in what has become known as the 'Suleika-strophes' (*Suleika-Strophen*) because of her use of them in her own poems. These are quatrains written in trochaic tetrameter with alternating rhyme (a-b, a-b, c-d, c-d, etc.). Marianne's poems fit so seamlessly into the *Divan* that a casual reader would not realise that they are by a hand other than Goethe's; and yet, []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxvii}they are not merely echoes of Goethe, they have their own inimitable accents. Perhaps this is why Goethe incorporated them into the *Divan*: they harmonise with his poems while possessing a real woman's recognisable voice. (At the same time, it has to be said, it was ungenerous of Goethe not to give Marianne the credit she was due. For at least one critic (Max Rychner) they are the first great poems in German by a woman poet.)

Goethe conferred the name Suleika on Marianne. This was his variant on the Arabic or Persian name Zulaykhā (![image](images/pg27.jpg){.mid}), meaning 'brilliant' or 'beautiful'. In the Islamic tradition this was the name given to the wife of Potiphar who tries, to her own undoing, to seduce Joseph in the Qur'ān (sūra 12), though in the Qur'ān she is not named. By a strange transformation, no doubt under Sufi influence, Zulaykhā became a paragon of chastity and the love of God while Joseph, after his initial rejection, came to lust after her. Not surprisingly, Goethe does not accept this version (Poem 105), though he pairs the lovers with other famous couples ('Exemplary Images', Poem 28). And he gives himself a poetic pen-name, not Joseph but Hatem. This is an allusion to the pre-Islamic poet Ḥātim al-Ṭa'ī, a figure praised for his legendary generosity. Goethe's use of this pen-name gave rise to one of the most famous flourishes of the *Divan*. In Poem 123, the third stanza uses the rhyme *Morgenröthe* ('dawn') in the first line but in the third line, where the rhyme is expected, he writes *Hatem*; to complete the rhyme the reader must supply 'Goethe'. This is at once an affirmation of his doubleness of identity and a secret way of 'signing' the poem.^[21](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_21){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn21}^

### [[]{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxviii}THE CUP-BEARER]{.small} {.h3}

The fourth important voice in the *Divan* is that of the cup-bearer (*sāqī* in Arabic and Persian), the subject of the ninth book. For this stock-figure of both Arabic and Persian poetry, Goethe crafted a special voice, at once tender and deferential, intimate and yet assertive. The cup-bearer serves the poet with unfailing alacrity; he gently scolds him when he drinks too much. He sits up with him at night on the terrace when the poet is sleepless. In this figure Goethe managed to combine the ephebe of antiquity, such as Ganymede, with the discreetly hovering, solicitous and alluring cup-bearer of the Islamic poetic tradition. The cup-bearer, however, is not simply a servant; he is also a disciple and he hangs on the poet's words; he is eager for instruction. In Persian poetry, there was often too an intense erotic element: the cup-bearer is beautiful, his curls allure, he has a scent of musk, the down of manhood has just begun to show on his cheeks. Among certain Sufis, the practice of 'gazing on the beardless (boy)' was common, with the rationale that so to gaze was to glimpse the beauty of God. The practice was roundly condemned by critics of such Sufis.^[22](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_22){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn22}^ There is, it must be said, no trace of this in The Book of the Cup-Bearer. Rather, following on the love-duet of The Book of Suleika, it represents another form of love, that between young and old, teacher and student, master and disciple. Though Suleika reappears, though difficult and sometimes thorny theological subjects, such as the eternity of the Qur'ān, are introduced, it is a gentle book, perhaps the tenderest in the entire *Divan*.

### [[]{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxix}POETIC FORM IN THE *DIVAN*]{.small} {.h3}

The *Divan* demonstrates a continual, almost flickering tension between Goethe's chosen poetic forms and the forms of his models. Goethe favours traditional European metres, especially iambic tetrameter or pentameter; he regularly employs trochaic measures for more solemn effect. This stands in stark contrast to the prosody of the Arabs and Persians. With the Arabs, whose verse, like that of ancient Greek, was quantitative, with the alternation of long and short vowels enhancing the incantatory effect of the verse, and more than a dozen metres, with their variants, to choose from, there was simply no possibility of imitation. The case for Persian was even more problematic; the sheer variety of Persian prosody, with seemingly inexhaustible metrical forms in bewildering variants, made it inimitable in German.^[23](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_23){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn23}^ Goethe does not attempt to imitate or even suggest this intricate prosody; he may have been unaware of its distinctive features. (It is not clear whether Goethe ever heard Persian or Arabic poetry recited or sung.)

In the realm of rhyme, both Arabic and Persian classical poetry had a predilection for monorhyme, sometimes extending over a hundred or more lines. Even shorter forms, such as the *ghazal*, which Persian poets brought to dazzling perfection, depend upon monorhyme; this is not only difficult to imitate or to reproduce in German or English but the effect it produces in those languages tends to be thudding and monotonous.

This prompts an interesting question. Goethe, despite his reverence and admiration for Ḥāfiẓ, the supreme master of the *ghazal*, does not compose *ghazals* in the *West-Eastern Divan*.

True, he includes a number of poems with *ghazal*-like elements, particularly the recurrent single rhyme (see, for []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxx}example, Poems 51, 107, 147 and 158, among others) but the results, though often beautiful, seem half-hearted; the poems have some of the trappings of *ghazals* but are not true *ghazals*.

### [THE *GHAZAL*]{.small} {.h3}

The *ghazal* is a brief poem usually of no more than a dozen lines. It uses a single rhyme throughout, with somewhat the effect of a refrain. In the Persian *ghazal* the poet addresses himself in the last lines by his poetic pen-name (a device known as the *takhalluṣ*). The *ghazal* is almost always a love lyric and as such, it has a long history. Originally composed by Arab poets, especially in the Umayyad period, it often had a light and jaunty tone, especially in the poems of such early masters as the Meccan-born poet ‛Umar ibn abī Rabī‛a (died c. 712) who boasts in one poem, for example, that the best place to meet girls is in the sacred precincts of the Ka‛ba.

As a form the *ghazal* seems to have developed from the more prestigious early ode known as the *qaṣīda*, the opening section of which featured what is called rather quaintly an 'amatory prelude' (*naṣīb* in Arabic) by some Western scholars. In this prelude the poet, usually accompanied by a few sidekicks, stops at a deserted campsite where he discovers the traces of a long-departed tribe, a tribe to which his lost beloved belonged. He is overcome by memories and bursts into tears; this 'weeping over the ruins' (the *aṭlāl*) is a standard trope. Goethe was well aware of the trope and indeed, invoked it (Poem 216, Appendix).^[24](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_24){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn24}^ It is thought that this prelude, usually of no more than a dozen lines, developed into the independent form of the *ghazal*.

Here is an example of a *naṣīb* from the most famous []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxxi}pre-Islamic ode, that of the sixth-century 'wandering king' Imru'l-Qays, a poem that virtually obsessed Goethe for years:

::: top
Rein in your mares and weep, for a love and a campsite

at the dune's twisted edge between al-Dakhul and

Haumal,

Toodih and al-Mikrat, whose traces haven't yet been

swept away

by the weavings of the southern and northerly winds,

and look at the doe droppings scattered like peppercorns

in the sandhollows and beds of gravel.

The morning

they bundled their belongings by the thorny acacia and

left

I felt as if I'd sunk my teeth into a gourd.

Holding their riding-beasts back, my companions said,

'Come, be patient, don't wallow in grief,'

while tears were my only solace, for is there anything

to lean on in this trackless halting-place?^[25](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_25){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn25}^
:::

Though Arab poets wrote many beautiful *ghazals*, the full refinement of the form occurred at the hands of Persian poets, beginning with the great Rūdakī (858--941) and culminating in the work of Ḥāfiẓ. It was they who exploited the various metres of Persian prosody, the echoing rhyme-scheme announced in the opening hemistich^[26](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_26){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn26}^ and then carried forward, and the signature, the *takhalluṣ*, at the close, and so gave it the form and tone that continues to this day, not only in Persian but in Urdu and Turkish.

Even if Goethe himself did not attempt the *ghazal* in his []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxxii}*Divan*, other German poets were not so hesitant. Heinrich Heine might mock the growing fashion for the form as an 'Orient-craze' (*Orientsucht*). Even so, the fine but now neglected German poet August Graf von Platen (1796--1835), a younger contemporary of Goethe (who admired his work), wrote two collections of *ghazals* in German (*Ghaselen* of 1821 and *Neue Ghaselen* of 1823), as well as a *Spiegel des Hafis* (Mirror of Ḥāfiẓ, 1822). And the indefatigable translator and poet Friedrich Rückert (1788--1866) -- remembered nowadays, rather unkindly, for meeting his death when his heavily laden bookshelves toppled and crushed him while he was reading an Ethiopic grammar -- also employed the form. But the most brilliant author of a *ghazal* in German must surely be the great Austrian poet and playwright Hugo von Hofmannsthal (1874--1929). His youthful lyric 'Ghasel' captures the form (apart from the obligatory signature) and all its melodious potential to lovely effect. It is a consummately Goethean poem, the *ghazal* Goethe himself might have written.^[27](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_27){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn27}^

In recent years American poets have taken to writing *ghazals*, though usually modelled only vaguely on the original form. Such *ghazals* are much looser than their Persian models, creating the impression of a sort of riff rather than of a formal poem with its own strict rules. By contrast, the Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali (1949--2001) wrote *ghazals* that respect the form while also conveying something of the saucy and salacious tone of many of the originals. Here in its entirety is his poem 'Tonight' which gives a good idea of a genuine *ghazal*:

[]{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxxiii}*Tonight*

:::

The poem is true not only to the formal aspects of the *ghazal* (the couplets, the monorhyme, the signature) but to the manner of many Persian *ghazals*: the snippets of dialogue, the quotations (such as the allusions to the Book of Job and *Moby Dick* at the conclusion), the dodgy expressions of belief or disbelief verging on blasphemy and perhaps chiefly, the distressed tone of voice that seems disconnected but is not; the unity of the poem is one of emotional coherence rather than of logical sequence.

Such aspects of the *ghazal* appealed to Goethe. He found an unexpected sense of freedom not so much in the form as in its tone and manner. He liked the effect of spontaneity; he liked the distinctive voice, its accents at once bantering and grave. He especially admired what he thought of as the sceptical cast of mind of Ḥāfiẓ, the 'Persian Voltaire'.

### [THE 'NOTES AND ESSAYS FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE *WEST-EASTERN DIVAN*']{.small} {.h3}

Though Goethe claimed that one must go to a poet's land to understand his poetry, he himself never travelled to the East; he travelled there purely in imagination, nourished by []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxxv}his reading and his exchanges with scholars. As the 'Notes and Essays' reveal, his reading was wide and various: not only translations but also scholarly monographs, historical works and travellers' accounts. While the 'Notes and Essays' do elucidate many aspects of the poems, they also, if only incidentally, give a good sense of Goethe's mental and imaginative world.

Goethe wrote the 'Notes and Essays' in 1819 under pressure of a deadline so that they might be included in the first edition of the *Divan*; he knew that most of his readers would need some help 'for a better understanding' of the poems because of the unfamiliar names and places mentioned, as well as of the figures and tropes common to Arabic and Persian poetry. The 'Notes and Essays', despite their some-what miscellaneous character -- he seems at times to be trying to squeeze in everything that he knows -- betray the same enthusiasm, the same passion, for the Orient as the poems themselves. The book is pretty much self-explanatory but one apparent anomaly deserves mention.

This is Goethe's inclusion of a long essay on the wanderings of the Israelites in the desert. The essay had been written some twenty-five years earlier, when he was engaged in biblical studies, and it seems both an afterthought and a digression in the context of the *Divan*. But it was not a jarring inclusion at the time. It has to be remembered that in Europe, and especially in Germany, the study of Hebrew and of the Bible was then closely allied with study of Arabic; both were related 'Semitic' languages; the study of one illumined the other. The standard grammar of Classical Arabic, even today, is William Wright's *A Grammar of the Arabic Language* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1859--62), in two volumes, itself a translation from the German. In his *Grammar*, Wright (1830--89) routinely illustrates his Arabic examples by reference to Hebrew (as well as Syriac and Ethiopic). The study of Arabic and Hebrew nowadays is sharply politicised; neither language would be offered in the same academic department. []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxxvi}But this was standard philological practice in Goethe's day and would not have raised an eyebrow.^[29](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_29){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn29}^

### [A REVOLUTIONARY BOOK?]{.small} {.h3}

I have claimed that the *Divan* was a 'revolutionary' book of poems. Its revolutionary nature, comparable to that of *Leaves of Grass* or *Les Fleurs du mal*, among nineteenth-century works of poetry, is evident in both subject matter and style.^[30](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_30){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn30}^ Goethe's enthusiastic embrace of various aspects of Near Eastern literature and culture was unprecedented; that he did so in exquisite verse was even more remarkable. He opened up an entire new world of experience and feeling for his readers. At the same time, through the strong passion that animates the book he made the exotic, the alien, somehow familiar; though the settings were bizarre, the passion was recognisable.

The tone and style of the book were unsettling too. Though his penchant for maxim and aphorism was well known, his juxtaposition of these with erotic and sensual motifs represented something new. The sheer exuberance -- what Goethe termed *Übermut* -- of the poems, as well as their stylistic and tonal range, astonished as well: he demonstrated what could be done in verse by drawing on new models, new ways of seeing. Then, too, the very 'Germanness' of the book, an aspect Goethe emphasises, took on an unaccustomed lustre, as though by adopting an 'Eastern' way of []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxxvii}seeing Goethe could cast his own Western culture in a refreshingly skewed but liberating perspective.

Then there are the touches, the little master-strokes, throughout that challenge our preconceptions. The *Divan* is often most memorable in its small effects -- Adam's sneeze in response to the breath of God in his nostrils ('Creating and Enlivening', Poem 8) or the look of a 'wall of rain' with the sun shining through ('Phenomenon', Poem 10). In the twelfth book, Goethe's genial vision of paradise, with its faint echoes of Dante's *Paradiso*, he ends his work with a surprising but very human touch. Who but Goethe on departing from paradise would have given a fond pat to a faithful dog?

### [THE TRANSLATION]{.small} {.h3}

This is the only translation into English of all the poems in the *West-östlicher Divan* with the German text *en face*. It includes Goethe's 'Notes and Essays' as well as the posthumous poems; these poems too are given with the German texts facing. The English translations are in plain prose without the lineation of the originals. This approach seems to me to afford a clearer insight into the German texts than any attempt at a rhyming version; in this I have followed the example of the old Penguin Poetry series with the texts accompanied by prose translations. I have always found that these little paperbacks, whether of Spanish or Italian or Greek poetry, gave me a closer appreciation of the originals than a verse translation could do. Though I have striven first and foremost for accuracy -- not always a straightforward task, given Goethe's particular vocabulary -- I have also struggled to capture something of the tone of the German and occasionally, to give some sense of the cadence of Goethe's verse. Even so, I make no claims that my versions are 'poetical'. They are simply meant to give the reader an introduction to Goethe's poems. I have numbered the poems for ease of reference.

[]{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxxviii}The German texts follow Goethe's originals in every detail of punctuation and orthography; his usages often seem idiosyncratic, particularly in the variations that appear in the poems of the 1827 edition of the *Divan*, where his spelling and punctuation differ from that of the 1819 edition.^[31](#Notes.xhtml_chifn_31){#Introduction.xhtml_chifn31}^ (Most standard editions of the *Divan* normalise and modernise his texts.) In my translations I have not consistently sought to reproduce Goethe's punctuation but have conformed to English usage -- except in those cases where it seemed to me that Goethe's use of dashes, exclamation points and semi-colons signalled some more than ordinary excitation or intention in the original (e.g., 'Another Couple', Poem 29).

I have annotated the poems to explain Arabic or Persian or Turkish references to unfamiliar persons or places. In some cases I consulted the Persian or Arabic originals but in general I relied on Goethe's own sources in the German translations he used. I have also included notes on the German of the texts, especially when the language is archaic or idiosyncratic. I am aware that these annotations are spare indeed, compared to what might be said. Readers who want more detailed information should consult the thousand or so pages of the monumental commentary by Hendrik Birus, listed below. On the other hand, as my academic training was in Islamic Studies, with emphasis on Arabic and Persian, I believe that this may be the only English translation of the *Divan* by someone with an interest, and a background, in matters Islamic.

[]{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xxxix}Finally, with regard to the posthumous poems, I should note that most earlier, standard editions of the *Divan* included sections labelled as 'Posthumous' and 'Paralipomena' (that is, things left over, remnants). Here too I have followed the Birus edition in which these are included in a single section (vol. 1, pp. 583--721). Even so, I have not translated all the material that Birus provides (fragments, pages from Goethe's exercise books, the notations of the 'cipher poems' and other jottings) but have concentrated on the posthumous poems, many of which are worthy of a place in the *Divan* itself.

### [SOURCES]{.small} {.h3}

The German texts given here are taken from the 1819 edition of the *Divan*, with the poems added in 1827 from that edition, as established in the definitive edition of Hendrik Birus in Johann Wolfgang Goethe, *West-östlicher Divan* (second revised edition; Berlin: Deutscher Klassiker Verlag, 2010) in two volumes, first published in 1994 as volume III/1 of Johann Wolfgang Goethe, *Sämtliche Werke. Briefe, Tagebücher und Gespräche in 40 Bänden*. I thank my friend Professor Hinrich Biesterfeldt of the University of Bochum for alerting me to this indispensable edition.

I have used J.W. Goethe, *West-östlicher Divan* (Zürich: Manesse Verlag, 1963), edited by Max Rychner, with his excellent introduction and notes, for the text of the *Noten und Abhandlungen* (though with reference to the text in Birus as well as to the latter's notes). I have consulted Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, *West-östlicher Divan*, edited by Karl Richter with the collaboration of Katharina Mommsen and Peter Ludwig (Munich: Carl Hanser Verlag, 1998) as well. This is volume 2.1.2 of the *Sämtliche Werke nach Epochen seines Schaffens*, the so-called 'Munich Edition'. I have frequently used the superb edition by Erich Trunz in *Goethes Werke, Band II: Gedichte und Epen II* (Munich: C.H. Beck, []{#Introduction.xhtml_page_xl}1989), generally referred to as 'the Hamburg edition'. For the German texts of the poems I have also had occasional recourse to *Gedichte aus dem Nachlass. West-östlicher Divan*, edited by Peter Boerner (Zürich and Stuttgart: Artemis Verlag, 1962), the 'Artemis-Gedenkausgabe'.

After completing the first draft I was able to consult the French translation of the 'Notes and Essays' by Henri Lichtenberger in his *Divan occidental-oriental* (Paris: Aubier/ Editions Montaigne, 1950). I thank my friend, the poet Robert Melançon for bringing this translation to my attention and for lending me his copy. This (rather hard to find) complete translation is now available -- though without Goethe's 'Notes and Essays' -- under the title *Le Divan* in Gallimard's 'Collection Poésie' (Paris: Gallimard, 1984), and I have found it helpful for understanding certain of the poems.

I have also occasionally consulted the English translation of the entire work by Martin Bidney under the title *West-East Divan: the Poems, with 'Notes and Essays': Goethe's Intercultural Dialogues* (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2010), with the 'Notes and Essays' translated by Bidney and Peter Anton von Arnim. Since Bidney here bravely attempts a rhyming verse translation, I found this of little help for an exact understanding of the poems.

I should mention here too the impressive Czech translation of the *Divan* which successfully replicates Goethe's rhyme and metre throughout, published under the title *Zapadovýchodný Díván 1814--1820* (Prague: Nakladatelství Fr. Borový v Praze, 1928) by an unnamed translator (probably Otakar Fischer).

Finally, there are translations of the *Divan* into both Arabic and Persian. The Arabic translation is by *῾*Abd al-Raḥmān Badawī and is entitled *al-Dīwān al-sharqī lil-mu῾allif al-gharbī* (Cairo, 1944); the Persian by Kūrush Safavī with the title *Dīvān-i Gharbī-Sharqī* (Tehran, 2000). I regret that I have not had access to either of these.

</div>

I am grateful to Dr Barbara Haus Schwepcke, director and trustee of Gingko, for inviting me to prepare these texts and translations for publication and for her constant enthusiasm and encouragement during the years the work was in progress. Her meticulous copy-editing of my transcription of the German texts improved my readings, as did her helpful suggestions on the translations.

I thank Bill Swainson, general editor of the *West-Eastern Divan* and of *A New Divan*, for his close and discerning editorial scrutiny of my translations. His comments and suggestions have improved these from beginning to end. His vision of the final shape of the book has guided me throughout. It has been a pleasure to work with him.

I wish to acknowledge the expert contribution of Stephen Brown who copy-edited the 'Notes and Essays' and whose subtle and nuanced knowledge of German improved this part of the work substantially.

I am also indebted to Russell Harris, my friend and former colleague at the Institute of Ismaili Studies, London, who was an early reader of my first version of the 'Notes and Essays' and gave me great encouragement; he also brought the work to the attention of Gingko, for which I am especially grateful.

My friend Professor Hinrich Biesterfeldt of the University of Bochum has been consistently helpful, reading early drafts of several of the Books of the *Divan* and offering both criticisms and suggestions that helped to fine-tune the translations, and I thank him for his assistance and support.

I thank the librarians at the Royal Asiatic Society and the British Library for giving me access to several rare imprints, such as the original editions of Sir William Jones's writings and nineteenth-century Persian lithograph editions. I am grateful too to the Library of the Institute of Ismaili Studies, []{#Acknowledge.xhtml_page_xlii}London, for allowing me to consult its Arabic and Persian collections.

My late friend Christopher Middleton, the superb poet and incomparable translator from the German, offered encouragement that was mischievous but stimulating. When I expressed my enthusiasm for the *Divan*, he replied, 'Oh, it's all guff!' If so, it is glorious guff and I hope to have proved him wrong. I dedicate this translation to his memory.

Out of how many elements should a genuine song be fed, so that ordinary people enjoy it and masters hear it with joy?

Let love above all things be our theme when we sing; if it can penetrate the song, it will sound all the better.

Then the clink of glasses must ring out and the ruby of the wine shine forth: since for lovers, for drinkers, one signals with the loveliest wreaths.

Clang of weapons is also required and that the trumpet sound as well; so that when fortune blazes up, the hero in his victory may be idolised.

Last, it is unavoidable that the poet hate many a thing; and not let what's ill-favoured and ugly live on as though it were beautiful.

And there the scent is as it was in the past, when we suffered still from love and when the strings of my psaltery^[34](#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_34){#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn34}^ contended with the morning sunbeams; when the hunting call from the thickets breathed out the fullness of its rounded tones, to fire us up, to freshen us, how the breast wanted and needed it.

Away with everything that troubles your course! Anything but gloomy striving! Before he sings, before he ceases, the poet must live.

So may life's brazen clang roar through the soul! Should the poet feel dread in his heart, he will find reconciliation within himself.

Poetry is boisterousness, let nobody scold me for that! Be of good hope in your own hot blood, happy and free, like me.

If each hour's agony had a bitter taste for me, I'd be modest too, and even more modest than she.

For modesty is fine and good when a young girl's in bloom; she who runs from roughnecks will be wooed with tenderness.

Modesty is good as well, a wise man says, who can teach me of time and eternity.

Poetry is boisterousness! I prefer to pursue it alone. But you friends and you women, bring your fresh blood to it too!

  HAFIZ   I honour your question and reply to it. Because I preserve in glad memory the sanctified legacy of the Qur'an^[2](#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_2){#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn2}^ without any alteration and so reverently bring it forth that the miseries of the quotidian afflict neither me nor those who treasure the Prophet's word and seed, as is fitting -- this is why I was given the name.
  POET    Because of this, Hafiz, so it appears to me, I would not gladly draw apart from you: for if we think as others do, we come to be like others. And so I am like you utterly for I have taken within myself from our own sacred books^[3](#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_3){#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn3}^ that splendid image of the Lord's likeness that was impressed upon that shroud of shrouds, quickening me in my silent breast, despite denial or oppression's theft,^[4](#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_4){#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn4}^ with the serene image of belief.

Do you know then whom the devils spy upon in the desert,^[5](#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_5){#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn5}^ between cliff and walls? And how they await the moment to seize and lead them off to hell? Liars are they and the evil spirit.

Why does the poet not shrink from allowing such people in!

Does he even know with whom he walks and rambles? He who always traffics only in madness.

## *Fatwa* {.ch-tit1}

In his poetic effects Hafiz delineates perfected truth inexhaustibly; and yet, now and then there are trifles that go beyond the limits of the Law. If you would proceed surely, you have to know how to distinguish between the venom of the snake and its antidote. But to surrender oneself with blithe mind to a pure delight in noble dealing, and with well-considered reflection to guard yourself against those who only pursue eternal pain, is certainly what's best so as not to err. The wretched Abu Su῾ud^[9](#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_9){#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn9}^ wrote this for you. May God forgive him all his sins.

## []{#Chapter_2.xhtml_page_52}21 {.ch-num}

## *The German Gives Thanks* {.ch-tit1}

Holy Abu Su῾ud, you've hit the mark! The poet always wishes for such holy men; for just those very trifles, outside the limits of the Law, are the legacy by which he in high spirits, merry even in sorrow, operates. Snake venom and its antidote must one and the other seem the same to him. That one will not kill, this other will not heal. For true life is the everlasting innocence of action that reveals itself in []{#Chapter_2.xhtml_page_53}such a way that it harms no one but itself. And so the old poet can hope that in paradise the houris will receive him as a transfigured youth. Holy Abu Su῾ud, you've hit the mark!

Daß die Houris ihn im Paradiese,

Als verklärten Jüngling wohl empfangen.

At midnight I was weeping and sobbing, because I was bereft of you. Then night-spirits arrived and I was ashamed. Night-spirits, I said, you find me here sobbing and weeping, I whom you used to pass over while asleep. I am missing great good things. Don't think worse of me whom you once called wise. A great evil has afflicted him! And the night-spirits with long faces passed by, utterly unconcerned as to whether I was wise or foolish.^[17](#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_17){#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn17}^

O how blessed it was for me! I wandered in the countryside where *Hudhud* ^[20](#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_20){#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn20}^ ran along the path. From the ancient sea's shells I searched for those that were petrified; Hudhud ran about, unfurling his crown-crest, in a swaggering, frivolous way, cracking jokes about the dead, the living. Hudhud, I said, Really! You're one fine bird. Hurry up, Hoopoe! Hurry to announce to my beloved that I am hers for ever. As you once played the matchmaker between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba!

'Where did you get this? How could it come to you? How did you get this tinder out of life's plunder, to revive the final glimmer of the spark afresh?'

It ought not be obscure to you, it is a glimmering common to everyone; at immeasurable distance, in the ocean of the stars, I did not lose myself; I was as though newborn.

From the surge of white sheep enveloping the hill, tended by serious shepherds who take pleasure in offering modest hospitality, such peaceful loving folk, each one of whom delights me.

In nights of shuddering, menaced by war, the groaning of the camels shot through the ear and the soul, through the imagination and the swagger, of those who led them.

And always it went further, always it grew broader, and all our dragging effort seemed an eternal flight from the pitched battle of illusory seas,^[1](#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_1){#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn1}^ blue, behind the wasteland and the troops.

## []{#Chapter_5.xhtml_page_125}69 {.ch-num}

No rhymester can be found, who doesn't think himself the best; no fiddler who'd not rather play his own melodies.

And I really couldn't fault them; if we honour others, must we deprecate ourselves? Do we then live if others do?

And this is just what I found to be true in certain antechambers^[2](#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_2){#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn2}^ where nobody knew how to distinguish mouse-shit from coriander-seeds.

What-has-been meant to hate such rough new brooms, but these in turn wouldn't value what-had-once-been broom too.

And when people are divided by mutual contempt, neither will acknowledge that they are striving for the same thing.

And people who have harshly reproved crass self-regard are the very ones who have the hardest time accepting what others have found of value.

If anyone happens to be cheerful and good his neighbour plagues him at once; for as long as the worthy man lives and acts, they'd really rather stone him. But no sooner is he dead than they solicit donations to set up a monument to honour his life of wretchedness. But the mob should really calculate what's to its best advantage. It would really be cleverer to forget the good man for good.

Superiority, you can sense it, cannot be banned from the world; I like to converse with the clever and with despots.

You must not flee before the day: for the day that you hurry towards is no better than the day today; but if you stay happily here where I have set the world aside the better to draw it to me,^[4](#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_4){#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn4}^ you will be safe and secure with me. Today is today, tomorrow tomorrow, and what comes after and what is past, neither tarries nor remains immobile. Stay, O my best-beloved, for it is you who bring it and you who give it.^[5](#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_5){#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn5}^

No wonder that Suleika^[6](#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_6){#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn6}^ was besotted with Joseph; he was young, youth finds favour, he was handsome -- bedazzlingly so, they say -- she was beautiful, they could take delight in one another. But that you, who for so long kept me in yearning, now send me fiery glances of youth, that you now love me, bestow favour on me -- that is what my songs must praise: forever will you be Suleika for me.

Wer sich St. Georgenritter nennet

Denkt nicht gleich Sanct George zu seyn.

Nicht Hatem Thai, nicht der Alles Gebende

Kann ich in meiner Armuth seyn,

Since now you are named Suleika, I too should be given a name. Whenever you praise your beloved, Hatem!^[7](#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_7){#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn7}^ should be the name. Only, if I be acknowledged as such, let it not be seen as presumption: someone who calls himself a knight of St. George doesn't fancy himself St. George on the spot. In my poverty I cannot be Hatim Ta'i, not that all-giving man; nor might I be Hatim Zoghra'i,^[8](#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_8){#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn8}^ richest of all living poets: still, to have both in mind will not be utterly reprehensible; to accept, to bestow, the gifts of good fortune, will always be a huge delight. To pleasure each other lovingly will be the bliss of paradise.

Kenne wohl der Männer Blicke,

Einer sagt: ich liebe, leide!

Ich begehre, ja verzweifle!

Und was sonst ist kennt ein Mädchen.

Alles das kann mir nicht helfen,

Alles das kann mich nicht rühren;

Aber Hatem! deine Blicke

Geben erst dem Tage Glanz.

Denn sie sagen: *Die* gefällt mir,

Wie mir sonst nicht's mag gefallen.

Seh ich Rosen, seh ich Lilien,

Aller Gärten Zier und Ehre,

So Cypressen, Myrten, Veilchen,

Aufgeregt zum Schmuck der Erde;

Und geschmückt ist sie ein Wunder,

Mit Erstaunen uns umfangend,

Uns erquickend, heilend, segnend,

Daß wir uns gesundet fühlen,

Wieder gern erkranken möchten.

Da erblicktest du Suleika

Und gesundetest erkrankend,

Und erkranketest gesundend,

Lächeltelst und sahst herüber

Wie du nie der Welt gelächlet.

Und Suleika fühlt des Blickes

Ewge Rede: *Die* gefällt mir

Wie mir sonst nichts mag gefallen.

How well I know men's glances. One says, 'I love, I suffer! I crave, O I despair!' And all the rest a young girl knows. All that cannot be of help to me, all that cannot touch me; but your glances, O Hatem, give the day its radiance. For they say, 'It's *she* who pleases me, as nothing else can please me. I see roses, I see lilies, the embellishment and honour of all gardens, and so cypresses, myrtles, violets, risen up to adorn the earth; and so adorned she is a miracle, surrounding us with amazement, reviving, healing, blessing us, so that we feel ourselves made healthy, but would wish to be ailing once again.' You glimpse Suleika there, and you are made healthy though being sick, and you sicken while becoming healthy, you smile and you gaze on her as you've never smiled before in this world. And Suleika feels your gaze's everlasting words: 'It's *she* who pleases me, as nothing else can please me.'

The leaf of this tree, that from the East has been entrusted to my garden, gives a secret meaning to savour as it gladdens those who know.

Is it One living being that divides itself within itself? Is it two that have chosen each other so as to be seen as One?

To answer such questions I have discovered the correct sense: do you not feel that in my songs I am both double and One?

A turban was the head-band that beautifully fell in knotted strands from Alexander's head and after him, all successive rulers preferred it to any other as a royal adornment.

It is a turban that graces our Emperor. It's called a crown. The name goes well! Jewels and pearls! May the eye be dazzled! The most beautiful embellishment is always muslin.

  [HATEM]{.small}   Like the polished many-coloured candles in the gold-smith's little stall in the bazaar, so lovely girls surround the almost grey-haired poet.
  [GIRLS]{.small}   Again you're singing of Suleika! We really can't put up with her -- not because of you but because of your songs, we have to envy her.
                    For, even if she were hideous, you'd make her out to be the loveliest creature; in the same way we've read a great deal about Jamil^[27](#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_27){#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn27}^ and Buthaynah.
                    But just because we are pretty, we'd like to be portrayed as well, and if you do it as you should, you'll be quite prettily rewarded too.

On the laden twigs of the shrubs, Beloved, take a look! Let me show you the fruits, their spiky green husks.

For a long time they hang down, clustered, still, unknown to themselves; one branch that wavers and swings rocks them patiently.

But the brown kernel ever ripens within and swells; it longs to reach the air and would love to see the sun.

The husk bursts open and downward with joy it breaks free; just so my songs fall and are heaped in your lap.^[34](#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_34){#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn34}^

[]{#Chapter_8.xhtml_page_231}And so, Beloved, you were given to me to discover the pure pleasure of using rhyme so that I no longer need to envy even Bahram Gur, the Sasanian. I have it too.

You woke up this book in me, you gave it to me, for what I joyously spoke out of the fullness of my heart, echoed back out of your own noble life, as glance to glance, so rhyme to rhyme.

Now may it ring out to you, even from far away; the word comes through, though tone and sound die out. Is it not the mantle still sewn with stars? Is it not the supremely illumined All of love?

## 134 {.ch-num}

To be at one with your glance, your mouth, your breast, to catch your voice, was the final pleasure and the first.

Yesterday, ah, it was the last, and then flame and fire went out, all the light caprice that enchanted me, now turned heavy with care and scarce.

Before it pleases Allah to unite us once again, the sun, the moon, the world itself, give me nothing but occasions to weep.

## *Supreme Image* {.ch-tit1}

The sun, the Helios of the Greeks, moves gloriously along the heavens' path; assured of besieging the cosmos, he looks around, below, above.

He sees the loveliest goddess weeping, the clouds' daughter, heaven's child; he seems to shine for her alone, to all loftier spaces blind.

He sinks down in sorrow and dread and her tears gush down more frequently. He sends delight into her grief, each pearl a kiss upon kiss.

Now she feels deeply the force of his glance, and unswervingly gazes on high; the pearls seem prepared to take shape for each one assumes his image.

And so, wreathed around by hue and rainbow, her face shines brilliantly; drawn to her he comes forward and yet, alas! he cannot reach her.

And so, by the harsh decree of fate, you turn away from me, my best-beloved; and even if I were Helios, what good would my throned chariot be?

It sounds so splendid when the poet likens himself now to the sun, now to the Emperor; but he hides the mournful faces when he slips through murky night.

Caught in streaks of cloud the purest blue of sky sank down into night; my cheeks are pale and gaunt and my heart's tears are grey.

All was mute, still and void; for the first time God was lonely! So He created the dawn that took pity on this agony;^[45](#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_45){#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn45}^ it made a ringing play of colours in the gloom and only now could what had been scattered discover love.

With hurried efforts what belonged together sought each other out, and to life immeasurable both feeling and glance were turned. Be it compelled, be it scrambled together, so long as it assembles and holds! Allah no longer needs to create. We are creating His world.

And so with the wings of rosy dawn, I was drawn to your mouth, and the night with a thousand seals strengthened our starbright bond. On this earth both of us stand as exemplars of joy and pain. And a second word: Be! will not separate us a second time.

Nicht besser dünken,

Wenn man nicht lieben kann

Soll man nicht trinken.

As long as you're sober, you like what's bad. Once you've drunk, you know what's right; still, excess is ever at hand: Hafiz, instruct me how you understood this!

For my opinion is not overblown: if you can't drink, you shouldn't love. But you drinkers shouldn't consider yourselves superior: if you cannot love, you shouldn't drink.

They've complained about us in many ways because of drunkenness and yet, about drunkenness they haven't said it all. It's usual with drunkenness to vanish when dawn breaks; but my drunkenness has tracked me around the whole night long. It is love's drunkenness that plagues me pitifully, from day to night, from night to day it hesitates, in my heart which swells and rises in the drunkenness of song, such that no sober drunkenness can ever soar so high. The drunkenness of love, song and wine, whether by night or by day, the godliest drunkenness that enraptures and tortures me.^[8](#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_8){#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn8}^

  [CUP-BEARER]{.small}   Today you've had a lot to eat and you've had even more to drink; but what you forgot at the meal lies covered in this little bowl.
                         See, we call these 'little swans'^[10](#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_10){#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn10}^ that pleasure the sated guest. I bring this to my swan that proudly breasts the waves.
                         But it's the singing swan that we want to know of, that sings himself into the grave; let me forgo every song if it signifies your end.

  [CUP-BEARER]{.small}   They call you the great poet when you show yourself in the marketplace. I love to hear when you sing and I prick up my ears when you're silent.
                         But I love you even more when you give me a kiss to remember; for words pass over while the kiss remains with me forever.
                         To put rhyme upon rhyme means a lot but it's better still to think. Sing for the others but with the cup-bearer be mute.

  [SAQI]{.small}    Think, my master! When you've been drinking, a fiery blaze glitters all around you! A thousand sparks crackle and flash but you don't know where they catch hold.
                    I see monks in the corners when you pound the table; they conceal themselves, the hypocrites, while you bear your heart wide open.
                    Just tell me why youth, still not free from every fault, so lacking in any virtue, is smarter than old age.
                    You know everything that heaven bears, everything the earth, and you do not conceal the tumult as it rages in your heart.
  [HATEM]{.small}   Because of this, beloved boy, stay young and stay smart; for poetry is a gift from heaven and yet it's a snare in our life on earth.
                    One nurtures it at first in secret, but then one gabbles from morn to night! The poet keeps his mouth shut in vain. Poetry itself is treachery.

A king had two cashiers, one to receive funds, the other to disburse them; the latter spent so lavishly that the other didn't know where to get any cash. The spendthrift died; the king didn't know at first to whom the disburser's office should be given and he hardly had the time to look around when the receiver became enormously rich. Nobody knew what to do with so much gold for in one single day not a cent had been disbursed. Only then did it become clear to the emperor what the source of all that mischief was. He knew how to take advantage of chance to refrain from ever filling that post again.

Coming down from heaven Jesus brought the eternal scripture of the Gospels. He read it by day and by night to his disciples; a divine word, it had its effect and struck home. He rose back to heaven and took it with him; but they had absorbed it well, and each of them wrote, line upon line, what he'd grasped in his mind -- all differently. That doesn't mean a thing: They weren't all equally endowed. Even so, Christians can eke out their lives with it until the Judgement Day.^[5](#Notes.xhtml_ch10fn_5){#Chapter_10.xhtml_ch10fn5}^

Brothers, what legacy should come to you from the poor pious man who is leaving you, whom you younger men have nourished patiently and whose last days you have honoured with your care?

When we often saw the king ride by, all in gold and with gold on every side, with jewels upon him and his great entourage, strewn like densest hail:

Have you ever envied him for that? Haven't you feasted your gaze more gloriously when the sun on the wings of dawn along Damavand's^[1](#Notes.xhtml_ch11fn_1){#Chapter_11.xhtml_ch11fn1}^ numberless peaks

swept upwards in its arc? Who could withhold his gaze from that? I felt, I felt myself a thousand times, over so many days of my life, borne away with the sun as it came,

to behold God on His throne, to name the Lord of life's source, to do justice to that lofty sight, and to pursue my way in its light.

[]{#Chapter_11.xhtml_page_301}But when the fiery sphere rose up in its consummation I stood as though blinded in the darkness, I struck my breast and face forward, flung my cooling limbs to the ground.

And now may a sacred legacy be for the will and the remembrance of my brothers: *the daily observation of strict ritual*, no other revelation is needed.

When a newborn moves his pious hands, so that he may be turned straightaway towards the sun, dunk his body and soul in the fiery bath! He'll sense the benediction of each dawn.

Hand over your dead to the living. Cover over even animals with soil and rubble, and insofar as you are able, cover whatever seems to you impure.

Plough your field in purity that the sun may be pleased to shine on your toil; when you plant trees, let them be in rows for that lets good order flourish.

The water too in your canals should never be without its course or its purity; just as the Zayand-i Rud^[2](#Notes.xhtml_ch11fn_2){#Chapter_11.xhtml_ch11fn2}^ springs purely from its mountain precincts, so should it flow away in purity again.

So as not to weaken the water's soft fall, take care to dredge the ditches assiduously. Reeds and bulrushes, newts and salamanders -- vile creatures -- annihilate them one and all!

Acknowledge with gladness where the flame is burning: Bright is night, and limbs become supple again. By the nimble forces of the hearth, raw animal and plant saps ripen.

Let no one castigate us for teaching such things: to know how all is clarified you must question your own great deeps.

In this way you will perceive that self-satisfied man would like to see his 'I' saved, both up there and here below.

And my own precious 'I' would require many comforts; the joys that I have tasted here I'd like to have in eternity.

Thus, lovely gardens, flowers and fruit and pretty children that filled us all with joy here would please the rejuvenated mind no less.

And so I'd like to gather all friends, young and old, together as one, that they might stammer the words of paradise in the German tongue.

A shepherd took the tender, scantily shod and lightly clothed boys and hid them and himself in a cave in the cliff.

Years come, years go; at last the boys wake up, and the wall, all pitted, has fallen down from age.

### []{#Chapter_13.xhtml_page_345}INTRODUCTION {.h3}

</div>

To every thing there is a season!^[1](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_1){#Chapter_13.xhtml_chfn1}^ -- This is a saying whose significance one appreciates more and more the longer one lives. And so there's a time to be silent and another time to speak, and it's this second time upon which the poet has now resolved. For if action and effect are right for youth, thoughtful communication is more apt for maturity.

I sent the writings of my early years without any preface into the world and gave not the slightest indication as to what I intended by them. This occurred because I believed that sooner or later the nation would find some use in what I'd offered. As a result, several of my works had an instantaneous effect, while others, not so simple and brash, needed several years to be acknowledged. Those years did pass nevertheless and a second, and a third, successive generation repaid me two- and threefold for the incivilities I'd had to endure from my earlier contemporaries.

But this time I want nothing to obstruct a good first impression of the present book. Therefore I've decided to elucidate and explain and instruct, and to do so solely so that readers who have little or no familiarity with the East may gain a more immediate understanding. Conversely, those who are better acquainted with this utterly astonishing part of the world will have no need whatsoever of this excursus, the purpose of which is to mark, lightly enough, the springs and brooks whose quickening waters I have conveyed to my garden plot.

Still, the author of the preceding poems would like best of all to be seen as a traveller for whom it is praise enough if []{#Chapter_13.xhtml_page_346}he adapts comfortably and sympathetically to foreign ways, both aspiring to make other forms of expression his own and understanding how to enter into and assume other ways of thinking, other customs. He may be excused if he succeeds in this only to a certain degree, if he remains recognisable as a foreigner by his accent and the ineradicable fixity of his national identity. May this little book of mine garner forgiveness in this spirit! Experts are perceptive enough to forgive while amateurs are less bothered by such shortcomings and easily accept what is offered.

So that what the traveller brings back may all the more swiftly give pleasure to his compatriots, he may take on the role of the merchant who spreads out his wares attractively and strives in various ways to make them appealing; nor will anyone begrudge him for publicising, describing and even praising his wares in his words.

First and foremost, therefore, our poet should declare that he has made clarity in both ethical and aesthetic matters his primary duty; for this reason, he has committed himself to the simplest language and the easiest, most comprehensible words in his own tongue and has only sparingly suggested that artifice and affectation by which the Oriental seeks to please.

Even so, the reader's understanding will be hampered by the use of a number of foreign words, unavoidably so; words which are obscure because they refer to specific objects, to beliefs, opinions, traditions, fables and customs. To elucidate these may be considered the next obligation and addresses a need arising from the questions and objections of German hearers and readers. An accompanying guide to the contents^[2](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_2){#Chapter_13.xhtml_chfn2}^ indicates the page where obscure passages occur, as well as where they are explained. This explanation, however, comes in a certain context, so that, rather than incoherent notes, a self-sufficient text may emerge which, though only rapidly []{#Chapter_13.xhtml_page_347}and loosely linked together, still may afford the reader both elucidation and a wider view.

May the effort involved in our present endeavour be congenial! We may presume to hope so. For in a period in which so much from the East has been faithfully assimilated into our language, may it seem worthwhile if we too seek, from our perspective, to draw attention to a place from which so much greatness, beauty and goodness have come to us over the centuries, and from which more is to be expected every day.

[]{#Chapter_14.xhtml}

### [HEBREWS]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

For every nation a naïve art of poetry comes first and lies at the foundation of all that comes afterward. The greater the freshness and naturalness with which it emerges, the more felicitously will its succeeding epochs develop.

Since we are discussing the poetry of the East, it is necessary to consider the Bible, as the oldest such collection. A large part of the Old Testament is written in an exalted mood, and enthusiastically so, and belongs to the realm of poetry.

If we retain a lively recollection of that time when Herder and Eichhorn personally enlightened us about this, so do we call back to mind a sublime delight, comparable with the pristine sunrise in the east.^[3](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_3){#Chapter_14.xhtml_chfn3}^ What such men imparted and bequeathed to us can now only be hinted at, and we must hope to be pardoned for the haste with which we pass these treasures by.

Even so, for the sake of an example, we recall the Book of Ruth which with its lofty purpose of furnishing a king of []{#Chapter_14.xhtml_page_348}Israel with lively and upstanding forefathers can be considered at the same time as the most precious tiny whole, both epic and idyllic, which has been handed down to us.

For a moment we pause too at the Song of Solomon, the tenderest and most inimitable expression of passionate and gracious love which has come down to us. Of course, we bemoan the fact that this fragmentary, jumbled and tangled poem affords no complete and pristine delight; and yet, we feel thrilled to insinuate ourselves into those very circumstances which the poet lived through. The gentle breeze of Canaan's most delightful region blows throughout: familiar rural conditions, the work of vineyard, garden and field, a little urban confinement but then a royal court with all its splendours in the background. And still the central theme continues to be the glowing attraction of youthful hearts, which search out and find one another, both rebuff and allure, under all sorts of quite simple conditions.

More than once we considered extracting some passages from this delightful confusion and setting them side by side; and yet, it is just the enigmatic and inscrutable aspect which gives these few pages their loveliness and inimitable quality. How often have not well-meaning minds, bewitched by order, been tempted to discover -- or to insert -- some plausible context and yet after each one the work remains as it always was.

In much the same way, the Book of Ruth has worked its irresistible charm over so many a hardy fellow so that he has devoted himself to the daft attempt to improve that incomparably laconic narration by means of more expansive and periphrastic treatment.

Thus, book by book, the Book of all books proves that it was given to us so that we might make the attempt to educate, enlighten and lose ourselves within it, as in another world.

Among one eastern people, the Arabs, we find splendid treasures in the *Moallakat.* These were panegyrics which emerged triumphantly from the competitions of poets: poems, originating from before Muhammad's time, written in letters of gold and suspended over the portals of the House of God in Mecca. They signal a nomadic bellicose nation, rich in herds, troubled by the internal rivalries of various tribes. Depicted in these poems are: the stubbornest allegiance to fellow tribesmen, a craving for honour, valour, an unappeasable thirst for vengeance, softened by the sorrows of love, by benevolence and self-sacrifice, of limitless extent. These poems offer us sufficient sense of the high culture of the tribe of the Quraysh, from which Muhammad himself sprang, but over which he cast a sombre veil of religion and thereby sought to conceal any prospect of genuine progress.

The value of these superb poems, seven in number, is augmented by the fact that the greatest variety predominates within them. Here we can give no briefer or worthier account of them than to interpose what the judicious Jones^[4](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_4){#Chapter_15.xhtml_chfn4}^ says of their character:

::: top
The poem of Imru'l-Qays is tender, glad, glittering, graceful, diverse and lovely. Tarafa's is bold, aroused, bounding, but woven through with a certain gaiety. The poem of Zuhayr is sharp, solemn, chaste, full of moralistic injunctions and grave sayings. Labid's poem is light, amorous, gracious and tender; it calls Virgil's second []{#Chapter_15.xhtml_page_350}*Eclogue* to mind: for it laments the pride and haughtiness of the Beloved and seizes the opportunity to enumerate her virtues in order to exalt the renown of her clan to the very skies. *῾*Antara's poem is proud, menacing, apposite, grand, yet not lacking in beautiful descriptions and images. *῾*Amr is fierce, exalted, boastful; Harith by contrast is full of wisdom, wit and dignity. The two latter poems also represent poetical and political battle orations, which were delivered before an assembly of Arabs in order to still the destructive hatred of two tribes!
:::

Since with this snippet we'll surely prompt our readers to read or reread these poems, we now add another from the time of Muhammad, which is wholly in this spirit; its character might be described as sombre, even dark, yet glowing, hot for revenge and sated by vengeance:^[5](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_5){#Chapter_15.xhtml_chfn5}^

## 1 {.ch-num}

Beneath the cliff along the path

He lies struck down,

And no drops of dew trickle

Down into his blood.

## []{#Chapter_15.xhtml_page_351}2 {.ch-num}

He placed a heavy burden on me

And departed;

And yet, I shall shoulder

This burden.

## 3 {.ch-num}

'The heir of my vengeance

Is my nephew,

The contentious,

The irreconcilable.

## 4 {.ch-num}

Dumbly he sweats the venom out,

As the viper is still,

As the snake exudes its venom,

Which no charm can counteract.'

## 5 {.ch-num}

A terrible message came to us

Of great and mighty misfortune;

It overmastered

The strongest among us.

## 6 {.ch-num}

Fate has devastated me,

Wounding the friend

Whose guest

Was never harmed.

## *7* {.ch-aut}

He was the sun's warmth

On a cold day;

And when Sirius scorched,

He was coolness and shade.

## []{#Chapter_15.xhtml_page_352}8 {.ch-num}

Lean of hip,

Not distressed,

Warm-handed,

Bold and powerful.

## 9 {.ch-num}

With firmness of mind

He pursued his goal,

Until he rested;

Then his firm mind rested too.

## 10 {.ch-num}

He was a raincloud,

Distributing gifts;

A ferocious lion

When he attacked.

## 11 {.ch-num}

Majestic before his people,

Black-haired, in long robes;

A lean wolf

Running against the foe.

## 12 {.ch-num}

Two flavours had he,

Honey and colocynth;

Dishes so flavoured

Everyone tasted.

## 13 {.ch-num}

He rode alone and terrifiying,

No one went with him

But his sword from the Yemen

Adorned with nicks.

## []{#Chapter_15.xhtml_page_353}14 {.ch-num}

At noon we young men

began The hostile campaign,

Rode through the night

Like restless and drifting clouds.

## 15 {.ch-num}

Each one was a sword,

Strapped about with a sword,

But ripped from its sheath

A glittering lightning bolt.

## 16 {.ch-num}

They sipped from the spirits of sleep;

But when they nodded their heads

We struck them

And they were gone.

## 17 {.ch-num}

We took our revenge in full;

Out of two tribes

Few escaped,

The least of them.

## 18 {.ch-num}

And if the Hudhaylite

Broke his lance to destroy him,

It is because he broke

The Hudhaylites with his lance.

## 19 {.ch-num}

They laid him down

On the rough resting place,

On the steep cliff where even the camels

Shatter their hooves.

## []{#Chapter_15.xhtml_page_354}20 {.ch-num}

When the morning greeted him there,

The murdered man, in that dreary place,

He was despoiled,

His plunder pillaged.

## 21 {.ch-num}

But now the Hudhaylites have been

Slaughtered by me with deep wounds.

Misfortune does not cow me;

Misfortune itself is cowed.

## 22 {.ch-num}

The thirst of the spear has been quenched

At its first slurp

And drinking again and again

Was not forbidden it.

## 23 {.ch-num}

Now wine is permitted once more

Which once was forbidden;

Through heavy toil

I won that permission.

## 24 {.ch-num}

By sword and lance

And by my horse I won

The privilege

That now is the property of all.

## 25 {.ch-num}

Reach me the goblet then,

O Sawad ibn *῾*Amr:

For the sake of my uncle,

My body is one great wound.

## []{#Chapter_15.xhtml_page_355}26 {.ch-num}

And we handed the cup of death

To the Hudhaylites,

Whose effect is lamentation,

Blindness and abasement.

## 27 {.ch-num}

Then the hyenas laughed

At the deaths of the Hudhaylites,

And you saw wolves

Whose muzzles gleamed.

## 28 {.ch-num}

The noblest vultures flew down,

They strutted from corpse to corpse,

And so rich was the banquet spread there

They could not lift off to the heights.

Little is required for an understanding of this poem. The largeness of character, the seriousness, the justifiable cruelty of the action are genuine characteristics of the poetry. The first two stanzas offer a clear exposition; in the third and fourth, the dead man speaks and obliges his kinfolk to avenge him. The fifth and sixth are linked contextually with the first and are lyrically interchangeable; the seventh to thirteenth exalt the murdered man so that the magnitude of his loss may be felt. The fourteenth to seventeenth stanzas describe the expedition against the foe; the eighteenth turns backwards again; the nineteenth and twentieth could find a place just after the two first stanzas. The twenty-first and twenty- second could be positioned after the seventeenth; thus, the joy and savour of victory follow in the banquet, while the frightful joy of seeing the enemy struck down, a prey to hyenas and vultures, forms the conclusion.

It strikes us as quite remarkable that in this poem the purely prosaic treatment of the action becomes poetic through []{#Chapter_15.xhtml_page_356}a transposition of the individual events. Accordingly, while the poem dispenses with virtually all exterior embellishment, its gravity is heightened; whoever reads it aright is compelled to glimpse the course of events, from beginning to end, built up bit by bit out of sheer force of imagination.

If now we turn to the Persians, a peaceable and cultivated people, we must go back -- since it was their poetry which in fact prompted the present work -- to the earliest period, in order that we may better understand the more recent \[poetry\]. To the historical researcher it always seems remarkable that however often a country may have been conquered, subjugated, or even extirpated, a certain core of the nation is retained in its character and when one least expects it, an old, long-known manifestation of a people steps forth once again.

With this in mind, may it be congenial to hear of the ancient Persians and thereby all the more surely and freely guide our steps rapidly up to the present day!

[]{#Chapter_17.xhtml}

### [ANCIENT PERSIANS]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

For the early Parsees,^[6](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_6){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn6}^ worship of God was based on the observation of nature. In praying to the creator, they turned towards the rising sun as the most striking and splendid of his manifestations. There they believed to glimpse God's throne glitteringly encircled by angels. Everyone, even the lowest, could summon the glory of this uplifting service daily to mind. The poor man emerged from his hut, the warrior came forth from his tent, and the most religious of all []{#Chapter_17.xhtml_page_357}functions was consummated. The baptismal fire was imparted to the newborn child in such rays and all day long, over an entire lifetime, the Parsee felt himself to be accompanied in all he did by that primordial star. Stars and moon -- though equally unreachable, allied as they are with the unbounded -- illumined the night. And yet, fire stood by, brightening and warming everyone in proportion to his means. To address prayers in the presence of this representative, to bow down before this infinitely sensitive being, was a pious and pleasant duty. Nothing is purer than a serene sunrise and with just such purity man should kindle and conserve the fire so that it be, and remain, holy like the sun.

Zoroaster seems at first to have transformed this noble pristine nature religion into a meticulous order of worship. Mental prayer, which encompasses and precludes all religions and penetrates down to the whole way of life of only a few God-favoured people, develops in most people only as the ardent and exhilarating sensation of a moment; and after it vanishes, the dissatisfied, unoccupied human being, thrown back upon himself, plunges at once into the most protracted boredom.

To fill this up meticulously with ceremonies, consecration and absolution, toings and froings, bowings and scrapings, is the duty and the prerogative of the priesthood which then century after century breaks its offices down into unending minutiae. Anyone who takes a rapid overview from the earliest, childishly delighted reverence for a rising sun to the crazed behaviour of the Guebres,^[7](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_7){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn7}^ as still occurs even today in India, may glimpse on the one side a fresh new nation rousing itself from sleep at the first light of dawn, and on the other, a benighted people trying to kill ordinary boredom through the boredom of piety.

Nevertheless, it's important to note that the ancient []{#Chapter_17.xhtml_page_358}Parsees did not revere fire alone. Their religion is based on the worth of the combined elements inasmuch as they proclaim God's existence and might. From this comes the holy dread of polluting water, air and earth. Such reverence before everything which surrounds man in nature is conducive to civic virtues: attentiveness, cleanliness, industriousness are prompted and sustained. The cultivation of the land depended on this; for just as they polluted no river, so too were the canals constructed and kept clean with careful conservation of water, and from their circulation the fruitfulness of the land sprang forth, so that the kingdom of that period was cultivated tenfold more. Everything upon which the sun smiled was tended with the greatest zeal but above all, the vineyard, the sun's own closest child.

The unusual manner in which they buried their dead derives from the same extreme interdict against defiling the pure elements. The police force itself acted in accord with these principles; the cleanliness of the streets was a religious matter. Even today, when the Guebres have been driven out, thrust aside, despised and may only dwell in disreputable quarters on the city outskirts, a dying person of this denomination may bequeath a sum so that one or another street of the capitol can be thoroughly cleaned. It was through such a lively, practical worship of God that that incredible spread of population, to which history bears witness, became possible.

Such a gentle religion, based upon the omnipresence of God in His works in the sensory realm, must exert a particular influence on morals. Consider its commandments and prohibitions: not to lie, to incur no debts, not to be ungrateful! Every moralist and ascetic will easily cultivate such teachings fruitfully. For the first commandment really comprises the two others and all the rest which arise solely from untruthfulness and infidelity. For this reason in the East the devil is designated simply as the eternal Liar.

Since this religion is conducive to contemplative tranquillity, however, it can easily lead to softness, just as there is []{#Chapter_17.xhtml_page_359}something feminine too in the long white garments. And yet, in their dispositions and manners there was also a powerful counter-effect. They bore arms, even during peacetime and in civic life, and exercised in their use in every conceivable way. The most skilful and boisterous horsemanship was customary among them; even their games -- such as that played with ball and club on huge courses^[8](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_8){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn8}^ -- kept them fit, strong and nimble, while a remorseless system of conscription turned them all, at the monarch's slightest nod, into heroes.

Let us take a retrospective glance at their sense of God. Originally the public cult was limited to a few fires and was all the more awe-inspiring; then a priesthood invested with great dignity grew by leaps and bounds and the fires too proliferated. That this profoundly inward spiritual force could occasionally rise up against its more worldly rival lies in the very nature of this perennially incompatible relationship -- not to mention that the false Smerdis^[9](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_9){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn9}^ who ruled the realm was himself a Magus^[10](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_10){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn10}^ and elevated and supported by his colleagues for a time; so too we encounter the Magi often inspiring dread in rulers.

Dispersed by Alexander's invasion, not finding favour among his Parthian successors, again raised up and assembled by the Sasanians, they showed themselves ever steadfast to their precepts and worked in opposition to any ruler who disobeyed them. In just this way they rebelled in disgust in every way they could against both sides of the relationship between Chosroes and the lovely Shirin, a Christian.^[11](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_11){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn11}^

Dislodged at last by the Arabs and driven into India, with what remained of them or their spiritual allies in Persia despised and reviled up to the present day -- now tolerated, []{#Chapter_17.xhtml_page_360}now persecuted according to the whim of a ruler -- this religion still persists here and there in its pristine purity, even in wretched outposts, as the poet attempted to put into words in his 'The Legacy of Old Persian Belief'.^[12](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_12){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn12}^

That we are indebted to this religion for a great deal over a long stretch of time, that the possibility of a higher culture lay in it and spread over the western portion of the eastern world, is not in doubt. To be sure, it's extremely difficult to give some sense of how and where this culture extended. Many cities scattered over several regions were vital centres; however, to me the most amazing fact is that the fatal proximity of Indian idol-worship was unable to affect it. It remains striking that the cities of Balkh and Bamiyan stood so near to one another, here the wildest idols were to be seen, fabricated and worshipped on a colossal scale while there the temples of the Pure Fire were kept, large convents of devotees arose and a swarm of Mobeds^[13](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_13){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn13}^ gathered. Just how magnificent the furnishings of such structures must have been is attested by the extraordinary men who emerged from them: the family of the Barmakids,^[14](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_14){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn14}^ who for so long shone as influential officials, until they were at last (like a somewhat similar race of this kind in our own times)^[15](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_15){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn15}^ exterminated and expelled.

#### []{#Chapter_17.xhtml_page_361}*Governance* {#Chapter_17.xhtml_ch17-1 .h4}

If the philosopher constructs a natural, national or governmental system of law on the basis of principles, the historically minded investigator seeks to determine how these situations and relationships have functioned over time. We discover then that in the most ancient Orient all sovereignty derived from the right to declare war. This right lay, like all else, at first in the will and fervour of the people. When one member of a tribe was injured, the remainder rose unbidden to wreak vengeance on the offender. But because the multitude can of course act and deal but cannot lead itself, it delegates leadership in battle -- whether by election, custom or habit -- to a single individual, either for one campaign or for several; to a truly capable man it confers that hazardous position for his lifetime and indeed, even for his posterity. Thus it comes about that the one person capable of waging a war acquires the right to declare a war.

From this circumstance flows the authority to compel, muster and summon into battle each and every citizen who can be considered willing and ready for combat. Such conscription, to be just and effective, had to be pitiless. Darius the First^[16](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_16){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn16}^ armed himself against dangerous neighbours and his vast populace responded to the hint. An elderly man delivers his three sons with the plea to release the youngest from the campaign and the king returns the boy to him hacked into pieces. The right over life and death is thus made explicit. In battle itself no questioning can be tolerated: for doesn't it often come to pass that a whole division is readily and clumsily sacrificed without anyone bringing the leader to account?

Nevertheless, among warlike peoples the same conditions occur during the brief periods of peace. It is always war in the king's circle and nobody at court can be sure of his life. Just so are taxes raised; war makes them indispensable. For this []{#Chapter_17.xhtml_page_362}reason as well Darius Codomannus^[17](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_17){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn17}^ prudently assigned fixed regular remittances in place of voluntary contributions. On this basis and with this disposition, Persian kingship rose to supreme might and felicity, only to founder in the end through the proud nobility of a small, fragmented, neighbouring people.^[18](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_18){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn18}^

#### *History* {#Chapter_17.xhtml_ch17-2 .h4}

After exceptional princes had consolidated their fighting forces and brought the flexibility of the masses to its highest level, the Persians appeared dangerous even to far-flung peoples, let alone to those next door.

All were conquered; only the Greeks, disunited among themselves, banded together against the innumerable, everonrushing foe, and made exemplary sacrifice -- the first virtue and the last, in which all others are implicit. In this way they gained respite so that, as Persian might toppled from within, Philip of Macedon could form a united front, gather remaining Greeks around himself and in exchange for the loss of their individual autonomy prepare for a victory over oppressors from without. His son invaded the Persians and won the empire.

They had made themselves not only dreaded but thoroughly hated by the Greek nation, for they waged war against both the state and the religion at the same time. Devotees of a religion in which the heavenly bodies, fire and the elements were revered as godlike entities in the world at large, they found it utterly reprehensible that others could confine their gods in dwelling-places and pray to them under roofs. So they torched and razed the temples and in so doing erected monuments that inspired everlasting hatred of themselves, for the Greeks in their wisdom decided never to raise the []{#Chapter_17.xhtml_page_363}temples again out of their ashes but instead vindictively left them lying, in order to provoke future revenge. This determination to revenge their own sullied religious sites the Greeks brought with them onto Persian soil; much cruelty becomes explicable as a result, such that even the burning of Persepolis could thereby be excused.

The cultic practices of the Magians, which -- far removed from their original simplicity -- required temples and convents, were also destroyed, the Magians themselves hunted down and dispersed; nevertheless, many of them assembled in hiding to preserve both belief and divine service for a more propitious time. Indeed, their patience was very sorely tested. Upon the death of Alexander, his brief hegemony collapsed and the empire shattered; the Parthians seized control of the part which particularly concerns us at present. The language, customs and religion of the Greeks were native to them. And so five hundred years swept over the ashes of the old temples and altars amid which the sacred fire was kept continually glimmering, so that when the Sasanians, still professing the old beliefs, restored the earlier cult, at the beginning of the third century of our era, a number of Magians and Mobeds, who had secretly preserved themselves and their convictions along and across the border with India, at once appeared. The old Persian language was reintroduced, Greek was proscribed, and the foundation was laid again for a national identity. Now, over a period of four centuries, we discover the mythical prehistory of events in Persia preserved to some extent through echoes in both poetry and prose. This glorious dawn affords unending delight; the multiplicity of characters and happenings awakens enormous interest.

What we understand of the art and architecture of this epoch, however, seems to involve little more than pomp and splendour, magnitude and spaciousness; and how could it be otherwise, since they were obliged to derive their art from the West, itself already so profoundly debased. The poet himself possesses a seal ring of Shapur the First, an onyx, obviously []{#Chapter_17.xhtml_page_364}incised by a western artisan of the period, perhaps a prisoner of war.^[19](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_19){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn19}^ And should the seal-carver of the conquering Sasanians have been any more skilful than the seal-carver of conquered Valentinian?^[20](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_20){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn20}^ How the situation looks with the coins of that period is, alas, all too familiar to us. Even the poetic and fabulous elements of those surviving monuments have been degraded little by little into historical prose through the efforts of connoisseurs. From this example we can easily grasp how a people can stand on a high ethical and religious level, surround themselves with pomp and pageantry and yet still be considered barbarians with respect to the arts.

Nevertheless, if we are to value Oriental -- and especially Persian -- poetry of a later period (without exaggerating its merits to our own eventual distaste and embarrassment), we must also consider where true and estimable poetry really may be found in those times.

If one keeps India pre-eminently in view, not very much seems to have been lost from the West to the Near East; but even though that madly monstrous religion^[21](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_21){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn21}^ could not be acceptable in any way to worshippers of fire and the elements, any more than that abstruse philosophy would be to a person of vitality; even so there were writings of worldly wisdom from there \[India\] which were accepted as wholly welcome to all humanity; for the *Fables* of Bidpai^[22](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_22){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn22}^ were held in the highest esteem and thereby wrecked a future poetry in its deepest sense. From that same source we also have chess, []{#Chapter_17.xhtml_page_365}a game which (in league with that same worldly wisdom)[23](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_23){#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn23} is wholly devoted to the ruination of the poetic spirit. Keeping this presupposition in mind, we shall come to praise and admire the naturalness of the later Persian poets exceedingly (as soon as they may be invoked in a befitting context) and the way in which they struggle to sidestep and perhaps even triumph over such disadvantages.

The proximity of Byzantium, the wars with the emperors of the West, and the fluctuating circumstances which result, end up producing a mixture in which the Christian religion intertwines with that of the old Parsees, though not without remonstrances from the Mobeds and local guardians of the faith. But how many troubles, indeed the great calamity itself which assailed that outstanding prince, Chosroes Parviz, had their origin in this circumstance, all the more so because the charming and adorable Shirin held fast to her Christian faith!

All this, even considered in cursory fashion, impels us to declare that the precepts and the practices of the Sasanians are fully worthy of praise; they were simply not powerful enough to save themselves when they stood ringed about by enemies in a most turbulent time. After a decent resistance they were subjugated by the Arabs whom Muhammad had unified into a terrifying force.

### [MUHAMMAD]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

In these reflections we take poetry as our point of departure or we come back to it, and so it will suit our purpose to state from the very outset with respect to the above-named extraordinary man that he vehemently asserts and protests that he is a prophet and not a poet; furthermore, that his Qur'an is to be regarded as divine law, not as a human book meant to instruct or to entertain. Were we to indicate the distinction between poets and prophets more closely, we might say that []{#Chapter_18.xhtml_page_366}both are seized and fired by a god. But the poet squanders the gift accorded to him in pleasure in order to bring forth pleasure, to demand honour for what he has produced and, in any event, a pleasant life.^[24](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_24){#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn24}^ He neglects all other goals while striving to be manifold, to reveal himself as boundless in both his nature and his self-manifestation. By contrast, the prophet considers only a single determined purpose and employs the simplest means to attain it. He means to proclaim some sort of teaching and to gather people around it as around a standard. To this end all that's needed is that the world believe; and so he must be -- and remain -- monothematic. For the manifold is not something one believes in, it is something one acknowledges.

The entire content of the Qur'an, to put it briefly, may be found at the beginning of the second sura and runs as follows:

::: top
There is no doubt in this book. It is a direction for the pious, who believe in the mysteries of faith, who observe the appointed times of prayer, and distribute alms out of what we have bestowed on them; and who believe in that revelation, which hath been sent down unto thee, and that which hath been sent down unto the prophets before thee, and have firm assurance in the life to come: these are directed by their Lord, and they shall prosper. As for the unbelievers, it will be equal to them whether thou admonish them, or do not admonish them; they will not believe. God hath sealed up their hearts and their hearing; a dimness covereth their sight, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment.^[25](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_25){#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn25}^
:::

[]{#Chapter_18.xhtml_page_367}Thus does the Qur'an repeat itself in sura after sura. Belief and unbelief are divided into higher and lower; heaven and hell are intended for believers and deniers, respectively. The close determination of the prescribed and the forbidden, fabulous tales taken from the Jewish and Christian religions, all sorts of amplifications, endless tautologies and repetitions compose the stuff of this sacred book which, whenever we turn to it, always freshly repels us but then once again draws us to it, arouses amazement and in the end demands reverence.

Still, to express what must remain of the utmost importance in this book for every student of history, we cite the words of an eminent man:

::: top
The principal aim of the Qur'an seems to have been to bring together the adherents of the three discrete religions prevailing at that time in populous Arabia, who for the most part lived and mingled with one another day by day and who roamed without either flocks or way-markers -- the majority of whom were idol worshippers and the rest either Jews or Christians of exceedingly deviant and heretical beliefs -- in acknowledgement and reverence for the one, eternal and invisible God through whose might all things were made, and which could not have been so made otherwise; the supreme ruler, the judge and the lord of lords, amid the confirmation of certain laws and the outward signs of certain ceremonies -- some of older and some of newer provenance -- and made vivid by the depiction of both temporal and eternal rewards and punishments; and in this way to bring them all to obedience to Muhammad as the Prophet and Emissary of God, who through continually repeated reminders, promises and threats from earlier times might at last through force of arms transmit and establish God's true religion on earth, and so be acknowledged as high priest, bishop or pope in the []{#Chapter_18.xhtml_page_368}things of the spirit, and also a lofty prince in the things of this world.^[26](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_26){#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn26}^
:::

With this in mind, it's hard to be vexed by the Muslim when he terms the time before Muhammad as 'the time of ignorance', and is utterly convinced that both enlightenment and wisdom begin with the coming of Islam. The Qur'an's style is on a par with its purpose and content: strong, great, frightening, in passages truly exalted; thus it drives a wedge and no one can really be surprised at the book's huge effectiveness. For this reason it is also held by true believers to be uncreated and declared co-eternal with God. In disregard of this, however, there were some bright minds who acknowledged that a superior style of poetry and of writing belonged to the earlier period and they claimed that if it hadn't pleased God to reveal his will and a definite legal system all at once through Muhammad, the Arabs would have gradually risen to such a stage, and an even higher one, on their own and would have developed yet purer concepts in a pristine language.

Others, more audacious, maintained that Muhammad had ruined their speech and their literature so that they could never again be recovered. But the boldest of all, a brilliant poet, was rash enough to assert that everything which Muhammad had expressed he himself would have expressed as well, and better, and he went so far as to collect a number of sectarians around him. As a result, he was given the mocking sobriquet Mutanabbi, the name under which we know him and which means 'someone who likes to play the prophet'.^[27](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_27){#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn27}^

Whether or not Muslim criticism itself found doubtful matter in the Qur'an, inasmuch as passages which appeared []{#Chapter_18.xhtml_page_369}earlier are no longer present, and others of a contradictory nature rescind one another,^[28](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_28){#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn28}^ along with the unavoidable lacunae which occur in all scriptural transmissions, even so, this book will remain supremely effective for all time to come, in that it is utterly practical and composed in accord with the needs of a people which bases its renown on old traditions and holds fast to customary ways.

In his aversion to poetry Muhammad also seems highly consistent; he proscribes all tales. These games of frivolous imaginative power, which float back and forth from the real up to the downright impossible, and present the improbable as worthy of truth and beyond all doubt, were extremely suited to Oriental sensuality, to soft torpor and easy idleness. Such airy fancies wafting over marvellous ground had by the Sasanian period increased beyond measure. The *Thousand and One Nights*, strung on their loose thread, provide us with examples. Their true nature is that they lack any ethical purpose and so lead and transport people not back to themselves but outward, beyond themselves, into a free space without bounds. Muhammad meant to effect exactly the opposite. It is obvious that he knew just how to transform the traditions and reports of the Old Testament and the events in the families of the patriarchs -- which of course rested on unconditional faith in God, undeviating obedience (hence, in the same way, on an 'Islam')^[29](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_29){#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn29}^ -- into legends; that he understood increasingly how to articulate and to urge belief in God, trust and obedience, with shrewd command of detail; and in so doing he came to allow much that was fabulous though only if it served his purpose. In this respect he is admirable if one looks and considers the stories of Noah, Abraham and Joseph.

But to return to our actual subject, we repeat that the Sasanians ruled for four hundred years, not at the end perhaps with their former might and brilliance, and yet they might have maintained themselves for a while longer had the power of the Arabs not grown such that no other kingdom was capable of opposing them. Under ῾Umar, not long after Muhammad, that dynasty collapsed which had cultivated old Persian religion and diffused an uncommon level of culture.

The Arabs at once went on a rampage against all books which in their view were merely superfluous or harmful; they destroyed all the monuments of literature so that scarcely the slightest fragments have come down to us. The Arabic language, immediately introduced, blocked any reconstruction of anything which might be termed national.^[30](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_30){#Chapter_19.xhtml_chfn30}^ Nevertheless, here too the culture of the conquered gradually prevailed over the crassness of the conquerors; the Muslim victors took pleasure in the love of splendour, the genial customs and poetical lineaments of the vanquished. Accordingly the period when the Barmakids held sway in Baghdad still remains celebrated as the most brilliant. Originating from Balkh, not themselves monks but rather patrons and protectors of the great cloisters and cultural institutions, they preserved the sacred fire of eloquence and the art of poetry in their midst, and through their worldly wisdom and greatness of character, they claimed a high rank even in the political realm.^[31](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_31){#Chapter_19.xhtml_chfn31}^ As a result the 'time of the Barmakids' has become proverbial for a period of local and lively character and creativity which -- when it has passed -- one can only hope may perhaps []{#Chapter_19.xhtml_page_371}after a long time spring up again in foreign places under similar circumstances.

The Caliphate too was of brief duration. The vast empire lasted for hardly four hundred years. The more remote governors made themselves steadily more and more independent even as they upheld the validity of the Caliph as a spiritual force conferring titles and benefices.

### [FURTHER OBSERVATION]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

No one will deny a physical and climatic influence on the formation of the human figure and its bodily qualities; and yet, it's not always acknowledged that the form of a regime also produces a moral and climatic condition through which characters take shape in various ways. We are speaking here not of the common run of humanity but of significant and superior figures.

In a republic, characters are formed which are large, felicitous and calmly committed to action. If this rises to an aristocracy, then men of consequence -- worthy, adept men as admirable in taking orders as in giving them -- make their appearance. Should a state plunge into anarchy, bold, reckless men, scornful of proprieties, swagger forth, resorting in a flash to violence to the point of terror and relinquishing all restraint. Despotism by contrast hews grand characters: cunning, calm oversight, severity of action, firmness, decisiveness -- all the traits necessary for the service of despots develop in capable spirits and secure for them the leading positions in the state where they are formed to become rulers themselves. Such men flourished under Alexander the Great, whose generals, after his premature death, at once stepped forth as monarchs. The Caliphs became laden with a gigantic empire that they had to have administered by governors whose power and autonomy flourished as the strength of the supreme ruler was diminished. Such an outstanding man, who grasped []{#Chapter_20.xhtml_page_372}the way to found his own empire and the way to use it, is the man of whom we now have to speak, in order to acquire some familiarity with the foundation of the new Persian poetry and its significant beginnings.

[]{#Chapter_21.xhtml}

<div>

### [MAHMUD OF GHAZNA]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Mahmud, whose father had founded a strong kingdom in the mountains towards India just as the Caliphate sank into insignificance on the plains of the Euphrates, continued the work of his predecessor and became as renowned as Alexander and Frederick \[the Great\]. He allowed the Caliphate to be reckoned as a kind of spiritual power, which might well be acknowledged as to some extent to his own advantage; meanwhile he extended his realm on all sides, pressing even into India, with great force and singular success. A most zealous Muslim, he proved himself both tireless and severe in spreading his faith and destroying idolatry. The belief in one God always works to create exaltation in that it directs man back to the oneness of his own innermost being. The nation's prophet stands closer; he demands only adherence and the protocols of devotion and commands the spread of a religion which, like every other, provides scope to the partisan and sectarian mentality for endless interpretations and misinterpretations, all the while remaining at bottom the same.

So plain a worship of God had to come into the harshest opposition with Indian idol worship and incite struggle and reaction -- indeed, bloody wars of attrition -- in which the zeal for destruction and for conversion grew ever more intense through the capture of countless treasures. Monstrous and grimacing images, the hollow bodies of which were found to be stuffed with gold and jewels, were broken down into pieces and when quartered, despatched to deck the various portals of Muslim shrines. Detestable as the Indian monstrosities are even today to every pure sensibility, how []{#Chapter_21.xhtml_page_373}hideous must they have appeared to Muslims with their absence of images.

Here it may not be wholly misplaced to note that the original value of each and every religion can be assessed from its effects only after the course of centuries. The Jewish religion will always diffuse a certain rigid obstinacy though accompanied as well by unrestrained cleverness and lively activity; the Muslim religion never releases its adherent from an oppressive narrowness;^[32](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_32){#Chapter_21.xhtml_chfn32}^ without demanding onerous obligations, it provides him with all that he may desire within its confines and at the same time, by focusing on the future, inculcates and preserves both bravery and religious patriotism.^[33](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_33){#Chapter_21.xhtml_chfn33}^

Indian \[Hindu\] doctrine is by its very nature worthless, since now as then, its many thousands of gods -- not even in any hierarchy indeed, but all of them equally powerful divinities -- merely serve to complicate life's contingencies further, preaching the pointlessness of all passion and fostering the notion that vice is madness as the highest stage of sanctity and bliss.^[34](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_34){#Chapter_21.xhtml_chfn34}^

Even a purer polytheism, like that of the Greeks and Romans, must in the end lose both itself and its adherents on false paths. By contrast, the Christian religion merits the highest praise; its pure and noble origin is efficacious in such a way that after the greatest aberrations in which muddled []{#Chapter_21.xhtml_page_374}man can draw it, it emerges again and again, almost before one knows it, in all its loveable and unmistakable originality, as mission, as brotherhood and fellowship, to revivify man's ethical requirements.

If we approve the zeal of Mahmud the iconoclast, at the same time we grant him the countless treasures he won and revere him above all as the founder of Persian poetry and high culture. Of Persian ancestry himself, he refused to be drawn into the narrowness of the Arabs; indeed, he felt strongly that the finest basis and foundation for religion lay in national identity. This in turn relies on poetry, which transmits the most ancient tales in fabulous images, then bit by bit advances in clarity and conveys the past seamlessly into the present.

We have now arrived in our considerations at the tenth century according to our calendar. Cast a glance at the lofty level of culture which continually permeated the Orient, the exclusive aspect of its religions apart. Here, virtually against the will of weak and obstreperous rulers, the surviving vestiges of Greek and Roman achievement were gathered together along with those of so many brilliant Christians expelled from the Church for their eccentricities, since it too strove for uniformity of belief, as in Islam.

And yet, two great branches of human knowledge and action managed to operate freely!

Medicine was expected to heal the microcosm while astronomy sought to interpret all that with which the heavens menaced or caressed us for the future; the former owed reverence to nature, the latter to mathematics, and so both were well received and maintained.

Under the rule of despots the conduct of business affairs, even with the greatest attention and exactitude, was always hazardous; a member of the chancellery needed as much courage to move within the Divan^[35](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_35){#Chapter_21.xhtml_chfn35}^ as a hero on the battle-[]{#Chapter_21.xhtml_page_375}field; the one was not more certain of seeing his hearth again than the other.

Travelling merchants brought ever new increases in both treasure and useful knowledge; the interior of the territory, from the Euphrates to the Indus, offered a world of objects all its own. A swarm of peoples in conflict with one another, rulers now ousted, now ousting others, underwent astonishing changes from triumph to servitude, from supremacy to servility, before one's very eyes and this prompted thoughtful men to utter the most melancholy reflexions on the dreamlike transience of all earthly things.

It's necessary to have all this, and much more -- on the broadest scale of unending fragmentation and instantaneous recovery -- firmly in view in order to be fair to the poets, and especially the Persian poets, to come. For everyone must admit that the conditions as described were in no sense propitious as a milieu in which a poet might find sustenance, might develop and prosper. We may be permitted then to treat the high merit of the earliest period of Persian poets as somewhat problematic. Even if they cannot be measured against the highest, still they must be read with indulgence and pardoned once they have been read.

### [POET-KINGS]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Many poets gathered at Mahmud's court and were active there -- a figure of some four hundred is mentioned. Since everything in the Orient is hierarchical, and must comply with higher laws, the prince appointed a prince of poets who was supposed to test and judge them and urge each one to work to the measure of his talent. This position was regarded as one of the most illustrious at the court; he was the minister []{#Chapter_22.xhtml_page_376}of all scientific, historical and poetic undertakings. Marks of favour came to his underlings through him and when he accompanied the court, he went with so great a retinue and in such magnificent trappings, that he could easily be mistaken for a vizier.

[]{#Chapter_23.xhtml}

<div>

### [TRADITIONS]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

If a person thinks about events of concern primarily to himself with an eye to leaving a report of them behind for future generations, there arises a certain sense of complacent enjoyment in the present, along with a feeling of its great value. At first he fixes in his memory what he took from his fore- fathers and he passes this on in fabulous wrappings; for oral tradition always turns into a fairy tale. With the invention of writing, however, the sheer bliss of writing grips one people after another and so there emerge chronicles which preserve a poetic rhythm long after the poetry which draws on the power of imagination and feeling has vanished. The later periods present us with extensive memorials, autobiographies under varied forms.

In the Orient too we find quite early documents, telling in their cultured worldliness. Our own sacred scriptures may have been composed in writing at a later date and yet, the traditions which prompted this are extremely ancient and cannot be considered appreciatively enough. How much, not only in the Middle East (as we may term Persia and its environs), has come into being at that moment and been preserved, despite all devastation and fragmentation.^[36](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_36){#Chapter_23.xhtml_chfn36}^

If it's beneficial for more intensive cultivation of huge tracts of land not to be subject to a single master but parcelled []{#Chapter_23.xhtml_page_377}out among several, the same circumstance is helpful to preservation since whatever perishes in one place can be carried forward in another, whatever is banished from this spot can take refuge in that one.

In just this fashion, notwithstanding destruction and despoilment, many copies from earlier times must have been preserved, in part copied over from one age to the next and in part remade anew. Thus, we discover that under Yazdegird, the last Sasanian, an imperial history was composed, probably assembled out of old chronicles, of the sort that Ahasuerus in the Book of Esther had read aloud to him during sleepless nights.^[37](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_37){#Chapter_23.xhtml_chfn37}^ Copies of that work, entitled *Bustan-nameh*, still survived. Four hundred years later, under Mansur I of the Samanid dynasty, a reworking of it was undertaken which, however, remained unfinished; the dynasty itself was gobbled up by the Ghaznavids.^[38](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_38){#Chapter_23.xhtml_chfn38}^ Mahmud, the second Ghaznavid ruler, was motivated by the same drive and parcelled out the seven sections of the *Bustan-nameh* among seven court poets. Ansari was the most successful in satisfying his master; he was named King of Poets and commissioned to rework the entire book. He was indolent and clever enough to delay the project, however, and contented himself with poking around on the sly to find somebody else to take over the work.

[]{#Chapter_24.xhtml}

<div>

### [FIRDOWSI (DIED 1030)]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

The important period of Persian poetry which we have now reached offers us the opportunity to observe how momentous events in the world develop only when certain tendencies, notions and intentions, individually sprinkled here and []{#Chapter_24.xhtml_page_378}there, quite without context, bestir themselves and silently spread until sooner or later they finally emerge fully combined to broad effect. In this respect it's remarkable enough that just at the same time that a mighty prince proposes to restore the literature of a people and its lineage, the son of a gardener from Tus makes a copy of the *Bustan-nameh* very much his own and dedicates his great natural talent fervently to such studies.

Intending to lodge a complaint against a local governor because of some hardship, he betakes himself to court, makes vain exertions for a long spell to get access to Ansari through whom his goal could be obtained if he could but call on him. At long last a profound and felicitous couplet, delivered from a staircase, brings him to the attention of the King of Poets who believing in his talent recommends him and secures a commission for him to undertake the great work. Firdowsi starts the *Shah-nameh* under favourable conditions; in the beginning he receives generally adequate remuneration but after thirty years of toil, the royal recompense scarcely matches his expectations. Embittered he quits the court and dies just as the king remembers him favourably once again. Mahmud survives him by hardly a year during which interval old Asadi, Firdowsi's master, finishes writing the *Shah-nameh*.^[39](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_39){#Chapter_24.xhtml_chfn39}^

This work is a weighty, solemn, mythical and historical foundation for a nation; through it, the origins and existence and deeds of the old heroes are preserved. It deals with the earlier and the more recent past, so that while the genuinely historical element finally predominates, the older tales nevertheless transmit much that is true, veiled in primeval tradition.

Firdowsi appears to have been eminently suited for such a work, all the more so in that he held passionately to what was old and truly representative of his nation, and he even []{#Chapter_24.xhtml_page_379}sought to achieve an early purity and strength with respect to language: he excluded Arabic words and took pains to pay careful attention to old Pahlavi.

[]{#Chapter_25.xhtml}

<div>

### [ANVARI ([DIED]{.small} 1152)^[40](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_40){#Chapter_25.xhtml_chfn40}^]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

He studies in Tus, a city famed on account of its imposing seats of learning and indeed, even suspected of over-refinement. As he is sitting at the gate of the college, he spots a great man riding by with his retinue and pomp; when he hears to his considerable astonishment that this is a court poet, he resolves to arrive at a comparable degree of felicity. The poem by which he won the prince's favour, and which he wrote in a night, has come down to us.

From this and from the other poems which have been made known to us there gazes forth a merry spirit, endowed with unending circumspection and a sharp and happy perspicacity, who is the master of an immeasurable store of themes. He lives in the present moment and just as he went in a flash from being a schoolboy to a courtier, so he becomes a free- wheeling encomiast, discovering that there is no higher craft than to entertain his fellow men through praise. He bedecks princes, viziers, beautiful noblewomen, poets and musicians with his praise; to each of them he applies some lovely flourish from the world's vast supply.

We think it unfair that some have turned the circumstances in which Anvari lived and the use he made of his talent into a transgression so many centuries later.^[41](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_41){#Chapter_25.xhtml_chfn41}^ What would become of the poet if there were not highly placed, powerful, clever, energetic, handsome and skilful men whose []{#Chapter_25.xhtml_page_380}excellent merits he might build upon? He twines about them like the vine on the elm or the ivy on the wall, the better to refresh both his eye and his mind. Shall we chide a jeweller who spends his life turning the gemstones of both the Indies into some splendid adornment for an illustrious man? Shall we demand that he take on the occupation -- highly useful, to be sure! -- of a road-mender?

However propitious earth may have been to our poet, the heavens proved catastrophic for him. An \[astrological\] prediction which stirred up the populace, to the effect that on a certain day a tremendous storm would devastate the land, failed to materialise, and not even chess^[42](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_42){#Chapter_25.xhtml_chfn42}^ itself could save its darling from the universal indignation of both the court and the city. He fled. Even in a remote province, only the resolute character of a friendly governor protected him.

Still, the honour of astrology can be rescued if it is supposed that the conjunction of so many planets in a single sign pointed to the future and to Genghis Khan, who wreaked greater devastation in Persia than any mere storm might have done.

[]{#Chapter_26.xhtml}

### [NIZAMI ([DIED]{.small} 1180)]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

A tender, highly gifted spirit who -- since Firdowsi had exhausted all the heroic traditions -- now chose the loveliest fluctuations of the deepest love as the very stuff of his poems. Majnun and Layla, Chosroes and Shirin, couples in love, are what he presents: destined for one another through presentiment, fate, nature, custom, inclination and passion, and strongly drawn to each other, they are separated by a whim or sheer stubbornness, by chance or necessity or duress, only to be somehow wondrously reunited and then, in the end, somehow or other, once again torn apart and separated.

Out of such material and its treatment the stirrings of an []{#Chapter_26.xhtml_page_381}idealised longing awaken. For us, satisfaction is nowhere to be found. The charm is huge, the variety unending.

Even in those other poems of his which are given over to straightforward moralising, there is the same breath of gracious clarity. Whatever ambiguities may confront human beings, he always heads directly back to the practical side of things and discovers that the best solution to all puzzles lies in ethical conduct.

He led a tranquil life in keeping with his tranquil spirit among the Seljuqs^[43](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_43){#Chapter_26.xhtml_chfn43}^ and was buried in his hometown of Ganja.^[44](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_44){#Chapter_26.xhtml_chfn44}^

[]{#Chapter_27.xhtml}

<div>

### [JALAL AL-DIN RUMI ([DIED]{.small} 1262)]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

He accompanies his father who is moving away from Balkh,^[45](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_45){#Chapter_27.xhtml_chfn45}^ due to some unpleasantness with the Sultan, on the pilgrimage. On the way to Mecca they meet ‛Attar, who gives a book of divine secrets^[46](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_46){#Chapter_27.xhtml_chfn46}^ to the youth and fires him up for sacred studies.

Much is noteworthy here: that the true poet is summoned to assimilate within himself the world's majesty and thus is always more inclined to praise than to blame. From this it follows that he sets out in search of the worthiest object and once he has gone through all of them, finally turns his talent above all to praise and glorification of God. This need is dear to the heart of an Oriental since he is ever striving for gushing exuberance and believes to perceive this in contemplation []{#Chapter_27.xhtml_page_382}of the Godhead in its greatest magnitude; in that endeavour no one may accuse him of exaggeration.

Even the so-called Muslim rosary, through which the name of Allah is glorified in ninety-nine attributes, is just such a litany of praise and adoration. Attributes both affirming and denying denote the most ungraspable of beings; the worshipper is amazed, he yields and finds peace. And if the worldly poet employs those perfections which hover across his mind for eminent persons, the man who has surrendered to God takes refuge in that impersonal being which permeates everything from all eternity.

So ‛Attar fled from the court to contemplation and Jalal al- Din, a pure young man, who also kept his distance from princes and capitals, was all the readier to be fired to deeper studies.

After performing the pilgrimage, he travels with his father through Asia Minor and settles at Iconium.^[47](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_47){#Chapter_27.xhtml_chfn47}^ There they teach, are persecuted, banished, once again restored, and there they lie buried alongside their most faithful pupils. Genghis Khan had conquered Persia in the interim but without touching the peaceful place where they sojourned.^[48](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_48){#Chapter_27.xhtml_chfn48}^

In the light of this account no one will hold it against this great spirit if he tends to the abstruse. His works do look some- what gaudy; he deals with brief histories, fairy tales, parables, legends, anecdotes, examples and problems, in order to provide access to mysterious teachings of which he himself is unable to provide any clear account. His aim is instruction and uplift but on the whole he seeks to disentangle, if not fulfil, all longing and to show, through the doctrine of Oneness,^[49](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_49){#Chapter_27.xhtml_chfn49}^ that in the end everything sinks into the divine essence and is transfigured.

A native of Shiraz, he studies in Baghdad; as a youth he takes up the precarious life of a dervish because of an unhappy love affair. Having made the pilgrimage to Mecca fifteen times, he reaches India and Asia Minor on his wanderings, even becoming a prisoner of war of the Crusaders in the West. He survives fabulous adventures, and gains a superb knowledge of peoples and places. After thirty years he returns, revises his works and becomes known. He lives in and weaves a vast range of experience and brims with anecdotes, which he embellishes with proverbs and verses. His firm purpose is to edify his readers and auditors.

He lives well secluded in Shiraz to the age of 102 and is buried there. The successors of Genghis had made Iran a kingdom in its own right where it was possible to dwell in peace.

### [HAFIZ ([DIED]{.small} 1389)]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Whoever still remembers from the last half of the previous century how amongst the Protestants of Germany not only clerics but also laymen could be found who had familiarised themselves with the Holy Scriptures so well that like living concordances, they were trained to provide a reference and context for all biblical verses and who, moreover, knew the principal passages by heart and kept them constantly on hand for any sort of application -- whoever recalls this will also acknowledge that such men inevitably acquired considerable culture since their memories, occupied unceasingly with worthy objects, retained in their sensibility and judgment pure matter for both pleasure and use. They were termed 'well-versed' \[*bibelfest*\] and the designation conferred exceptional worth and unequivocal approbation.

What arose among us Christians out of natural disposition and good will was an obligation for Muslims; for while []{#Chapter_29.xhtml_page_384}it redounded to the greatest credit of such a fellow believer to produce multiple copies of the Qur'an, or to have copies produced, it was no less meritorious to learn the scripture by heart, so as to be able to adduce apt passages on every occasion, to promote moral uplift and to smooth over conflicts. Such people were given the honorary title of *Hafiz* and this has remained the chief name which distinguishes our poet.

Now, to be sure, virtually from its very beginnings, the Qur'an as an object of the most unending interpretations provided an opportunity for exceedingly picayune subtleties; just because it aroused in everybody a need to make sense of it, vastly diverging opinions and demented conjectures -- indeed, the most irrational connections of every sort -- were sought, with the result that the genuinely intelligent and reasonable man had to bestir himself with great zeal simply to get back to the solid ground of the uncontaminated original text. This then is why, in the history of Islam too, we come across interpretations, applications and usages which are often astounding.

The finest poetic talent was trained and formed to just such agility; he knew the Qur'an entire and the religious edifice founded upon it was no mystery to him. He himself says:

::: top
Through the Qur'an have I done

Everything which has come to me.
:::

As a dervish, Sufi and sheikh he taught in Shiraz, his birth-place, to which he confined himself, well liked and cherished by the Muzaffar family and its connections. He occupied himself with theological and grammatical projects, gathering a large number of students about him.

His poems stand in utter contradiction to such solemn studies and an actual teaching position, but this can be resolved by noting that a poet is not obliged to think and to live what he expresses, least of all when he falls in a later period into ticklish circumstances; when he comes close to []{#Chapter_29.xhtml_page_385}rhetorical dissimulation and presents what his contemporaries prefer to hear. This seems to us to have been consistently the case with Hafiz. For just as a teller of fairy tales doesn't believe in the enchantments which he represents but works only to animate them as best he can and stage them so that his auditors are swept away, even less does the lyric poet have to practise everything with which he diverts and cajoles readers and singers both high and low. Moreover, our poet seems not to have set great store by the songs which flowed so easily from him, for only after his death were they collected by his students.

We shall speak little of these poems for one should enjoy them and so arrive at some sense of unison with them. A measured, ever upwelling liveliness streams from them. Clever and gay in narrow circumstances and yet sharing in the fullness of the world, gazing from afar into the mysteries of the godhead but also refusing both religious practice and sensual pleasure -- the one as well as the other -- how utterly this kind of poetic art, whatever it may appear to promote and to teach, must maintain a nimble scepticism from beginning to end.

Jami reaps the full harvest of the foregoing concerns and sums up the culture in its religious, philosophical, scientific aspects, as well as in its prose and poetry. He has the great advantage of being born twenty-three years after the death of Hafiz and of finding the whole field spread open before him even as a youth. The greatest clarity and level-headedness are his salient characteristics. He undertakes and accomplishes everything; he seems at once sensuous and transcendent. The splendours of the real world and of the poet's world lie before him and he moves between them with ease. Mysticism cannot hold much charm for him but without it he could not complete the circle of the national interest and so he provides []{#Chapter_30.xhtml_page_386}a historical account of the crazy antics through which step by step the person hemmed in by his earthly nature can draw close to the Godhead and at the last believe himself to be united with it; but at the last, only unnatural and irrational, ghastly figures come into view.^[50](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_50){#Chapter_30.xhtml_chfn50}^ For what else does the mystic do but slip past problems or shove them aside, if that can be accomplished?

### [OVERVIEW]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

The conclusion might be drawn, on the analogy of the very neatly ordered sequence of the first seven Roman kings, that the history we've set in place here has been cunningly and quite intentionally fabricated; against this, however, it should be noted that the seven poets who are considered the earliest by the Persians, and who gradually appear within a time- frame of five hundred years, really have an ethical and poetical relationship with one another, which might appear concocted if the works they left behind did not bear witness to its actual existence.

Still, if we consider these Pleiades more closely, insofar as it's possible for us at so great a distance, we find that all seven of them possessed a capacious talent, ever freshly reinventing itself, by which they deemed themselves to be exalted above the small number of outstanding men as well as the larger mass of middling and pedestrian talents; yet, by the same token, they ended up situated as they were in a particular time and place, in which they could happily realise a huge windfall and blunt the impact of their equally talented successors for a long time to come, until an age again appeared []{#Chapter_31.xhtml_page_387}in which nature could once again open up new treasures to poets.

With this in mind, let us take the poets we've considered once again individually and observe that:

*Firdowsi* seized all the past events of the state and empire, whether historical or fabulous, so utterly that nothing remained for a successor other than allusion and annotation, not new treatment or re-imagining.

*Anvari* took his stand in the present. Brilliant and splendid, as nature appeared to him, he gazed, joyously gifted, at the court of his Shah; to string the two worlds -- this one and the next -- together in their most exquisite features, and to do so in the choicest of words, was both his duty and his delight. No one has ever done it better than he.

*Nizami* seized hold of all the legends of love and wonder-working which lay before him with the force of affection. The Qur'an had already shown how the most ancient, the most laconic traditions might be handled and treated to one's own specific purposes and made entertaining.

*Jalal al-Din Rumi* feels uneasy on the problematic ground of reality; he yearns to solve the puzzles of inward and outward phenomena by witty and spiritual means, with the result that his own works stand in need of new riddles, new solutions and commentaries. He finds himself at the last constrained to take refuge in the doctrine of Oneness of Being by which as much is lost as is gained and in the end nothing remains but a zero, as comforting as it is comfortless. How then could any communication in either poetry or prose succeed beyond this? Fortunately,

*Sa‛di*, that excellent man, is expelled into the larger world and swamped with the numberless little facts experience accords, from all of which he is astute enough to draw something of use. He feels the need to concentrate and collect himself; he is convinced that he has an obligation to instruct others and in this way, he has become eminently profitable and beneficial for Westerners like ourselves.

[]{#Chapter_31.xhtml_page_388}*Hafiz*, a blithe and mighty talent, content to decline everything which human beings most crave, to set aside all that they may not dispense with, and in this way he ever appears as the merry brother of his fellow man. He can be acknowledged justly only within the sphere of his own time and place. But as soon as one has seized hold of him, he becomes a lovable life's companion. Even today, camel and mule-drivers still sing him out, hardly knowing who he is, not because of the meaning of his verses, which he himself has chopped to bits, but for the sake of the mood he forever diffuses so purely and freshly.^[51](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_51){#Chapter_31.xhtml_chfn51}^ Who could then succeed this poet when all else had been already taken by his predecessors? But then

*Jami*, equal to everything that had occurred before him and around him, wound this all together into sheaves, imitated, renewed, extended, united within himself all the merits as well as the shortcomings of his predecessors with the greatest lucidity, and he did so in such a way that to a succeeding age nothing remained possible other than to be like him, unless it were to be worse; and thus it remained for yet another three centuries. In this respect we note only that if the drama might have broken through at some point and a poet of this sort arisen, the whole course of literature might have taken another direction.^[52](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_52){#Chapter_31.xhtml_chfn52}^

If we have ventured to describe five hundred years of the Persian art of poetry and eloquence within this small compass, let it be -- to draw on the words of Quintilian, our []{#Chapter_31.xhtml_page_389}ancient master -- accepted by our friends as rounded numbers are permitted, not for the sake of more exact determination, but in order that we may express something general in an approximate and rather easygoing fashion.

[]{#Chapter_32.xhtml}

### [MISCELLANEOUS]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

The fecundity and the variety of the Persian poets spring from the incalculable breadth of the outside world and its unending abundance. A public life, constantly agitated, in which all objects have equal weight, wavers before us with all the force of our imagination, and for this reason their similes so often impress us as showy and grating. Impulsively they string together the noblest and the basest images, a procedure which we find not so easy to become accustomed to.

Nevertheless, let us state it candidly: a man of the world, a man who breathes freedom of action, possesses neither aesthetic feeling nor taste; for him reality suffices in his dealings, his enjoyments, his consideration, and so too in poetry. So if the Oriental conjoins absurdities for the purpose of producing an unusual effect,^[53](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_53){#Chapter_32.xhtml_chfn53}^ the German, in similar circumstances, shouldn't look askance.

The confusion which arises in the imagination from such productions is comparable to what we feel when strolling through an eastern bazaar or a European market fair. The priciest and the cheapest goods aren't always so far apart, they're jumbled together before us and we often note the casks and trunks and sacks in which they're carried too. Just as at a fruit and vegetable market we don't see solely herbs, roots and fruits but all sorts of peelings, husks and stalks scattered about.

The oriental poet thinks it easy as pie to whisk us from []{#Chapter_32.xhtml_page_390}earth to heaven and from there back down again, or the reverse. Nizami knows just how to coax an ethical precept out of the stinking carcass of a dog to edify and astonish us:

::: top
Lord Jesus wandering through the world

Once went through a marketplace.

A dead dog lay across the path,

Dragged in front of the door of a house;

A crowd was gathered around the carcass

The way vultures collect at carrion \[*Äser*\].

One said, My brain is quite

Annihilated by this stink.

Another piped up: It doesn't take much

For the scourings of graves to bring bad luck.

Thus each one spoke in his way

To badmouth the dead dog's corpse.

But when it was Jesus's turn to speak

He spoke good sense without abuse,

He spoke from the goodness of his being:

'The teeth are white as pearls.'

His words made all those who stood about

Feel hot with shame like shells that fire burns through.^[54](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_54){#Chapter_32.xhtml_chfn54}^
:::

Everyone feels touched when the prophet, as lovable as he is astute, offers compassion and leniency in his own inimitable way. How powerfully he manages to bring the unruly crowd back to itself, to make it feel shame for its rejection and abuse, brings it to consider this disregarded excellence with acknowledgement, perhaps even with envy! For now everyone present thinks about his own teeth! Beautiful teeth everywhere, but especially in the East, are seen as a supremely attractive gift from God Himself. A putrefying creature becomes an object of admiration and the most devout []{#Chapter_32.xhtml_page_391}consideration because of the single perfection which remains to it.

But the superb simile with which the parable concludes isn't quite so clear and forceful to us, and so we shall take the trouble to make it vivid.

In regions where limestone deposits are scarce, sea shells are used in the preparation of a much-needed building material and, layered between dry brushwood, they are set aglow with lively flame. The onlooker cannot avoid the feeling that these beings, alive in the sea, feeding and growing, not so long ago still savouring, in their own way, the universal delight in existence, are now not so much consumed by fire as transfused by its glow and attain their perfected form, even when all trace of life has been expelled. Suppose further that night has fallen and that these organic remains appear to be actually shining to the observer's eye -- no more magnificent image of a deep and secret torment of the soul could be presented to the eye. Anyone who wishes to have a full glimpse of this should ask a chemist to bring oyster shells to a state of phosphorescence whereupon he will concede with us that the scalding hot sensation which pierces a man whenever a justified reproach strikes him unexpectedly in the midst of his own myopic self-regard, could not be expressed more fearsomely than this.

Such comparisons, hundreds of which might be adduced, depend upon the most immediate scrutiny of the natural and the real but at the same time they also awaken a lofty ethical sentiment which arises from a sensibility at once fresh and refined in its very foundations.

Within this unbounded breadth \[of subject matter\], the attention to individual detail, the keen but loving glance which strives to tease out the most characteristic aspects of a meaningful object, is pre-eminently valuable. Thus there are poetical 'still lifes' which could be set beside the works of the best Dutch artists and indeed, may be deemed superior in their ethical aspect. Precisely because of this inclination, []{#Chapter_32.xhtml_page_392}this capability, they can never relinquish certain much-loved objects; no Persian poet ever tires of portraying the lamp that dazzles or the candle that glows. This is the cause of the monotony which some people reproach this poetry for. And yet, considered rightly, these natural things stand as surrogates for mythology; the rose and the nightingale occupy the place of Apollo and Daphne. If one keeps in mind all that was missing for them -- that they had no theatre, no plastic arts -- and that their poetic talent was, however, no less than anyone else's before or since, so must one who is warmly disposed to their innermost world admire them even more.

[]{#Chapter_33.xhtml}

<div>

### [VERY MISCELLANEOUS]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

The loftiest aspect of Oriental poetic art is what we Germans call *Geist*,^[55](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_55){#Chapter_33.xhtml_chfn55}^ pre-eminent among the higher directive faculties; all other qualities are united here without any single one asserting some intrinsic right to predominate. *Geist* belongs especially to old age or to an aging epoch. In all the poets of the East we discover a broad view of the world as it is, irony and talent given free scope. Premise and conclusion are offered us simultaneously and because of that we see too how much greater value is set upon impromptu speech. All the poets have all objects present and draw the remotest things lightly together, so that they also approach what we term 'wit'. Nevertheless, wit doesn't enjoy such esteem for it is self-seeking and pleased with itself -- traits *Geist* is free from, for which reason it can -- and indeed, must -- everywhere be called 'genial',^[56](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_56){#Chapter_33.xhtml_chfn56}^ touched by genius.

But the poet doesn't rejoice in such accomplishments all by himself; the nation as a whole is rich in wit, as countless []{#Chapter_33.xhtml_page_393}anecdotes make clear. Through a brilliant word the prince's fury is aroused, through another word appeased. Passion and propensity live and move in the self-same element; thus do Bahram Gur and Dilaram invent rhyme while Jamil and Buthayna remain passionately linked into high old age.^[57](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_57){#Chapter_33.xhtml_chfn57}^ The entire history of Persian poetry swarms with similar instances.

If one considers that Anushirwan, one of the last Sasanians, had the *Fables* of Bidpai together with chess brought at immense cost from India around the very time of Muhammad, then the condition of such an age stands fully expressed. To judge from what has been passed down to us, each person outdoes another in worldly wisdom and in independent views of earthly matters. For this reason, even four centuries later, in the first and finest epoch of Persian poetry, no wholly pure, no completely naïve freshness could come to be. The great measure of circumspection demanded of the poet, together with the upsurge of learning and the circumstances of both court and battlefield, all required the utmost thoughtfulness.

[]{#Chapter_34.xhtml}

<div>

### [NEWER, NEWEST]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Following the manner of Jami and his era, later poets mixed poetry and prose more and more, so that a single style was employed for all kinds of writing. History, poetry, philosophy, chancery documents and correspondence were all executed in the same way, and so it has continued for three centuries now. Happily we're in a position to present an example of the newest style of all.

When the Persian ambassador Mirza Abu al-Hasan Khan was in St Petersburg, he was asked for a few lines in his own []{#Chapter_34.xhtml_page_394}hand.^[58](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_58){#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn58}^ He was amiable enough to write a page which we include here in translation:

::: top
I have travelled in the whole world, I have associated with many people, every nook offered me something of use, every blade of grass a spike of grain, but even so, I've seen no place comparable to this city or its lovely houris. May God's blessing remain upon it forever!

How well did that merchant speak who fell amongst robbers all aiming their arrows at him:[59](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_59){#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn59} 'A king who suppresses trade seals the gates of salvation in his army's face. What rational person could wish to visit his land, given its reputation for injustice? If you want to acquire a good name, treat merchants and envoys with respect. Great men treat travellers well in order to gain high renown. The country which does not shelter strangers soon perishes. Be a friend to strangers and travellers, since they should be considered the means to good reputation; be hospitable, cherish those who are passing through, guard against being unjust to them. He who observes this counsel of an envoy will surely draw advantage from it.'

It is related that ῾Umar ibn ῾Abd al-῾Aziz^[60](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_60){#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn60}^ was a mighty king but at night, in his little chamber, he spoke in utter humility and lowliness, and turning his countenance towards the throne of his Creator, he said, 'O Lord! You have entrusted mighty matters to the hand of a weak slave. For the sake of the majesty of the pure and the holy of Your realm, grant me righteousness and []{#Chapter_34.xhtml_page_395}justice, preserve me from human wickedness. I fear that the heart of an innocent man might be troubled because of me and that the curse of the oppressed may lie heavily on my neck. A king should ever be mindful of the sovereignty and existence of the Highest Being, and of the continual mutability of earthly things; he should consider that the crown may pass from a worthy head to an unworthy one and not allow himself to be led by pride. For a king who is arrogant, who despises both friend and neighbour, cannot thrive for long on his throne; no one should let himself become puffed up because of a few days of fame. The world is like a fire that has been kindled along the way; he who takes what he needs to light his path suffers no evil but he who takes more \[than he needs\] gets scorched.'

When Plato was asked how he had lived in this world he replied, 'In pain came I into the world, my life was sustained astonishment, and I leave the world unwillingly, having learned nothing except that I know nothing.' Keep away from him who undertakes something in ignorance and from a pious man who is untutored; both of them may be likened to the ass that turns the millstone without knowing why. A sword is lovely to look upon but its effects are distasteful. A man who is well disposed associates with strangers but the man of evil intentions is estranged from his nearest and dearest. A king said to someone named Buhlul, 'Give me counsel.'^[61](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_61){#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn61}^ He replied, 'Do not envy the cheapskate, nor the unjust judge, nor any wealthy man who knows nothing of household management, nor the magnanimous fellow who needlessly squanders his money, nor the scholar who is lacking in discernment. In this world one acquires either a good name or a bad one; since one can make a choice between the two, and since too []{#Chapter_34.xhtml_page_396}everyone, good or bad, must die, happy is he who prefers the reputation of a virtuous man.'

These lines Mirza Abu al-Hasan Khan, of Shiraz, wrote, in accord with the request of a friend, in the year 1231 of the Hijra, on a day of Jumada al-thani -- May 1816, according to the Christian reckoning -- during his sojourn in the capital St Petersburg, as extraordinary envoy of His Majesty, Fath ῾Ali Shah Qajar, of Persia.^[62](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_62){#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn62}^ He expresses the hope that an ignorant man will be forgiven with indulgence for undertaking to write a few lines.
:::

As it is now clear from the foregoing that a certain kind of poetry and prose has persisted for some three centuries, and the style of personal and business correspondence, both in public and in private, has remained the same, so too do we learn that in more recent times there are still poets at the Persian court who hand on a chronicle of the days -- hence, of all that the emperor undertakes and what then transpires -- composed in verse and handsomely written, to a specially appointed archivist. In the immutable Orient, as this makes clear, since the times of Ahasuerus, who had such chronicles read aloud to him during sleepless nights, no further alteration has taken place.

We note here that such reading aloud occurs with a certain declamation, which is performed with emphases, with rising and falling tones, and must have much in common with the way in which French tragedies are declaimed. This prompts the reflection that the Persian couplet forms a comparable contrast, like the two halves of the alexandrine.

This very persistence may also be the reason that Persians still love, cherish and honour their poems after eight hundred years; we ourselves have witnessed that an Oriental regards and handles a superbly bound and preserved manuscript of the *Masnavi* with as much awe as if it were the Qur'an.

[]{#Chapter_35.xhtml}

<div>

### [[]{#Chapter_35.xhtml_page_397}DOUBT]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Still, Persian poetry, and whatever resembles it, is never accepted by Westerners purely and with complete ease; we have to be enlightened about this if our taste for \[the poetry\] isn't to be abruptly disturbed.

It isn't religion which distances us from this poetry. The oneness of God, surrender to His will, mediation through a prophet, all agree more or less with our faith, our way of conceiving things. Our own sacred scriptures too form a common ground if only in the shape of legends.

We've long since been made familiar with the tales, the fables, parables, anecdotes, witticisms and jokes of that region. Even its mysticism speaks to us and deserves to be compared to our own if only because of its profound and fundamental seriousness -- mysticism which in more recent times expresses, when considered closely, only a vapid and mediocre yearning; it becomes a parody of itself, as this verse demonstrates:

::: top
Eternal thirst will avail me

Only after the thirst.^[63](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_63){#Chapter_35.xhtml_chfn63}^

[]{#Chapter_36.xhtml}

<div>

### [DESPOTISM]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

What can never sit well to a Western mind, however, is the spiritual and physical subjection to lords and higher authorities, which comes down from the earliest times when kings first appeared as standing in for God. In reading the Old Testament we aren't surprised whenever men and women fall on their faces before priests and heroes and entreat them for []{#Chapter_36.xhtml_page_398}they are accustomed to doing much the same thing in the presence of Elohim. What originally took place out of natural pious sentiment changed later into tedious courtly etiquette. The kow-tow, the three-fold bow repeated thrice, comes in here. How many western envoys to eastern courts have come to grief through this ceremony! Persian poetry cannot be well received among us if we are not utterly clear on this matter.

What Westerner can tolerate the fact that the Easterner not only thumps his head nine times on the ground but even goes so far as to toss it away for any old reason whatever?

Polo, in which ball and stick play a large part, is often revived under the gaze of the ruler and the public and indeed, with direct participation on both sides. But when a poet puts his head as the ball on the polo-stick of the Shah, so that the prince will notice him and speed him forth with the polo-stick of favour, then we can't follow, nor do we wish to, either in imagination or in fellow-feeling. Here's how it runs:

::: top
How long will you, without a hand or a foot,

Continue to play Fate's polo ball?

Though you leap over a hundred courses

You cannot evade the polo-stick.

Place your head on the Shah's own course

And maybe he'll yet look at you.
:::

And again:

::: top
That countenance alone

Is Fortune's looking-glass

That was rubbed free of dust

By the hoof of this horse.
:::

It's not only before the Sultan but before the beloved as well that he abases himself just as deeply and even more often:

::: top
[]{#Chapter_36.xhtml_page_399}My face lay on the path,

No footstep passed it by.
:::

\*

In the dust of your pathway,

My pavilion of hope!

The dust from your foot

Is preferable to water!

::: top
\*

He who stomped my bare

Skull into dust with his feet

I shall crown as a king

If only he'll come back to me.
:::

From this it's obvious that one means about as little as the other, initially employed for a worthy occasion but then more and more frequently used and misused. Hence Hafiz can say quite buffoonishly:

::: top
My head shall be

In the dust of the landlord's path.
:::

\*

A deeper study might perhaps confirm the suspicion that the earlier poets traded more modestly in these conceits and only later poets, treading the same arena in the same language, in the end took such misuses less in earnest than in parody until the tropes dropped finally away from their objects such that no relationship could be either conceived or felt.

And so we conclude with the lovely lines of Anvari, as graceful as they are deft, which honour a worthy poet of his own time:

::: top
[]{#Chapter_36.xhtml_page_400}To the wise, Shuja‛i's poems are enticing lures.

Hundreds of birds flutter hungrily about them, as do I.

Go, my poem, kiss the earth at this lord's feet and say:

You, time's virtue, are yourself an entire epoch of virtue.^[64](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_64){#Chapter_36.xhtml_chfn64}^

<div>

### [OBJECTION]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

In order to clarify somewhat the relation of the despots to their subjects and what human element there may yet be in that relation, as well as perhaps to set our minds a bit at rest regarding the servile conduct of their poets, one or two passages may be interpolated here which offer testimony as to how those who know both history and the world have judged this. A thoughtful Englishman expresses himself as follows:^[65](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_65){#Chapter_37.xhtml_chfn65}^

::: top
...that absolute power which is, in Europe, softened by the usages and the knowledge of a civilised age into a moderate government, has, amongst the nations of Asia, always the same character, and nearly the same course. The few shades of distinction which do exist, depend chiefly upon the personal disposition and power of the despot; and often more upon the latter than on the former: for no country can be happy or prosperous which is exposed to continual war; and that appears, from the earliest period, to have been the state of every eastern kingdom, the sovereign of which was not powerful. It follows, that the greatest happiness which the mass of the population can obtain under such a government must have its source in the power and fame of the monarch, and the comparative blessings which his subjects enjoy form the substantial ground of their pride in []{#Chapter_37.xhtml_page_401}such rulers. We must not, therefore, solely refer to base and venal motives, that flattery which they bestow on them. Insensible to the value of liberty, and ignorant of all other forms of government, they naturally prize that state of their own in which they find they have most security and enjoyment: and they are not only content, but proud to humble themselves before one exalted man, when they see, in the magnitude of his power, a certain refuge against more intolerable and oppressive rules.
:::

So too, an intelligent and knowledgeable German reviewer says:^[66](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_66){#Chapter_37.xhtml_chfn66}^

::: top
The author, himself an admirer of the lofty flights of the panegyrists of this period, nevertheless rightly faults the noble minds squandering their power in an excess of encomia as well as the debasement of character which usually follows as a consequence. But it must be noted too that in the artistic edifice of a truly poetic people, decked out in manifold adornments of rich achievement, panegyric poetry is as essential as satiric, to which it forms merely a counterpart, and its dissolution leads straightaway into either moralistic poetry -- that unruffled judge of human virtues and failings and guide to the final goal of inmost tranquillity -- or into the epic, which with impartial audacity sets the highest human excellence alongside life's sheer ordinariness -- no longer as something to be rebuked but as contributing to the whole -- and reconciles both extremes and unites them in a single pure image of existence itself. If it befits human nature, and is a sign of its higher origin, that it seizes enthusiastically upon what is noble in human endeavour []{#Chapter_37.xhtml_page_402}and its higher perfection, and by contemplating this simultaneously renews its inner life, then the praise of power and might, as it shows itself in princes, is also a splendid phenomenon in the realm of poetry, and it has fallen into disrepute among us -- and quite rightly so -- simply because those who devoted themselves to it have been for the most part not poets but merely money-grubbing sycophants. And yet, who, hearing Calderon praise his king, when the boldest surge of fantasy sweeps him away, can think of praise put up for sale? Or who might gird his heart against Pindar's victory hymns? If the despotic nature of Persia's crown had its counterpart at that time in a shared adoration of power amongst the majority of those who sang the praises of princes, even so, through the conception of enlightened power which it engendered in noble spirits it inspired many poems worthy of posterity's admiration as well. And just as the poets are still worthy of this admiration today, so too are those princes through whom we discover a genuine acknowledgement of human dignity as well as a passion for the art which celebrates their memory. Anvari, Khaqani, Zahir Faryabi and Achestegi are the poets of this period in the field of panegyric whose works are still read with delight in the Orient so that their noble names still stand proof against any disparagement.^[67](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_67){#Chapter_37.xhtml_chfn67}^ A proof of how close the striving of the panegyric poet borders on the highest demand which can be made of a human being lies in the sudden shift of one of these poets, Sana'i, to religious poetry: now, after he has learned to locate a sense of the supremely Exalted -- which he was once happy enough to seek in life -- far beyond this []{#Chapter_37.xhtml_page_403}sphere of existence, he turns from being a panegyrist of his prince into an impassioned singer of God alone and His eternal perfection.

### [ADDENDUM]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

These reflections of two serious and thoughtful men will incline us towards leniency in passing judgement on Persian poets and encomiasts while at the same time confirming what we stated earlier: namely, that in a perilous time, everything in government depends on whether a prince not only protects those who are beneath him but is also capable of leading them in person against the foe. Ancient examples can be adduced for this truth which is constantly being confirmed up to the present day; as when we cite the fundamental principle of rule which God imparted to the Israelites, to their general approval, at the very moment when they asked once and for all to have a king over themselves. This 'constitution', which certainly seems pretty odd to us nowadays, we here set down verbatim:^[68](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_68){#Chapter_38.xhtml_chfn68}^

::: top
And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king. And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his []{#Chapter_38.xhtml_page_404}servants. And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
:::

When Samuel now tries to impress on his people the dubious nature of such a covenant and to dissuade them from it, they cry out with one voice:

::: top
Nay; but we will have a king over us; That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
:::

It is in just this sense that the Persian says:

::: top
With word and sword he compasses and safeguards the land;

But he who compasses and safeguards is himself held in God's hand.^[69](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_69){#Chapter_38.xhtml_chfn69}^
:::

In forming judgement on various forms of rule there's a general tendency not to pay enough attention to the fact that in all of them, whatever they may be called, freedom and servitude exist as simultaneous extremes. If power is in the hands of a single man, the populace is servile; if power is in the hands of the many, the single man is at a disadvantage; moreover, this fluctuation continues at every stage until a []{#Chapter_38.xhtml_page_405}balance, short-lived as it must be, is struck somewhere. This is no secret to the historian; and yet, no one can see this with any clarity amid life's tumultuous moments. Never is there more talk of freedom than when one party wants to subdue another and then nothing further is considered except that power, influence and property pass from one hand to another. Freedom is the softly spoken watchword of those who break their promises in secret, the loudly bellowed battle cry of open revolutionaries; indeed, it is the buzz-word of despotism itself in leading its oppressed masses against the foe while holding out the promise of freedom for all time from foreign domination.

[]{#Chapter_39.xhtml}

<div>

### [COUNTER-ACTION]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

And yet, not to give in to such a generally slanted view, we prefer to travel back to the Orient and observe how human nature, ever unconquerable, resists pressure from outside; and so we discover that the free and stubborn sense of self of individuals everywhere forms a counterweight to the all-powerful One; they may be slaves but they are not subjugated, they permit themselves incomparable audacities. To adduce an example from more ancient times let's proceed to an evening banquet in the tent of Alexander where we come upon him in lively, vehement, indeed boisterous colloquy with one of his own.

Cleitus, Alexander's foster brother, his companion in war and in play, loses two brothers on the battlefield, saves the king's life, appears as a general of note, the loyal governor of important provinces. He cannot go along with the divine status arrogated by the king; he has witnessed his advance, he has known him needy of both service and aid; he may even cultivate an aversion, born of bitterness, to overestimating his achievements.

The table talk at Alexander's festive board may always []{#Chapter_39.xhtml_page_406}have been quite significant; his guests were all accomplished and cultured men, all of them born at a period when eloquence in Greece was at its height. It was customary to propose, choose or quite accidentally hit upon weighty problems and to bat these back and forth in a consciously sophistical and rhetorical fashion. But then when someone rose in defence of the party to which he himself was attached, drunkenness and passion mounted by turns and in the end it had to result in violent scenes. It is along just such lines that we come upon the suspicion that the conflagration of Persepolis didn't come to pass simply out of coarse daft braggadocio^[70](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_70){#Chapter_39.xhtml_chfn70}^ but rather was kindled at just such a dinner-table exchange, in which one party argued that one ought to spare the Persians since they'd already been conquered, while the other, by contrast, bringing the remorseless behaviour of the Asians in destroying Greek temples once again before the company's eyes and intensifying the madness in a drunken rage, reduced the old royal monuments to ashes. The fact that women took part -- and they are always the fiercest and most implacable enemies of their enemies -- renders our suspicion even more likely.

Nevertheless, should anyone remain a bit dubious on this subject, we're all the more certain about what occasioned the fatal schism at the banquet which we mentioned earlier; history preserves it for us. To wit, that it was the conflict, perennially repeated, between youth and age. The elders, on whose side Cleitus argued, could refer to a consistent sequence of deeds which they had carried out tirelessly, with both strength and wisdom, in fidelity to the king, the country and the goal proposed. The young, on the other hand, took it as a given that all that had occurred, that much had been accomplished and that they stood at that moment at the borders of India; and yet, that brought to mind how much yet remained to be accomplished, comparable deeds waited to be performed and with the promise of a glittering future they []{#Chapter_39.xhtml_page_407}thought to obscure the glory of past achievements. That the king took this side is natural enough for there could be no question of past action in his case. Cleitus, by contrast, revealed his secret indignation and in the king's presence, he repeated malicious remarks which had earlier come to the prince's notice as things spoken behind his back. Amazingly, Alexander maintained his composure but, alas, a bit too long. Cleitus overstepped the limit in fractious comment until the king leapt to his feet; at first those nearest him restrained him and took Cleitus aside. But Cleitus came back raging with fresh calumnies and Alexander, seizing a spear from a guard, struck him down.^[71](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_71){#Chapter_39.xhtml_chfn71}^

What next transpired doesn't really belong here; we note only that the bitterest lament of the despairing king consisted of the observation that in future he would live alone like a beast in the forest since henceforth nobody would dare to utter a free word in his presence. This remark, whether it's the king's or the historian's, confirms what we suspected earlier.

In the previous century it was still possible for a person to contradict the Persian emperor at festive meals, and to do so unabashedly -- though, to be sure, the dinner companion who was overly bold would be dragged away by the feet and as he was hauled past him the monarch might be asked whether he might just possibly pardon him? If not, then out with him, and beaten to a pulp!

Just how boundlessly stubborn and refractory favourites could behave against the emperor has been reported to us by credible historians and handed down in anecdotes. The ruler is like fate, relentless, and yet he inspires defiance. In the face of this, strong natures sink into a kind of madness, the most amazing instances of which could be presented.

Even so, temperate, firm, consistent natures subordinate []{#Chapter_39.xhtml_page_408}themselves to the supreme power, from which everything cascades -- benefit as well as suffering -- so that they may live and act as they wish. But the poet who values his talent has to dedicate himself to the first, and Highest, cause. At court, in converse with the great, he finds that a perspective on the world opens wide to him and he needs this to get to the rich abundance of all subjects. Here lies not merely the excuse but the justification for the flattery, which is appropriate for the panegyrist who practises his craft at its best when he is laden with a profusion of sheer stuff with which to deck out princes and viziers, maidens and youths, prophets and saints, indeed, the Godhead itself, in brimmingly human fashion.

We too praise our Western poet when he heaps up a whole world of frippery and finery^[72](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_72){#Chapter_39.xhtml_chfn72}^ to glorify the image of his beloved.^[73](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_73){#Chapter_39.xhtml_chfn73}^

### [INTERPOLATED]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

The circumspection of the poet addresses itself really to form, the world gives him the stuff all too generously, the content springs on its own out of the fullness inside him; both come together unconsciously and at the end no one can tell to whom the riches truly belong.

Form, however, though it lies above all in the genius, needs to be known and considered, and here caution is required, so that form, matter and content correspond to one another, fuse together and interpenetrate.

[]{#Chapter_40.xhtml_page_409}The poet stands far too high to form a party.

### [PRIMAL ELEMENTS OF ORIENTAL POETRY]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

In the Arabic language there are few stems or root-words which do not relate to camels, horses and sheep, if not directly, then by means of a slight twist or shuffle. We really can't call these expressions, drawn originally from nature and from life, 'tropes'. Everything which man naturally and freely utters bears upon his actual life; and the Arab is as deeply attached to camel and horse as the body is to the soul; he encounters nothing whatsoever which does not simultaneously affect these creatures too and bind their being and their actions vitally to his own. If in addition to the aforementioned creatures, the other wild and domestic animals which appear frequently enough to the gaze of the freely wandering Bedouins are taken into account, these too have an impact at every point in their lives. Should you stride out and look at all the rest that's visible -- mountain and desert, cliff and plain, trees, grasses, flowers, river and sea as well as the firmament filled with stars -- you will discover that to the Oriental each thing leads to everything else in his mind, so that, accustomed as he is to weaving together the most distant things, he requires little thought to bring forth one contradiction after another out of the tiniest shift of letter or syllable. From this it is evident that language is productive in and by itself. Indeed, in so far as it meets thought halfway, it is eloquent; in so far as it accords with the imagination, it is poetic.

[]{#Chapter_41.xhtml_page_410}Therefore, he who, starting from the very earliest, most primal figures \[*Ur-Tropen*\], has identified the boldest and freest, until at last he arrives at the most daring, the most capricious -- nay, even the clumsiest, most conventional and hackneyed -- has gained an unimpeded overview of the main pinnacles of Oriental poetry. At the same time, however, he'll be easily persuaded that there can be no question in that literature of what we term 'taste,' that is, of the separation between the decorous and the indecorous. Its virtues cannot be separated from its flaws, they are connected with each other, they emerge one from the other, they must be assessed as they are, with neither quibbles nor carping. Nothing is more insufferable than when Reiske and Michaelis hoist these poets into the high heavens at one moment and then, at the next, treat them like dim-witted schoolboys.^[75](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_75){#Chapter_41.xhtml_chfn75}^

In this regard it's striking to note that the earliest poets who lived amid impressions drawn from the very sources of nature and who formed their language poetically, must have had very considerable advantages; those who arrive in a more self-conscious time, under complicated circumstances, certainly display the same striving but steadily lose track of what is laudable and correct. For when they snatch at figures which are more and more far-fetched, sheer nonsense results and in the end, nothing is left but the broadest conception, under which objects can all be jumbled together, the conception which gazes at all and in so doing, abolishes poetry itself.

[]{#Chapter_42.xhtml}

<div>

### [[]{#Chapter_42.xhtml_page_411}TRANSITION FROM TROPES TO SIMILES]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Since all that's been said so far holds true as well for closely related comparisons, a few examples may serve to confirm our assertion.

The hunter glimpsed waking up in the open field compares the rising sun to a *falcon*:

::: top
Life and action penetrate my breast,

I stand firmly on my own two feet again:

For the golden falcon, on broad pinions,

Hovers above his azure nest.
:::

Or, more splendidly still, to a *lion*:

::: top
The mists of daybreak became bright again,

Heart and mind were all at once made glad

When the night, that shy gazelle,

Fled from the lion of the morning's threat.
:::

How could Marco Polo who witnessed all this, and more, not have been astonished by such comparisons!^[76](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_76){#Chapter_42.xhtml_chfn76}^

We constantly find the poet writing playfully of curls.

::: top
More than fifty baited lines

Stick in every lock of your hair...^[77](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_77){#Chapter_42.xhtml_chfn77}^
:::

is adorably directed at a lovely head with a profusion of locks and the poetic imagination doesn't balk at conceiving of the tips of the hair as little hooks. Still, when the poet says that he is hanged on hairs, this doesn't strike us as quite right. []{#Chapter_42.xhtml_page_412}When it refers to the Sultan,

::: top
In the ribbons of your curls

The enemy's throat is choked,
:::

the imagination is presented with either a repellent image or indeed, none at all.

That we are slain by *eyelashes* may well pass muster, but to be 'speared by eyelashes' cannot appeal to us; moreover, when eyelashes, compared to brooms, sweep the stars down from the sky, this seems a bit too gaudy for us. The *brow* of the beauty as the heart's grindstone; the lover's *heart* as rubble rolled and rounded by torrents of tears; these and similar gambits -- mere wit without much feeling -- oblige us to little more than a friendly smile.

Even so, when the poet treats an opponent in chess as mere tent-paraphernalia, the results can be quite brilliant:

::: top
May you always be splintered like chips! Ripped like rags! Hammered like nails and thrust in like pegs!
:::

In this we glimpse the poet at headquarters; the endlessly repeated setting up of the tents, and striking them down again, hovers before his soul.

From these few examples, which could be multiplied endlessly, it's clear that no boundary can be drawn between what might be termed laudable and what reprehensible in our sense, simply because all their merits are really the products of their faults. Should we wish to share in the productions of the loftiest minds, then we must 'orientalise' ourselves; the Orient won't come calling on us. And even though translations are much to be praised for enticing and guiding us, it must be obvious from all that's been said earlier that in this literature, language as language plays the central role. Who wouldn't want to be familiar with these treasures at their source!

Keeping in mind that poetic technique exerts the greatest []{#Chapter_42.xhtml_page_413}influence on every manner of poetry, and necessarily so, we note here as well that the double-rhymed verse of Orientals promotes a parallelism which, however, tends to disperse rather than concentrate the mind, all the more so in that the rhyme indicates two quite disparate objects.^[78](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_78){#Chapter_42.xhtml_chfn78}^ Because of this their poems display something in the nature of a mish-mash, or prescribe end-rhymes in which, true enough, the most gifted poets were stimulated to achieve the highest excellence. How severe a judgment the nation has imposed in this matter appears from the fact that in five hundred years it has recognised only seven poets as supreme.

[]{#Chapter_43.xhtml}

<div>

### [ADMONITION]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

We might easily invoke everything which we've expressed up till now in well-intentioned witness against oriental poetry. For this reason we make bold to offer men whose truly intimate and direct knowledge of these regions is acknowledged with an admonition consistent with our aim of averting all possible prejudice on so excellent a subject.

Comparisons make it easier for everyone to form a judgment but they make it harder too. For when a comparison is taken too far and falters, a comparative judgment becomes even more inapposite the closer one considers it. We don't mean to overdo this but merely to say in the present instance that whenever the estimable Jones compares oriental poets with Greek and Latin poets, he has his reasons; the connection with England and its scholars of antiquity oblige him to do this. Formed himself in the strict classical school, he is well aware of the exclusionary prejudice that nothing is of any value except for what Rome and Athens have bequeathed us. He knew, he cherished, he loved his Orient and he wanted []{#Chapter_43.xhtml_page_414}to introduce Old England to its products by, as it were, slipping them in, which could be accomplished only under Antiquity's seal of approval. Nowadays this isn't needed at all; in fact, it's harmful. We understand how to appreciate Oriental poetry, we acknowledge what's excellent in it; but let's compare it with itself, let's honour it within its own sphere and in that way forget that the Greeks and the Romans ever existed.

It can't annoy anybody if someone is reminded of Horace whilst reading Hafiz. On this subject, a connoisseur has declared himself in such a marvellous manner that this relation has now been spelled out and is done with once and for all. Here's what he says:

::: top
In their views on life, the similarity of Hafiz to Horace is striking; it can be explained only through the similarity of the ages in which both poets lived in which, because of the destruction of all security in civic life, man was confined to a fleeting enjoyment of life, snatched in the instant of its passing.^[79](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_79){#Chapter_43.xhtml_chfn79}^
:::

What we do entreat is that Firdowsi not be compared with Homer because he must show to disadvantage in every sense: in subject matter, form and treatment. Whoever wishes to be persuaded of this needs only compare the dreadful monotony of the seven adventures of Isfandiyar with the twenty-third book of *The Iliad* where the most varied prizes are won by the most diverse heroes in the most disparate ways at the funeral rites of Patroclus. Haven't we Germans inflicted the greatest damage on our own magnificent *Niebelungenlied* through such comparisons? As supremely pleasing when properly lodged within their own sphere, where they can be snugly and appreciatively integrated, such works appear all the odder when they are measured according to a standard which should never be applied to them.

[]{#Chapter_43.xhtml_page_415}The same is true of the work of an individual author who has written much for a long time and in the most varied manner. Leave it to the clueless rabble to praise, to single out and to reprove by using comparisons. But those who would instruct a people must take a position from which a distinct and universal overview replaces sheer uninformed judgment.

[]{#Chapter_44.xhtml}

<div>

### [COMPARISON]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Having rejected all comparisons in forming a judgement on a writer it will occasion amazement if we speak, right off the bat, of one instance in which we find comparison reliable. Even so, we hope that we'll be permitted this exception, since the idea belongs not to ourselves but to a third party.

A man steeped in the breadth, the heights and the deeps of the East is of the opinion that no German writer has come closer to eastern poets and other authors than Jean Paul Richter.^[80](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_80){#Chapter_44.xhtml_chfn80}^ This opinion struck us as too significant for us not to devote appropriate attention to it; moreover, we're able to convey our observations on the subject all the more easily since we can refer back to all that we've previously elaborated in such detail.

To be sure, taking personality as our starting point, the aforementioned friend's works testify to a sensible, attentive, perceptive, informed, cultured -- and as such, benevolent -- and pious mind. So talented a spirit gazes about his world in a bold and lively -- a genuinely Oriental -- manner, forges the oddest connections, reconciles the incompatible but in such a way that a secret ethical thread is woven into it so that the whole thing is brought to a kind of unity.

If we've pointed out and delineated the natural elements []{#Chapter_44.xhtml_page_416}from which the oldest and the best of the Oriental poets composed their works, we'll now explain ourselves more clearly by saying that whereas those poets worked in a fresh and simple region, our friend, by contrast, lives and works in a cultured, over-refined, excessively sophisticated, baffling world and for that very reason, has to be prepared to marshal the strangest elements. To illustrate the opposition between the milieu of a Bedouin and that of our author in a brief but vivid way, we extract the most telling expressions from a few pages:

Border treaties, supplementary pages, cardinals, side-alcove, billiards, beer mugs, national banks, sessional chairs, principal commissary, enthusiasm, sceptre-tail, breast pieces, squirrel-farmer, stockjobber \[*Agioteur*\], mudlark, incognito, colloquia, canonical billiard sack, plaster cast, advancement, apprentice blacksmith \[*Hüttenjunge*\], naturalisation file, Whitsun programme, Masonic, hand pantomime, amputated, supernumerary, jewellery stand, Sabbath way, etc.^[81](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_81){#Chapter_44.xhtml_chfn81}^

If these assembled expressions are familiar to a cultured German reader, or could be familiar through a dictionary, just as the outer world becomes known to an Easterner through caravans of merchants and pilgrims, so may we boldly take it as justified for a kindred spirit to put the same procedure to work in an utterly different context.

Should we acknowledge as well to our own author, as prolific as he is cherished, that living at a later period, he is obliged -- if he wishes to shine in his own day -- to play upon a state-of-affairs which has become so endlessly complicated and fragmented through art, science, technology, politics, the wages of peace and of war, as well as decline, in the most varied fashion -- should we do so, we think to have confirmed him in the Oriental qualities attributed to him in a fully satisfactory manner.

Even so, we will isolate a difference, a difference in []{#Chapter_44.xhtml_page_417}procedure in both poetry and prose. A poet, before whom rhythm, parallelism, the placement of syllables and rhyme seem to stand as the greatest obstacles in his path, turns this all to the most decisive advantage if he can successfully solve the conundrums which have been set before him or which he has set himself; we forgive the most reckless metaphor for the sake of an unexpected rhyme and we delight in the resourcefulness which the poet can claim in a position so constrained by necessity.

By contrast, the prose writer has a lot of elbow room and has to answer for every risk he permits himself; he is called to account for everything which might offend taste. But, as we've shown in some detail, since it's almost impossible to separate the proper from the improper in this sort of writing and versifying, here it all comes down to the individual who ventures on such a daredevil course. If it's a man like Jean Paul, a talent to be esteemed, a man of worth, then the reader feels drawn to him fondly at once; everything is permitted as well as welcome. You feel at ease in the presence of such a benevolent fellow; his feeling spreads out amongst us. He stimulates our imaginations, he flatters our failings, he firms up our strengths.

One exercises one's own wit in seeking to solve the marvellously proffered riddle, and delights in a gaudily circumscribed world, as though behind it there were charades and entertainments, excitement and strong emotion, and even moral uplift, to be discovered.

This is pretty much what we wanted to present to justify that comparison \[between Jean Paul and Oriental poets\]. We strove to express the points of similarity and of dissimilarity as concisely as we could; such a text could lead to limitless elaboration.

[]{#Chapter_45.xhtml}

<div>

### [[]{#Chapter_45.xhtml_page_418}PROTEST]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

If someone regards word and utterance as sacred witnesses, and not as loose change or cash to be produced for a quick momentary exchange, but means to proffer them as genuine equivalents in an exchange of the spirit, then no one can fault him for drawing attention to how conventional expressions, which everyone finds unobjectionable, still can exercise a malign influence, obfuscate ideas, distort concepts and impart a false direction to entire disciplines.

The usage which has been introduced under the heading 'Fine Arts of Speaking'^[82](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_82){#Chapter_45.xhtml_chfn82}^ may well fall into this category, when treated as a general rubric under which both poetry and prose, according to their various divisions, may be ordered, one after the other, and grasped.

Regarded purely and accurately, poetry is neither discourse nor art. It isn't discourse because it demands measure, melody, bodily movement and mimicry to be complete. It isn't an art because all depends upon naturalness which, to be sure, may be orderly but may not be artificially fussed and worried over; it remains forever the genuine expression of a spirit stirred into exaltation without purpose or goal.

But eloquence in its true meaning is a discourse and an art. It depends upon a clear, moderately passionate *discourse* and it is *art* in every respect. It pursues its objectives and is dissimulation from start to finish. Poetry has been degraded by that rubric, which we reject, in that it becomes assigned if not subordinated to rhetoric, and both its name and its honour are taken from it.

This designation and classification have of course won both approval and status because quite estimable books bear it on their brows, and it would be hard to leave off using it right away. And yet, such a state of affairs comes to pass because in classifying the arts, the artist is not consulted. For []{#Chapter_45.xhtml_page_419}the professional literary man, poetical works arrive initially as letters of the alphabet, they lie before him as books which he is called upon to order and arrange.

[]{#Chapter_46.xhtml}

<div>

### [GENRES]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Allegory, ballad, cantata, didactic poem, drama, elegy, epic, epigram, epistle, fable, héroïde, idyll, novel, ode, parody, romance, satire, tale.

If somebody set out to draw up a methodical arrangement of the aforementioned genres (which we've listed alphabetically), along with any number of others, he'd encounter major difficulties which are hard to sidestep. If you look more closely at the above categories, you'll find them so dubbed, now because of certain outer characteristics, now because of their content, but very few as a result of an intrinsic form. You note right away that some of them stand side by side while some are subordinate to others. With respect to pleasure and taste everyone can easily decide for himself; however, if a rational arrangement is needed for didactic or historical purposes, it's worth the trouble to look around for such a thing. Accordingly we offer the following for consideration.

[]{#Chapter_47.xhtml}

<div>

### [NATURAL FORMS OF POETRY]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

There are only three true natural forms of poetry: the clearly narrative, the passionately excited, and that which deals with persons -- Epic, Lyric and Drama. These three forms of poetry can work together or separately. They often occur together in the tiniest poem and through this conjunction in the smallest space they produce the most splendid figure, as we perceive clearly in the most precious ballads of all peoples. In the older Greek tragedy we see all three brought together, diverging from each other only in a specific sequence. As long as the []{#Chapter_47.xhtml_page_420}chorus plays the protagonist, the lyrical is on display; as the chorus becomes more of a spectator, the others emerge and finally, when the action draws persons and place together, the chorus turns uneasy and grating. In French tragedy, the exposition is epic, the middle dramatic and the fifth act, which unfurls with passion and fervour, can be called lyrical.

The Homeric heroic poem is pure epic. The rhapsode presides, he recounts what takes place; no one to whom he hasn't granted the word beforehand, whose discourse and response he has not announced, may open his mouth. Broken exchanges of dialogue, the drama's loveliest embellishment, are not allowed.

Should one, however, hear a modern improviser in a public square who deals with an historical event: first, he will engage in narrative, so as to be clear; then, to stir up interest, he'll speak as one of the characters of the action; finally, he will blaze with enthusiasm and sweep peoples' spirits away. To intertwine these elements is so wondrous, and the poetic forms are infinitely varied; for that very reason, it is so difficult to find the order by which they can be arranged alongside or after one another. A certain measure of assistance can come from placing the three principal elements over against one another in a circle and then looking for models in which each of the elements predominates singly. Examples can then be collected as they incline towards one side or the other until at last the combination of all three takes place and the whole circle is thereby closed upon itself.

In this way it's possible to gain fine insights into genres as well as into the character and the taste of nations in a chronological sequence. And although this approach may be more apt for one's own instruction, entertainment and measurement than for the instruction of others; yet one still may thereby establish a schema which at one and the same time represents the outer and incidental forms and the inner and necessary first stirrings in a comprehensible manner. Even so, the effort will always be as difficult as is the attempt to []{#Chapter_47.xhtml_page_421}discover the relationship in the natural sciences between the outer characteristics of minerals and plants and their innermost components, so as to represent to the mind an order commensurate with nature.

[]{#Chapter_48.xhtml}

<div>

### [ADDENDUM]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

It is worthy of note that Persian poetry has no drama. Had a dramatic poet been able to emerge, its whole literature would necessarily have worn a different aspect. The nation has a tendency to quietude; it likes to hear tales recited, hence the abundance of stories and poems beyond count. Then too life in the East isn't much given to chat about itself; despotism doesn't encourage conversation and we find that every objection to the will and command of the ruler emerges in any case only in quotes from the Qur'an and well-known passages of poetry, which however presupposes an ingenious mind, with breadth, depth and the fruits of education as well. Nevertheless, that the Oriental may dispense with the forms of conversation as little as any other people is evident in his high esteem for the *Fables* of Bidpai, and for the repetition, imitation and continuation of these. *The Parliament of the Birds* of Farid al-Din ῾Attar provides the loveliest example of this.

[]{#Chapter_49.xhtml}

<div>

### [THE BOOK-ORACLE]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

The person trapped in the sombre quotidian who scouts around for a brighter future snatches greedily at coincidences in order to scrabble out any kind of prophetic intimation. The indecisive man discovers his salvation only in the resolve to submit to the pronouncement of the lot that's cast. To this category belongs the universally practised convention of seeking an oracle from a significant book, between the pages []{#Chapter_49.xhtml_page_422}of which one places a pin and then gazes credulously at the passage indicated when the book is opened. We were once closely associated with people who sought trustworthy advice in just such a manner from the Bible, the *Schatzkästlein*,^[83](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_83){#Chapter_49.xhtml_chfn83}^ and other edifying works, and often got solace in the sorest need, nay, they were fortified for a lifetime.

We find this custom practised in the Orient too; it is called *fal* and the honour of the practice fell to Hafiz immediately after his death.^[84](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_84){#Chapter_49.xhtml_chfn84}^ At the time, the strictly orthodox didn't want to accord him proper obsequies; his poems were consulted and since the passage indicated mentioned that wanderers would honour his grave, the conclusion was drawn that he too had to be honourably buried. The Western poet plays on this practice as well and hopes that a comparable honour may befall his own book.^[85](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_85){#Chapter_49.xhtml_chfn85}^

[]{#Chapter_50.xhtml}

<div>

### [THE EXCHANGE OF FLOWERS AND SIGNS]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

In order not to posit some exaggerated goodness in the language of flowers or expect something steeped in tender sentiments, we have to let ourselves be instructed by those in the know. Individual flowers weren't accorded a meaning so that they could be gathered up and proffered as a bouquet of secret script, nor was it solely flowers which formed words and letters in such a mute colloquy, but rather, everything []{#Chapter_50.xhtml_page_423}visible, everything conveyable, was employed to equal effect.

Nevertheless, we can imagine how such a thing might happen, how a communication, an exchange of feelings and thoughts, might be produced, only if we keep the chief aspects of Oriental poetry firmly in view; namely, that broad, encompassing gaze over all the things of this world, the facility in rhyming, but also a particular delight in riddles -- and a native proclivity for them -- whereby an adeptness at solving riddles takes shape, as is obvious to everyone whose talent tends to the cultivation of riddles based on syllables and letters and the like.

To be noted here is that when a lover sends a beloved any kind of object, the recipient has to utter the word and then seek a rhyme for it; and yet, what might be spotted which would be suitable for the present situation amid all the possible rhymes? It's immediately apparent that an impassioned guesswork must prevail in this situation. One example can clarify the matter; hence, the little love story that follows in this connection.

::: top
The watchmen have been stalled

By sweet gratuities;

But how we've come to terms

We wish to disclose to others;

For, Sweetheart, what brought us joy

Must avail others too,

And so we will rub clean

The dark lamps of the night of love,

And whoever then succeeds with us

In tuning a sensitive ear,

And loves as we do, will find it light

To rhyme to the proper sense.

I sent to you and you sent to me

And we both understood at once.

The foregoing odd manner of communication is something quickly put into practice amongst lively people who are attracted to each other. As soon as the mind takes such a tack it performs wonders. One story out of many possible will serve as proof.

Two loving couples take a pleasure trip of several miles and spend a happy day together. On the way back they amuse themselves by playing word-games. Not only is each one guessed as soon as it's uttered but in the end, even the word which the other has in mind and is just about to turn into a riddle is recognised and uttered by a process of instantaneous divination.

In as much as the very same thing is recounted as well as affirmed in our own times, one need not be afraid of []{#Chapter_50.xhtml_page_426}appearing ridiculous, since such psychic phenomena still remain far from the attainment of what organic magnetism has brought to light.^[87](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_87){#Chapter_50.xhtml_chfn87}^

But there's another way of making oneself understood which is both witty and sincere! If in the preceding, ear and wit were at play, here there is a tenderly affectionate aesthetic sense which stands on a par with the loftiest poetry.

In the Orient the Qur'an is learned by heart and as a result, the slightest play on its suras and verses affords quick comprehension amongst its adepts. We've experienced the same thing in Germany where fifty years ago, education was set up in such a way as to make the entire younger generation firm in their biblical knowledge; one learned not only important sayings by heart but also attained an adequate knowledge of the rest. There were many people who stood fully prepared to supply biblical maxims for everything that transpired and to make use of sacred scripture in their conversations. It can't be denied that the wittiest and most graceful rejoinders emerged as when, even in our day, certain eternally applicable passages crop up here and there in conversation.

Classical dicta serve a similar purpose and through them we mark and express ever recurrent feelings and experiences.

Fifty years ago, when we were young, we too, wishing to show honour to our native poets, quickened our memories through their writings and showered them with the finest applause in expressing our own thoughts through their well-chosen and cultivated words and in that way we acknowledged that they knew how to unfurl our innermost feelings better than we ourselves did.

[]{#Chapter_51.xhtml_page_427}Still, to achieve our true purpose, we call to mind a well-known, yet quite mysterious, way of communicating in ciphers. To wit, when two people agree on a certain book and append page and line numbers to a letter, they can be certain that the recipient will work out the meaning with little difficulty.

The song, which we designate under the rubric 'Cipher', alludes to just such an agreement. Lovers will take certain poems by Hafiz as instruments for the exchange of their feelings. They indicate the page and the line which express their circumstances of the moment and in this way, collaboratively composed poems come about, most beautifully expressed. Splendidly scattered passages from this inestimable poet are joined together through passion and feeling, inclination and choice bestow an inner life on the whole of it, and the separated lovers, adorning their grief with the pearls of his words, find some solace in the outcome.

### [PROSPECTIVE DIVAN]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

At a certain period in Germany many imprints were distributed as manuscripts for friends. Whoever may find this off-putting should keep in mind that in the end every book is written only for an author's sympathisers, friends and admirers. I'd like to designate my own *Divan* in particular, the present edition of which can only be considered as incomplete. When I was younger, I would have had to hold it back longer; now, however, I find it more advantageous to assemble it myself than to bequeath such an undertaking to posterity, as Hafiz did. For the very fact that this little book stands there so, as I am now able to send it forth, arouses my desire to accord it, bit by bit, the full completion that it deserves. I now intend to indicate, book by book, and in proper order, what might still be hoped for from it.

*The Book of the Singer*.^[89](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_89){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn89}^ In this part, as it now stands, vivid impressions of numerous objects and manifestations []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_429}upon the senses and the spirit are expressed enthusiastically, and the close connections of the poet to the Orient are indicated. Were he to keep to this course, the happy garden might be embellished most charmingly; nevertheless, the design will expand with supreme felicity if the poet doesn't deal solely with himself and out of himself but rather expresses his gratitude in honour of patrons and friends, so as to clasp the living close with friendly words and to summon back those who have departed with fitting reverence.

Here though it should be kept in mind that the Oriental soar and glide, that rich and excessively laudatory sort of poetry, may not suit Westerners' sentiments. We comport ourselves with lofty freedom without taking refuge in hyperbole; and really, only a pure, finely felt poetry can articulate the genuine virtues of outstanding men, those whose perfections can be perceived only when they have passed beyond, when their individual foibles no longer annoy us and the consequences of their activities still stand, daily and hourly, before our eyes. The poet paid off a part of this debt not long ago, at a festive celebration in the presence of the Most Exalted \[Empress\], by offering wishes for happiness in his own convivial fashion.^[90](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_90){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn90}^

*The Book of Hafiz*.^[91](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_91){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn91}^ If all those who use Arabic and related languages were born and raised as poets, one might imagine that exceptional spirits beyond number would emerge within such a nation. But if such a people recognises merely seven poets of the first rank in five hundred years, then we need to accept such an observation with deep respect, for it alone makes it possible for us to enquire on what such excellence really is based.

Inasmuch as it's possible to discharge, this task may very well be reserved too for the future *Divan*. For, to speak only []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_430}of Hafiz, admiration of him and partiality for him increase the more one gets to know him. The most felicitous naturalness, high culture, effortless facility and the pure conviction that one gives people pleasure only when one sings to them what they would most enjoy hearing in comfort and ease while at the same time occasionally slipping to them things which are heavy, hard and unpalatable. If those in the know glimpse an image of Hafiz in the following poem, this attempt will gladden the Western poet exceedingly.

*The Book of Love* would swell considerably if six loving couples stepped forth in their various joys and sorrows; and still others might appear alongside them with greater or lesser clarity out of the murky past. Wamiq and ῾Asra', for example, of whom no further notice exists beyond their names, might be introduced in the following manner:

:::

This book is no less prone to symbolic digression, which can scarcely be avoided in the Orient. The man of wit, dissatisfied with what is presented to him, regards everything offered to his senses as a disguise behind which a higher life of the spirit []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_433}lies mischievously and stubbornly concealed for the purpose of drawing us on and luring us into more exalted regions. If a poet proceeds here with measure and deliberation, it can be legitimate to take pleasure in this and to test one's pinions on bolder flights.

*The Book of Reflections*^[103](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_103){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn103}^ expands daily for him who dwells in the Orient; for there everything is reflection, wavering between the sensual and the suprasensual, without ever settling decisively on one or the other. The meditation which is urged upon one is of an idiosyncratic sort; it isn't dedicated solely to cleverness, even if this does make the strongest claims, but it is directed at the same time towards those points at which the strangest problems of earthly life stand starkly and pitilessly before us and oblige us to bend the knee before chance, before providence and its unsearchable decrees, and to express unqualified acceptance as the highest political, ethical and religious law.

*Book of Ill-humour.*^[104](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_104){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn104}^ If the other books grow, the same privilege should be extended to this one. But cheerful, graceful, judicious ingredients have to be collected beforehand so the outbursts of ill-humour can be tolerable. Good will to men in general and benevolent and charitable feelings bind earth to heaven and make ready a paradise bestowed on humankind. By contrast, iIl-humour is forever egotistical, it is made up of unappeasable demands; it is presumptuous, pushy and pleases no one, scarcely even those who are seized by the same feeling. Nevertheless, no human being can always restrain himself from such outbursts; indeed, he's doing well if he aims to puncture his displeasure in this way, especially over some activity that's been hindered or impaired. This particular book could have been much stronger and richer; however, we have set much aside in order to avoid bad feeling. Here we merely observe that those same utterances, []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_434}which for the moment seem questionable but which in the long term will prove innocuous, will be gathered up with cheerfulness and benevolence and saved under the rubric *Paralipomena* for future years.

Here we take the opportunity to speak about overbearing arrogance and, first and foremost, how it manifests itself in the Orient. The ruler himself is first in arrogance, seeming to exclude all others. Everyone stands in his service; he is his own commander, no one commands him, and his own will constructs the rest of the world so that he can be compared with the sun, indeed, with the cosmos. Even so, it's striking that at the same time he is compelled to select a co-regent who stands at his side in this unbounded sphere and keeps him seated on the throne of all the worlds. This is the poet who works with him and alongside him and who exalts him far above other mortals. Should a number of like talents gather at his court, he gives them a king of the poets and in that way he acknowledges the highest talent as in his image. But the poet is encouraged, even led, by this to think as highly of himself as of his prince and to feel that he shares in ownership of the greatest excellence and felicity. He's fortified in this by the limitless gifts he receives, the wealth he accumulates and the effect he exercises. He becomes so firmly set in this way of thinking that any failure of his hopes drives him crazy. For his *Shah-nameh* Firdowsi expects sixty thousand pieces of gold, relying on an earlier statement of his emperor, but when he gets only sixty thousand pieces of silver instead, he splits the sum into three parts while sitting in his bath, gives one to the courier, another to the bath attendant and spends the third part on sherbets; then, with a few scurrilous lines of abuse, he at once cancels all the encomia which for so many years he had lavished on the Shah. He flees, goes into hiding, refuses to be recalled; instead, he passes his own hatred on to his relatives so that his sister scorns and refuses to accept a substantial gift sent by the placated Sultan but which arrived unfortunately only after Firdowsi's death.

[]{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_435}If we wished to develop all this a bit further we'd say that from the throne down, and descending step by step to the dervish on the street corner, everyone is found to be crammed with arrogance, filled with worldly as well as spiritual pride which springs out vehemently and at once at the slightest provocation.

With respect to this ethical defect, if it can be considered such, the West looks quite wonderful. Modesty is really a social virtue; it betokens great refinement; it is self-denial directed outwardly but which, resting on a great inner sense of worth, is regarded as the highest of human qualities. Hence we hear that the rabble always praises modesty in the most eminent men, without dwelling particularly on other qualities. But modesty is always bound up with dissimulation and a kind of fawning which is all the more efficacious in that without the least impertinence it benefits the other by leaving him undisturbed in his comfortable self-regard. And yet, what is termed good society consists in an ever-increasing denial of oneself so that in the end, society itself becomes utterly null; it then has to cultivate talent in order that we may satisfy our own vanity by learning how to flatter the vanity of others.

Nevertheless, we'd like to reconcile our compatriots to the arrogant presumptions of our own Western poet.^[105](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_105){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn105}^ A certain boastful ostentation^[106](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_106){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn106}^ shouldn't be missing from the *Divan* if its Oriental character is to be expressed to some degree.

The poet couldn't lapse into disagreeable presumption against the upper classes. His fortunate position raised him above every struggle with despotism. The world agrees with the praise which he was able to bestow on his princely benefactors. The lofty persons with whom he stood once in relationship were praised and are still praised. In fact, one []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_436}can reproach the poet that the share of encomia in his *Divan* is not sufficiently abundant.

But with respect to the *Book of Ill-Humour* one would really like to find things in it to reprove. Every vexed fellow expresses himself too blatantly -- his personal expectations haven't been met, his merit hasn't been recognised! Yes, he too! He's not constrained from above but he suffers from below and from the side. An importunate, often shallow, often vicious rabble with its choirmasters cripples his activity; initially he girds himself with pride and disdain but then, too sharply stung and harried, he feels himself strong enough to hew his way through.

But just as we are about to intimate to him that he can soften many a presumption by having recourse in the final instance, with wit and feeling, to his Beloved, he humbles, nay, annihilates, himself before her. The reader's heart and mind will chalk this up to his credit.

*The Book of Wisdom*^[107](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_107){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn107}^ should swell out before the others; it is quite closely related to the *Books of Reflections* and *Ill- Humour*. Oriental maxims, however, contain the distinctive character of their poetic art as a whole in that they very often bear upon sensuous and visible objects; and amongst these are many which one might rightly call laconic parables. This category is the most difficult for Westerners since our surroundings seem too dry, regulated and prosaic. Even so, old German proverbs, in which the sense is shaped into simile, could be our model here.

*The Book of Timur*.^[108](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_108){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn108}^ This really should be set on a good foundation, and perhaps several years must pass, so that an exalted view of tremendous historical events no longer distorts our view. This tragedy might be lightened if one decided to let Nasreddin Hoja, the dread world-destroyer's jocular companion in both tent and battlefield, step forward from []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_437}time to time.^[109](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_109){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn109}^ Pleasant hours, free fancy, offer the best support. We here append a sampling of these little tales which have been transmitted to us.

\*

Timur was an ugly fellow; he was blind in one eye and lame in one foot. One day when Hoja was with him, Timur scratched his head -- it was time for a haircut -- and commanded that the barber be summoned. After he'd shaved his head the barber put a mirror in Timur's hand, as usual. Timur looked at himself in the mirror and found his appearance exceedingly ugly. He started to weep over this, Hoja began to weep too, and the two of them went on weeping for a few hours. At this one of Timur's companions comforted him and entertained him with strange tales so that he might forget everything. Timur stopped crying but Hoja did not; in fact, he began crying even more strongly. At last Timur said to Hoja: 'Listen! I looked in the mirror and I saw how ugly I was. I was saddened by this because not only am I emperor but I also have great property and many slaves, and yet, I am so very ugly; that's why I cried. But why do you keep on crying without cease?' Hoja replied, 'If you looked in the mirror just once and at the sight of your own face you couldn't stand looking at yourself, what should we do who have to look at your face by day and by night? If we don't weep, who should? That's why I wept.' Timur was beside himself with laughter.

*The Book of Suleika.* This is the strongest part of the entire collection and might well be considered closed. The breath and spirit of a passion which wafts through all of it aren't easy to recover and yet, their return, like that of a fine vintage, can at least be awaited in hope and humility.

Even so, we may add some observations on the []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_438}demeanour of our Western poet in this book. Following the example of many of his eastern precursors he remains aloof from the Sultan. As a frugal dervish he may even compare himself with the prince; for the thoroughgoing beggar is a kind of king. Poverty prompts audacity. Not to acknowledge the value of worldly goods, to ask for none of them, or at least very little, is his resolve, and this produces an utterly carefree sense of contentment. Instead of chasing after anxiety-provoking possessions, he bestows lands and treasures in his thoughts and mocks anyone who once really owned and then lost such things. Our poet has truly pledged himself to voluntary poverty in order to step forth all the more proudly for there is a maiden involved and for her sake that poverty is sacred and ever-present before him.

And yet, he boasts of a still greater lack: youth has left him. He decks his old age, his grey hair, with Suleika's love, not in some foppish and impertinent fashion^[110](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_110){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn110}^-- no! but in the certainty that she returns his love. She, so rich in brilliance, can value brilliance of mind, which brings youth to early fruition and rejuvenates old age.

*The Book of the Cup-Bearer.*^[111](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_111){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn111}^ Neither the immoderate inclination to wine, half forbidden as it is, nor tender feelings for the beauty of a growing boy should be scanted in the *Divan*; however, the latter will be treated quite chastely in conformity with our customs.

The reciprocal attraction of youth and old age actually points to an authentically pedagogical relationship. A child's passionate inclination for an old man is not at all a rare phenomenon but it is a rarely exploited one. We permit the relationship of the grandson with the grandfather, or that of the late-born heir with the tenderly astonished father. The intelligence of children really develops in such relationships; they become aware of the dignity, experience and power of the older person; here pure-born souls feel the need of a []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_439}reverential inclination; old age is stirred and held fast. If youth feels and employs its superiority to attain childish goals and satisfy childish needs, we are reconciled by its graceful charm combined with precocious mischievousness. Nevertheless, there is something profoundly moving about a boy's sense of ever striving onward when he is stirred by the lofty spirit of old age and, in amazement at himself, has the presentiment that he too is capable of fostering something comparable within himself. We sought to indicate such lovely relations in the *Book of the Cup-Bearer* and to set out contemporary instances as well. Sa῾di has, however, preserved some examples for us, the delicate tenderness of which -- universally acknowledged as they are -- offers us the most thorough understanding.

Thus he relates the following in his *Rose Garden*:^[112](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_112){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn112}^ 'When Mahmud, the king of Khwarezm, made peace with the king of Chatta \[Cathay\], I went into the church^[113](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_113){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn113}^ at Kashgar (a city of the Uzbeks or Tartars) where, as you know, school is held; and there I saw a boy utterly lovely in form and face. He held a grammar book in his hand in order to learn to speak well and correctly. He read out loud as one example of a rule: *daraba Zaydun* ῾*Amran* ('Zayd beat ῾Amr').^[114](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_114){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn114}^ '*Amran*' is in the accusative. (These names serve here as general appellations of adversaries, just as Germans say 'Hinz' or 'Kunz.') When he had repeated these words a few times, so as to imprint them on his memory, I said to him, 'Khwarezm and Chatta have at last made peace, so should Zayd and ῾Amr keep on fighting one another?' The boy laughed charmingly and asked what country I came from. When I replied that I came from Shiraz, he asked whether I knew any of Sa῾di's writings by heart, for he was very fond of the Persian language.

[]{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_440}I replied: 'Just as you have given yourself heart and mind to the study of grammar, out of your love for pure language, so too has my heart given itself wholly to you in love, such that the image of your nature has stolen the image of my reason.' He looked at me attentively as though he wanted to determine whether the words I'd spoken were the poet's or expressed my own feelings. But I went on, 'You have caught the lover's heart in a net, as did Zayd. We would go about happily with you but you are hostile and ill disposed against us, like Zayd against ῾Amr.' But he replied to me with embarrassed diffidence in verses from my own poems and I had the benefit of being able to recite the most beautiful of them all to him; and so we passed several days together in such graceful exchanges. But when the court got ready to depart once more and we prepared to take our leave early in the morning, one of our travelling companions said to him, 'That is Sa'di himself after whom you were asking.'

The boy came running swiftly, placed himself before me in a friendly but reverent manner, and expressed the wish to have known who I was earlier. He said, 'Why didn't you disclose yourself to me that day and say, "I'm Sa῾di" so that I might offer you fitting tribute to the best of my ability and lay my humble service at your feet?' I answered, 'When I looked upon you, I could not utter the words "I am he", my heart broke open towards you like a rose which is beginning to bloom.' He went on to ask whether it might not be possible for me to stay a few more days so that he could learn something of art and scholarship from me, but I replied, 'It cannot be; for here I see eminent people sitting between great mountains but I'd be happy to have a cave somewhere in the world and remain inside it.'^[115](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_115){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn115}^ At this he seemed to be a bit sad and so I asked why he didn't betake himself to the city []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_441}where he could free his heart from the bondage of melancholy and live more cheerfully. He replied that there were indeed many lovely and charming sights in the city but that it was also so muddy and slippery that even elephants could slip and fall. 'And I too \[he said\] wouldn't remain on a firm footing if faced with such wicked examples.' When we'd spoken we kissed one another on face and forehead and took our leave. And what the poet wrote was true: 'Lovers at parting are like beautiful apples: a cheek which presses against another cheek reddens with liveliness and pleasure and yet, the cheek on the other side is pale with a wasting sorrow.'

In another passage the same poet recounts:^[116](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_116){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn116}^

'In my youth I formed a firm and lasting friendship with a youth like myself. In my eyes his brow was like the heavens to which we turn when we pray as to a magnet. His companionship was the best gain of all my wheeling and dealing. I hold that no human being on earth could be compared with him in demeanour, uprightness and honour, though amongst the angels there might be one. After I had enjoyed such friendship I lost it and after his death it seemed wrong for me to confer my love on another. For his foot was caught unawares in the snare of his fate so that he had to hasten to his grave. I sat and I lay at his grave like a watchman for a good spell and uttered laments over his death and our separation which I myself as well as others still find moving.'

*The Book of Parables.*^[117](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_117){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn117}^ Even though Western nations have made much of the riches of the Orient their own, still there remains much to be gleaned here, and we present what follows as a way of indicating that.

Parables, like other Oriental poetic modes which relate to manners, can be divided rather handily into three different categories: ethical, moral and ascetic. The first category includes episodes and intimations which refer to people and their circumstances generally without expressing a view as to []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_442}what is good and what bad. Nevertheless, that is presupposed in excellent fashion by the second category in which the auditor is presented with a rational choice. The third category, by contrast, affixes a decisive constraint: the ethical prompting becomes commandment and law. These give rise to a fourth category which represents the marvellous directions and dispensations which emerge out of the unsearchable and inscrutable decrees of God; which teaches and confirms the genuine Islam, that unconditional submission to God's will, and the conviction that no one can evade his fate once it has been determined. Perhaps one might even add a fifth category which we would have to call 'the mystical'. It impels people from their former circumstances, which remain continually anxious and oppressive, towards union with God in this life and a provisional renunciation of those very goods whose possible loss can cause us pain. If one can sort out the various purposes behind all the pictorial representations of the Orient, much has been gained, since otherwise one always feels obstructed when they are jumbled together, now seeking out some useful purpose where none exists, but all the while overlooking some deeper significance. To offer striking examples of the range of types must make *The Book of Parables* both interesting and instructive. To what end the elements which we've offered here may be directed we leave to the astute reader's discretion.

*The Book of the Parsi*.^[118](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_118){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn118}^ Multiple distractions alone have prevented the poet from representing the worship of sun and fire -- seemingly so abstract and yet so gripping in practice -- in verse to its full extent, for which the most marvellous materials are at hand. May he be granted the happy opportunity at some point to fill this gap!

*The Book of Paradise*.^[119](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_119){#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn119}^ This area of Muslim belief too has so many astonishingly lovely locales -- paradises within paradises -- that one would love to enter, where one would []{#Chapter_52.xhtml_page_443}love to dwell. Solemnity and light-heartedness intertwine so delightfully here and the common light of day, now transfigured, gives us wings to rise ever higher and reach the farthest heights. What could stop the poet from mounting Muhammad's miraculous horse and soaring through all the heavens? Why shouldn't he reverently celebrate that hallowed night in which the Qur'an was conveyed in its entirety to the Prophet from on high? Here too much is yet to be gained.

### [OLD TESTAMENT MATTERS]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Now that I've cajoled myself with the sweet hope that with respect to both the *Divan* itself and its accompanying notes I may yet achieve a great deal of effect, I skim through my preparatory work which lies before me, unused and unrealised, in innumerable pages. There I come upon an essay, written some twenty-five years earlier, which refers to papers and studies which are themselves much older.

My friends will recall from my biographical ventures^[120](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_120){#Chapter_53.xhtml_chfn120}^ that I devoted much time and attention to the First Book of Moses^[121](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_121){#Chapter_53.xhtml_chfn121}^ and spent many a day of my youth strolling amongst the paradises of the East. To the historical books which followed my inclination and my zeal were also applied. The four last Books of Moses demanded diligent efforts and the essay that follows contains the peculiar results. May that essay be accorded a place at this point. For since all our peregrinations through the Orient were occasioned by the Holy Scriptures, we come back to them over and over as to springs of water, supremely vivifying even if occasionally muddied, coursing in concealment in the earth only to gush forth, pure and fresh, yet again.

### [[]{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_444}ISRAEL IN THE DESERT^[122](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_122){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn122}^]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

'Then a new king ascended the throne of Egypt, who knew nothing of Joseph.'^[123](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_123){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn123}^ For the ruler as for his people the name of his benefactor had vanished; even for the Israelites themselves the names of their forefathers seem to have sounded like ancient chimes from afar. In four hundred years the little family had multiplied beyond belief. The promise made by God to its great patriarch amid so many uncertainties had been fulfilled. And yet, what sort of succour did it offer? Their very numbers rendered them suspect to the principal inhabitants of the land. Attempts were made to torment, terrorise, harass and exterminate them and even as their stiff-necked nature armed them against this, they could clearly foresee their utter destruction as they, once-free keepers of flocks, were forced to build strong cities with their own hands in and around the borders of Egypt, places which were openly intended to serve as sites of oppression and imprisonment for them.

But here we pause before going any farther and toiling through strange, wretchedly edited books to ask what residue would be left behind as a basis, as primordial matter, of the four last Books of Moses, given that we find it necessary to recall so much as well as to keep so much at a remove?

The original, the unique, the deepest theme of world history and the history of humankind, to which all else must be subordinate, is still the conflict between unbelief and belief. All epochs in which faith reigns supreme, in whatever form it takes, are brilliant, uplifting and fruitful for their own times and for posterity. But all epochs in which unbelief asserts its sorry triumph, in whatever form, even if it may strut and glitter with a spurious lustre, sink without a trace for posterity simply because no one likes wasting his time learning about what is unfruitful.

If the first Book of Moses portrays the triumph of belief, []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_445}the last four -- Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deutoronomy -- take unbelief as their theme. True, this unbelief doesn't contest and combat belief (which certainly doesn't stand revealed in its entire fullness) in the pettiest ways but rather shoves obstacles in its path, step by step. Such unbelief is neither cured nor uprooted, either by occasional good deeds or, more often, by ghastly penalties; it is only temporarily stilled and because of that, it ever continues its slithering advance until it threatens to wreck, at its very inception, a sublime and noble enterprise undertaken on the most magnanimous promises of a trustworthy national God and which can never be fully and finally consummated. If, at least at first glance, the jumbled contents are distasteful to us, making the motifs threading the whole so tedious and grim, the books themselves have become even more unendurable because of the markedly dour and incomprehensible way in which they have been put together. Everywhere we see the sweep of history blocked by countless interpolated laws the true cause and intention of which can for the most part scarcely be grasped; or in any case, not why they were given at a certain moment or, if of later provenance, why they've been introduced and inserted in this passage. It's hard to discern why during some huge military campaign, already exposed to so many obstacles, the protagonists are quite intentionally and trivially preoccupied with multiplying all the religious ceremonial baggage by which every forward movement is fatally weighed down. It's hard to grasp why laws are promulgated for a vague and unknowable future while every day and every hour good counsel and right action are missing, and the commander, obliged to stand on his own two feet, hurls himself again and again face downward to beseech favours and punishments from on high, both of which are merely frittered away so that the principal aim for a baffled people is completely lost to sight.

To find my way in this labyrinth I set myself the task of meticulously sorting out what is really narrative, whether this []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_446}pertains to history, fable -- or both at the same time -- or to poetry. I separated all this from whatever was taught and commanded. In the first category I understood all that pertains to all countries and all ethical people; in the second, I placed whatever specifically addresses and unites the Israelites. I myself hardly dare to judge to what extent I've succeeded in this since at the moment I'm no longer in a position to carry those studies forward; instead, I'm compiling whatever I can display out of papers old and new, as time permits. There are two things to which I'd like to direct my readers' attention. First, to the development of the entire story of this miraculous journey out of the very character of its leader who initially doesn't appear in the most favourable light; and second, to the suspicion that the journey lasted not forty years but scarcely two; during which the leader whose comportment we were at first obliged to fault, is once again justified and restored to honour. But at the same time, the honour of the national God is rescued from the slur of hard-heartedness which is even less agreeable than His people's obstinacy, and He is just about reinstated in His former purity.

Let's first of all remember the people of Israel in Egypt whose oppressed condition posterity is summoned to share. Amongst this race of the mighty tribe of Levi a powerful man stepped forth; a lively sense of justice and injustice characterised him. He appeared worthy of his fierce ancestors, of whom the patriarch \[Jacob\] proclaimed, 'The brothers Simeon and Levi! Their swords are murderous weapons. My soul will not enter their council and my honour will not be in their assembly! For in their wrath they strangled the man and in their wickedness they ruined the oxen. Cursed be their fury that is so vehement, and their wrath that is so obstinate! I will scatter them in Jacob and strew them in Israel.' ^[124](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_124){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn124}^

This is wholly the spirit in which Moses manifests []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_447}himself. He secretly slays the Egyptian who has mistreated an Israelite. His patriotic assassination is discovered and he has to flee. One doesn't need to look for causes in the upbringing of someone who commits such a deed and presents himself as a mere child of nature. He received the favour of a princess as a young boy, he was reared at court; nothing acted upon him; he grew into a fine, strong man but one who remained rough and unpolished under all circumstances. And we too find him to be just such a powerful, volatile, withdrawn man, incapable of expressing himself, in his exile as well. His bold fist earns him the affection of a royal priest of Midian who at once brings him into his family.^[125](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_125){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn125}^ Now he gets to know the desert where one day in the future he will emerge in the trying role of a commander of armies.

Before anything else let us cast a glance at the Midianites amongst whom Moses now finds himself. We need to acknowledge them as a great people, which like all nomadic and trading peoples, appears even greater than it actually is thanks to its many activities and its lively dispersion. We find Midianites on Mount Horeb, on the western side of the little gulf and from there toward Moab and the Arnon.^[126](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_126){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn126}^ At times we find them as merchants travelling in caravans through Canaan toward Egypt.

Moses lived among such cultured people from now on but as a shepherd, withdrawn and set apart. We see him in the most grievous circumstances in which an exceptional man can find himself -- a man born not for contemplation and reflection but for action -- now isolated in the wilderness but constantly preoccupied by the destiny of his people, constantly turned toward the god of his forefathers, and painfully aware of his banishment from a land which, while it isn't the land of his ancestors, is at present his people's homeland. Too weak to have any effect through his own physical force in this great []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_448}matter, quite incapable of drawing up a plan, and even if he were capable of doing so, quite maladroit at undertaking a coherent oral discourse in which personality shows to advantage. It's hardly surprising that so forceful a character would eat himself alive in such circumstances.

In this situation the links which are maintained with his own people through the caravans passing to and fro can afford him some consolation. After much doubt and hesitation he decides to return and become the saviour of his people. His brother Aaron comes to him and he learns for the first time that the ferment amongst the populace has swelled precipitously. Now both brothers venture to present themselves to the king as representatives. But the latter is clearly not at all inclined to relinquish this multitude of people so easily -- settled for centuries in his land, initially keepers of flocks but then schooled in agriculture, arts and crafts, they had intermixed with his vassals and at the very least, their uncouth masses could be employed in levies for the erection of colossal monuments and the construction of new cities and fortresses -- he isn't inclined to allow them to return to their old autonomy.

And so their request was turned down and during the outbreak of the plagues, ever more urgently repeated and ever more stubbornly refused. But the Hebrews, now mobilised, with a promised land in sight which an ancient tradition had promised them and with hopes for independence and selfgovernment, acknowledged no further duties. Under the guise of a general celebration, they wheedled gold and silver settings from their neighbours and just when the Egyptians supposed that the Israelites were engaged in harmless banqueting, a Sicilian Vespers in reverse was set in motion.^[127](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_127){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn127}^ This time the stranger murdered the inhabitant, the guest []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_449}the host, and guided by a cruel policy, they slew only the firstborn; this, in a country where the firstborn enjoys so many rights, for the purpose of distracting the later-born so as to be able to elude immediate revenge through precipitous flight.^[128](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_128){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn128}^ The stratagem succeeded; the murderers were not punished but expelled. Only later did the king muster his army; but these horsemen and chariots, ordinarily so terrifying to people on foot, fight an unequal battle on swampy ground with the lightly armed, and skimpy, rear-guard; indeed, very possibly with the same bold and determined swarms who had already had practice by carrying out that bold stroke of murder at large, and whom we won't fail to designate, and recognise once more, by the consequences of their horrid acts.

Such a fighting force and a people on the march, well equipped for both attack and defence, could choose more than one path into the Promised Land. The first choice, at the sea, via Gaza, was not a caravan route and could prove dangerous because of its well-armed and warlike inhabitants. The second one, though more distant, appeared to offer more safety as well as great advantages. It led on the Red Sea to Sinai, from whence there were two directions which could be taken. The first of these, which ran directly to the goal, went along a small bay through the land of the Midians and Moabites to the Jordan; the second one, straight through the wilderness, led to Kadesh; on the former route the land of Edom lay to the left but on this one to the right. Moses probably preferred the former way but he seems to have been directed to the second way by the clever Midianites, as we might think to do at the outset, when we spoke earlier of the sombre mood in which the portrayal of the outer circumstances accompanying this exodus puts us.

The bright night sky gleaming with countless stars, which []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_450}Abraham was shown by his God, no longer extends its golden tent above us. Instead of resembling those shining lights of heaven, an innumerable populace sets out sullenly into a bleak wilderness. All gladsome phenomena have vanished; only tongues of fire appear at every corner, every turn. The Lord who called Moses out of a burning bush now moves on ahead of the mass of people in a dreary smoke-blaze which by day can be addressed as a pillar of cloud, by night as a fiery comet. From Mount Sinai's cloud-capped summit lightning and thunder break terrifyingly and at any infraction, however minor, flames burst from the earth and consume the outskirts of the encampment. Food and drink are ever scarcer and the people's vexed longing to turn back only gets more anxious the less their leader can help in any fundamental way.

Early on, even before the column reaches the Sinai, Jethro comes to meet his son-in-law, brings him daughters and grandchildren, kept safe in the patriarchal tent against a time of need, and shows himself to be a shrewd fellow. Such a people as the Midianites, who follow their own course freely and know how to find occasions to put their strengths to use, have to be better formed than a people that lives under a foreign yoke and is constantly at loggerheads both with itself and its conditions. And how capable of far loftier views must the leader of that folk be than a morose, self-contained, upright man, who feels himself born to action and command but to whom nature has denied the tools for such hazardous handiwork.

Moses couldn't rise to the notion that a leader is not ubiquitous nor that he doesn't have to do everything himself. On the contrary, he made the administration of his duties quite distasteful and burdensome to himself through his own personal involvement. Jethro is the first who opens his eyes to this; he helps him organise the people and direct his subordinates -- something at which he himself would have certainly failed.^[129](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_129){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn129}^

Jethro may not have been considering only what was best []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_451}for his son-in-law and the Israelites but may have had his own benefit and that of the Midianites in mind as well. Moses now comes to him -- Moses whom he took in earlier as a fugitive and until recently counted among his servants and retainers -- at the head of a huge throng which has left its former habitation to seek a new territory and which spreads terror and dread wherever it goes.

It can't elude this perceptive man that the quickest route for the children of Israel goes through the holdings of the Midianites, that this march will encounter his people's flocks at every turn, will infringe its settlements and indeed, come smack up against its well-appointed cities. The principles governing such a nomadic people aren't mysterious: they are founded on the right of conquest. It doesn't proceed without resistance and in all resistance it sees injustice; whoever defends what is his is an enemy who can be destroyed without mercy.

To envision the fate to which a populace would be exposed were such a locust swarm to roll across it didn't take any unusual foresight. And here the suspicion first begins to dawn that Jethro counselled against the best and quickest way and persuaded him to take the way straight through the wilderness. This suspicion is strengthened since Hobab never stirs from his brother-in-law's side until he sees him well down the recommended path; in fact, he even accompanies him farther in order to keep the line of march safely away from the dwellings of the Midianites.

The departure of which we're speaking occurred just fourteen months after the exodus from Egypt. Along the way the people designated a spot where they had undergone great trials because of their wantonness by the name 'Craving-Graves'.^[130](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_130){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn130}^ Then they proceeded toward Hazaroth and camped further along in the wilderness of Paran. The course they took remains beyond doubt. They were now []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_452}approaching the goal of their journey; only the mountain stood in their way which separated the land of Canaan from the wilderness. They decided to send scouts out and in the meantime moved closer to Kadesh. And here the envoys returned, bringing tidings of the land's great excellence but unfortunately of the fearsome inhabitants as well. Now there arose, however, a grievous division and the strife between belief and unbelief began anew.

Unfortunately Moses had even less talent as a field commander than as a ruler. During the battles against the Amalekites, he betook himself up a mountain to pray while Joshua at the head of the army finally won the victory which had been long shifting back and forth between the two forces. Now, at Kadesh, another difficult situation arose. Joshua and Caleb, the pluckiest of the twelve emissaries, counselled attack, calling out, confident of winning the territory. But meanwhile fear and alarm are stirred up on all sides through exaggerated descriptions of the armed and gigantic inhabitants of the land; the army is cowed, refuses to budge. Moses yet again is unable to help; at first he musters them but then an attack from this side strikes him as hazardous. He proposes to move eastward. At this point it may appear ignoble to that upright element in the army to abandon such a serious and painstakingly elaborated plan towards this long hoped-for goal. They band together and actually climb the mountain. Moses remains behind; the Ark of the Covenant is not set in motion and so it isn't fitting for either Joshua or Caleb to lead these bolder spirits. Enough! The unsupported, high-handed vanguard is beaten down, restlessness spreads. The people's annoyance, which has led so often before to outbursts -- the several mutinies in which even Aaron and Miriam took part -- breaks out again even more violently and bears witness to how unfit Moses is for his mighty calling. Indeed, this is not even in question; it is irrefutably confirmed by the testimony of Caleb, that in this position it's not merely possible but indispensable to press into the land of Canaan, []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_453}to take possession of Hebron and the terebinth-trees of Mamre,^[131](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_131){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn131}^ to capture the holy grave of Abraham and thereby create a goal as well as a centre-point and support for the entire endeavour. But, on the other hand, what harm must befall the wretched people if it is decided abruptly and recklessly to abandon the plan which Jethro -- not wholly disinterestedly but not entirely treacherously -- had suggested and which had been followed up to now?

The second year, calculated from the exodus out of Egypt to the present, wasn't yet over and before the end of it -- late enough in any case -- the possession of the fairest portion of the promised land had been envisioned; only the inhabitants, on the alert, had slammed the door shut and so, where now to turn? Having advanced far enough to the north, it was necessary to travel to the east to strike the path at last which should have been taken in the first place. But right here, in the east, lay the land of Edom encircled by mountains; a right of passage was requested which the cunning Edomites countered by suggesting they go around. To fight their way through wasn't advisable; and so they had to be satisfied with a detour, with the mountains of Edom to their left, and here the journey proceeded for the most part without difficulty; there were but a few stops -- Oboth, Iyim -- before reaching Sared brook, the waters of which flow into the Dead Sea, and then the Arnon.^[132](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_132){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn132}^ In the meantime, Miriam and Aaron had died too not long after they had risen up against Moses.

From the Arnon brook onward all went even better than before. The people saw that they were for the second time close to the goal of all their desires and in a region which offered few obstacles; here it was possible to surge forward en masse and overwhelm, despoil and expel the people who had forbidden them free passage. They advanced and the Midianites, the Moabites, and the Amorites were assailed in the finest of their habitations; indeed, the first of these (the []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_454}Midianites) were exterminated -- what Jethro had plotted to avert -- the left bank of the Jordan was taken, a few restless tribes allowed to settle there; in the meantime, however, while laws were promulgated and regulations drawn up, in the usual fashion, there was a hesitation to cross the Jordan. Amid these deliberations Moses himself died, as Aaron had died; and unless we're very much mistaken, Joshua and Caleb thought it good to bring the leadership of a limited man, over several years, to an end and to despatch him along the path of those many unfortunates whom he had despatched earlier; to bring the matter to a conclusion and to set about seriously taking possession of the entire right bank of the Jordan and the land alongside.^[133](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_133){#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn133}^

It will easily be granted that the account as here presented brings the progress of a momentous undertaking quickly and consistently into the mind's eye; and yet, credibility as well as approval won't be so immediately granted because my account has that military expedition, which the explicit letter of Holy Scripture stretches out over many years, brought to a conclusion in short order. So we have to give the reasons which we believe justify such a wide divergence; and this cannot come about in any better fashion than by directing our observations both to that stretch of land which that mass of people had to traverse, and to the amount of time which any caravan requires for such a passage, and simultaneously to compare and assess what has been handed down to us by tradition in this particular instance.

We pass over the march from the Red Sea up to Sinai; we leave all that occurred in the area of the mountain as it stands. We note merely that the bulk of the populace set out from the base of Sinai on the twentieth day of the second month in []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_455}the second year of the exodus from Egypt. From there to the wilderness of Paran they had barely forty miles to cover, a distance which a laden caravan can cover handily in five days. Permitting the entire file time to catch up now and then, along with adequate days to rest, and even allowing for further stops, they could reach the area of their destination in twelve days, which then also agrees with the Bible and with conventional opinion. Here the envoys are despatched, the entire people move only a little bit onward up to Kadesh, whereupon the envoys return after forty days and right at this point, after a move towards war goes wrong, they undertake negotiation with the Edomites. Allow as much time for this negotiation as you will, it really can't be stretched beyond thirty days. The Edomites reject the free passage and it isn't advisable for Israel to linger long in so hazardous a position. If the Canaanites had agreed with the Edomites -- one from the North, the other from the East -- to pour forth out of their mountains, the Israelites would have faced a grim situation.

The historical narrative doesn't pause even here but the decision is made at once to go around the mountain of Edom. Now the circuit around the mountain of Edom, first going south, then heading north, up to the brook Arnon is scarcely forty miles, which can be covered in five days. If we also add those forty days in which the mourning for Aaron occurred, we still come to six months out of the second year \[to account\] for every sort of delay and hesitation, over and above those marches which would bring the children of Israel successfully to the Jordan. Where then do the remaining thirty-eight years fit in?

These have given the exegetes a lot of trouble, as have the forty-one stops, among which are fifteen which the account tells us nothing about but which, interpolated into the list, have caused geographers much grief. The stopping places which have been inserted stand in a relationship, at once felicitous and fabulous, with the superfluous years. Thus, []{#Chapter_54.xhtml_page_456}sixteen places, of which we know nothing, and thirty-eight years, about which we also know nothing, give us the best opportunity to wander together with the children of Israel in the wilderness.

We juxtapose the stopping places of the historical account which became noteworthy because of events with the stopping places on the list whose empty names can then quite easily be distinguished from those which possess historical content.

[]{#Chapter_55.xhtml_page_457}What we must point out above all else at this point, however, is that the narrative takes us straight from Hazeroth to Kadesh while the list, by contrast, omits Kadesh beyond Hazeroth and only introduces it into the interpolated sequence of names after Ezion-geber and in this way brings the wilderness of Zin into contact with the small arm of the Arabian gulf of the ocean.^[135](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_135){#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn135}^ The exegetes have gone seriously astray on this point; certain of them assume that there are two Kadeshes []{#Chapter_55.xhtml_page_458}while others -- indeed, the majority of them -- accept only one; this latter opinion is not in doubt.

The historical narrative, when we've separated it painstakingly from all the inserted bits, speaks of a Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran and immediately thereafter of a Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin; the envoys are sent away from the first of these, while the whole mass of the people is sent away from the second after the Edomites have forbidden them passage through their land. From this it's clear that this is one and the same place; for the proposed march through Edom was a result of the misfired attempt to enter into the land of Canaan from this side. As is clear from other passages, the two wildernesses that are mentioned abut one another: Zin lies more northerly, Paran more to the south, while Kadesh is set as a resting-place in an oasis between the two wildernesses.

The thought would never have occurred to anyone to imagine that there were two Kadeshes were it not for the predicament arising from leading the Israelites around for so long in the wilderness. Nevertheless, those who accept only a single Kadesh and then want to account for a forty-year journey and the interpolated stopping-places are even worse; if they chart the journey on maps, they cannot contain their astonishment sufficiently in attempting to make what is impossible plain to see. For the eye is of course a finer judge of what's unsuitable than is the inner sense. Sanson shoves the fourteen inauthentic stopping-places between Sinai and Kadesh.^[136](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_136){#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn136}^ Here he can scarcely draw enough zig-zags on his map and yet, each stopping-place accounts for only two miles, a distance wholly insufficient to allow such a huge column of troops to heave itself into motion.

How populated and built up this wilderness must have been if at every two miles resting-places with designated names, if not cities and towns, were to be found! What an advantage for the commander of an army and his people! []{#Chapter_55.xhtml_page_459}Still, this profusion in the heart of the wilderness soon botches matters for the geographer. From Kadesh to Ezion-geber he finds only five stations while on the way back to Kadesh, where he has to bring them, he unfortunately finds none what- soever. He puts a few strange cities, not even named in the list, in the path of these journeying folk, in the same way as once upon a time elephants were used to cover empty places on the map. Calmet, out of a need to help himself out of odd crossroads and backtrackings, places one part of the superfluous places up against the inland sea, makes Hazeroth and Moseroth into a single place and finally brings his people by the weirdest sideways leaps to the Arnon.^[137](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_137){#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn137}^ Well, who accepts two Kadeshes distorts the lie of the land beyond measure.^[138](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_138){#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn138}^ For Nolin, the caravan dances a polonaise by which it ends up again at the Red Sea with Sinai behind it to the north.^[139](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_139){#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn139}^ It isn't possible to manifest less imagination, observation, precision and judgement than these pious, well-meaning men.

But regarded in the most exact manner, it seems highly probable that the superfluous list of stopping places was inserted to salvage the problematic forty years. For it stands written in the text, which we've followed precisely in our account, that the people, having been defeated by the Canaanites and forbidden to pass through the land of Edom, proceeded on the way to the Sea of Reeds (Red Sea) towards Ezion-geber, going around the land of Edom. This is how the error came about, that they actually came to the Red Sea after Ezion-geber, which then probably didn't yet exist, even though the text speaks of the going-around of Mount Seir along a named path, just as one says that the carter travels on Leipzig Street without his having necessarily to travel to []{#Chapter_55.xhtml_page_460}Leipzig because of this. If we've now set the superfluous places aside, we can also manage to deal with the superfluous years. We know that Old Testament chronology is artificial, that the entire reckoning of time can be broken down into discrete cycles of forty-nine years; furthermore, to produce these mystical epochs, many historical numbers have to be altered. Where to insert the six to thirty-eight years missing from a cycle more agreeably than into that very epoch which lay in such obscurity and which transpired in a chaotic and unknown patch?

Without touching at all on chronology, the hardest of all disciplines, we wish to bring its poetic aspect into consideration in support of our hypothesis.

Many numbers which can be termed round, sacred, symbolic and poetic occur in the Bible as in other ancient scriptures. The number seven seems to be dedicated to making, acting and doing, the number forty, by contrast, to contemplation and waiting, but even more especially to separation. The Flood which separates Noah and his family from the rest of the world takes forty days; after the waters have risen sufficiently they course for forty days and for the same length of time Noah keeps the door of the ark shut fast. Moses spends the same time twice on Sinai, apart from his people; the envoys remain just that long in Canaan, and so too must all the people be confirmed and consecrated by being cut off from all other peoples for so many wearisome years of the same span of time. And the significance of this number in its full value crosses over into the New Testament: Christ remains in the wilderness for forty days to wait out the tempter.^[140](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_140){#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn140}^

Had we succeeded in bringing the Children of Israel from the Sinai up to the Jordan in a shorter span of time (even if we've taken too much account of improbable and wavering delays), had we rid ourselves of so many futile years and sterile stopping-places, then the great general would have []{#Chapter_55.xhtml_page_461}been restored with all his valour intact, in contrast to what we've had to recall concerning him. The way in which God appears in these books, where He shows Himself to be both horrid and terrifying, would not have been so oppressive as well; since yet again in the Books of Joshua and Judges, and even beyond those, a purer patriarchal being emerges once more: the God of Abraham appears ever friendly to His own, even if for a long time the God of Moses filled us with revulsion and dread. We spell it out to make it clear to ourselves: as is the man, so too is his God. And so, in this connection, a few final words about the character of Moses!

Someone might exclaim to us, 'You have already, with quite excessive audacity, denied to an extraordinary man those very qualities -- the qualities of a ruler and general -- which made him admired in the past. What then marks him out? In what way does he justify so momentous a calling for himself? What gives him the boldness, despite unfavourable circumstances within and without, to press forward in such dealings, if he lacks the principal requirements, the indispensable talents, which you with such unparalleled impertinence deny him?' At this point allow us to reply. It isn't talent, it isn't skill in this or that, which makes a *man of action*; in such cases everything depends upon personality. Character has its basis in personality, not in talents. Talents can link up with character but character does not link up with them; for character everything is dispensable except for itself. And so we gladly acknowledge that Moses's personality, from that first murder onward through all the cruelties to follow to his death, offers the supremely imposing and worthy image of a man who is driven by his own nature toward what is greatest. But such an image is utterly undone if we are looking at a powerful, volatile, rash man of action wandering without rhyme or reason for forty years with a monstrous swarm of his people in so small a place and in the very sight of his goal. Merely by shortening both the route and the time which he spent there we have made up for all the nasty things we []{#Chapter_55.xhtml_page_462}ventured to say about him and have set him back up in his rightful place.

And so there remains nothing more for us to do but to repeat what we began our observations with. The Holy Scriptures are not harmed, any more than any other tradition, if we apply a critical spirit to them, if we uncover their contradictions, and how often what is original -- and better -- has been hidden, indeed, has been distorted, by later additions, interpolations and adaptations. The inner, the genuine and original, pristine value comes through all the more robustly and purely; and this it is too which everyone, wittingly or unwittingly, looks for, takes hold of and is instructed by while all that's left over he either tosses out or lets it lie where it falls.

Thus, six months in total. From this it is quite clear that the march, with whatever delays and pauses and resistance one wishes calculated in, could easily arrive at the Jordan before the end of the second year.

If the Holy Scriptures bring the primeval circumstances and the gradual development of a significant nation vividly to our minds, nevertheless, men such as Michaelis, Eichhorn, Paulus, and Heeren^[141](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_141){#Chapter_56.xhtml_chfn141}^ demonstrate the nature and immediacy of those traditions far more than we ourselves could have done. And so with respect to more recent times: we derive the greatest benefits from the travel accounts and similar documents which several Westerners -- toilsomely and delightedly and not without danger -- have brought home and shared for our rich instruction. Here we touch upon only a few men through whose eyes we've been engaged over many years in viewing those far-distant and exceedingly exotic objects.

These innumerable accounts are of course instructive after their fashion; nevertheless, they tend to confuse our imaginations -- rather than to assist them -- about the most characteristic circumstances of the East. The one-sidedness of the hostile Christian viewpoint limits us through its own limitations; only in more recent times has that view broadened a bit as we've gradually gotten to know the events of those wars through Oriental writers. At the same time we remain gratefully indebted to all those agitated pilgrims and crusaders since we owe the protection and preservation of our cultivated European situation to their religious enthusiasm and to their fierce and tireless battle against aggression from the East.

### [[]{#Chapter_58.xhtml_page_464}MARCO POLO]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Quite rightly, this outstanding man stands at the head of the list. His journey takes place in the second half of the thirteenth century; he travels to the remotest East, leads us into the strangest situations before which we stand astonished, so fabulous do they seem. Even if the details aren't immediately clear to us, the packed account of this wide-ranging traveller is skilfully designed to arouse in us a sensation of the infinite, of immensity. We find ourselves at the court of Kubla Khan, the successor to Genghis, who rules over boundless territories. For what can one make of an empire and its expanse of which, among much else, it can be said, 'Persia is a large province which consists of nine kingdoms,' and by such a standard of measurement all the rest is to be assessed? Hence, the residence in the north of China, unencompassable; the Khan's palace, a city within a city; the treasures, the weapons, heaped high; officials, soldiers and courtiers beyond all count; and each with his consort summoned to banquet upon banquet. Just such a sojourn in just such a country! The proper means for every pleasure; in particular, an army of hunters and a delight in the hunt over vast expanses. Tame leopards, trained falcons, the liveliest assistants of the hunters, countless prey in heaps. In addition, gifts lavished and received, all year long. Gold and silver, jewels, pearls, every kind of precious object in the possession of the prince and of his favourites; all the while the rest of the millions of underlings have to scrape by on counterfeit coins.^[142](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_142){#Chapter_58.xhtml_chfn142}^

Were we to betake ourselves on a journey out of the capital, we wouldn't be able to tell where the city ends because of the many suburbs. Right away we come upon residence []{#Chapter_58.xhtml_page_465}after residence, village upon village and along the majestic river a succession of pleasure gardens. All reckoned by days of travel -- and not a few at that.

The traveller commissioned by the emperor now heads toward other areas; he leads us across trackless deserts, then to provinces rich in herds, up mountain ranges, to people of wondrous customs and demeanour, and at the end he lets us gaze across ice and snow toward the eternal night of the Pole. Then suddenly he brings us as on a magic cloak down along the Indian peninsula. Beneath us we glimpse Ceylon, Madagascar, Java; our gaze strays to islands with weird names; and yet, everywhere he lets us learn so many particular qualities of human forms and customs, of landscapes, trees, plants and animals, as to vouch for the truth of his overview, even if much of it may seem fanciful as a fairy tale. Only a well-trained geographer could order and prove all this. We have had to be satisfied with a general impression since neither notes nor annotations were available to aid our first studies.

### [PIETRO DELLA VALLE^[147](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_147){#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn147}^]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Pietro della Valle was born in 1586 into an ancient Roman stock which could trace its lineage back to the noble families of the Roman Republic and at a time when all the kingdoms of Europe enjoyed a high level of intellectual culture. In Italy Tasso was still alive, though in grievous circumstances, yet his poems still had an impact on all superior minds. The art of poetry had spread so widely that improvisers of verse appeared and no young man with signs of talent could forebear to express himself in rhyme. Philology, grammar, rhetoric and style were treated in depth and so our young man grew up educated in all of these superior disciplines.

Exercises with weapons both on foot and on horseback, the noble arts of fencing and riding, served to develop his physical prowess on a daily basis, along with the strength of character with which these are intimately linked. The savage impulse of earlier crusades had by now become further refined into war as an art and the essence of knighthood, with gallantry included as well. We observe our young man paying court to several beauties, particularly in his poems, but in the end, becoming intensely unhappy when the very lady to whom he has devoted himself and with whom he seriously hopes to be united, ignores him and yields to someone unworthy. His []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_467}grief is boundless; to give himself some breathing space, he decides to go dressed as a pilgrim to the Holy Land.

He reaches Constantinople in 1614 where his aristocratic and engaging nature gains him an excellent reception. Following the pattern of his earlier studies, he flings himself right away into oriental languages, gains an overview of Turkish literature, customs and manners and then -- though not without regretting his newly won friends -- betakes himself to Egypt. He employs his sojourn there in tracing and tracking down, with the utmost seriousness, the vestiges of the world of antiquity in the modern world; from Cairo he moves on to Mount Sinai to pay his respects to the grave of St Catherine and then returns to Egypt's capital as if coming back from a pleasure trip.

Travelling away for a second time, he reaches Jerusalem in 16 days (and in this way impresses upon our imaginations a true measure of the distance between the two cities). There, while paying reverence to the Holy Sepulchre, he entreats the Saviour, as he had previously entreated St Catherine, to free him from his passion; the scales fall from his eyes and he sees that he has been a fool, she to whom he prayed earlier is really the sole person to whom such reverence is due; his aversion to other members of the female sex has vanished, he scouts around for a spouse and writes to his friends, to whom he hopes soon to return, to seek out a worthy woman for him.

After he has visited and worshipped in all the holy places, for which the recommendation of his friends in Constantinople, but in great measure the services of a Turkish porter^[148](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_148){#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn148}^ provided to accompany him, serve him admirably, he journeys onward with the most complete grasp of these circumstances, reaches Damascus, then Aleppo, where he garbs himself in Syrian dress and lets his beard grow. Here he has a significant adventure which determines his destiny. A traveller joins up with him who can't stop talking about the []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_468}beauty and kindness of a young Georgian Christian who is making a stopover in Baghdad with her family and Valle, in good Oriental fashion, falls in love with a word-picture towards which he now journeys eagerly. In her presence he feels greater affection and longing; he succeeds in winning over her mother and the father is consulted; but both parents give in only grudgingly to his tempestuous ardour; to relinquish their charming and much-loved daughter strikes them as too great a sacrifice. Finally she does become his wife and at a stroke he gains the greatest treasure both for his life and his travels. For even though he embarked on his pilgrimage equipped with the science and knowledge befitting an aristocrat and though in his observations he was as attentive as he was successful in all that directly concerns human beings and comported himself in all instances in an exemplary manner; even so, he lacked a knowledge of nature, a science which, at that time, was practised solely in a narrow circle of solemn and circumspect scholars. For this reason he can only partially satisfy the demands of his friends who ask for information about plants and trees, spices and medicaments; and yet, the lovely Maani,^[149](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_149){#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn149}^ a kind family doctor, knows about how roots and herbs and flowers grow, knows about the resins, balms, oils, seeds and woods which can be purchased and can provide an adequate account which serves to enrich her husband's observation according to local custom.

But this relationship is even more important in his life and his travels. While wholly feminine, Maani displays a character that is resolute and equal to every circumstance; she fears no danger, indeed, she looks for it and wherever she goes she behaves calmly and nobly. She mounts her horse like a man, she is skilled at reining it in and spurring it on; she remains ever a spirited and stirring companion. Equally important is the fact that while they're underway she comes into contact []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_469}with all the women^[150](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_150){#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn150}^ and while her husband is well received by the men, she is housed and maintained since she knows how to act and busy herself, as women do, with their wives.

At this point, however, the young couple come to enjoy an unfamiliar piece of good fortune for the first time in their wanderings through the empire of the Turks. They enter Persia in the thirtieth year of the reign of ῾Abbas the Second who, like Peter and Friedrich, merited the title 'the Great'.^[151](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_151){#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn151}^ After a precarious and fear-ridden youth he became aware as soon as he acceded to his rule, and in the clearest possible way, that to protect his kingdom he had to extend its boundaries and by whatever means were at hand to secure his internal dominion as well; at the same time, his every thought and wish is bent on restoring his depopulated realm with foreigners as well as on encouraging and facilitating the return of his own people through public roads and inns. He devotes revenues and patronage massively to innumerable building projects: Isfahan, ennobled as the capital, strewn with palaces and gardens, caravanserais and residences, for royal guests; a suburb constructed for the Armenians who in displaying their gratitude are shrewd enough to find continual opportunities, in acting on behalf of the royal account as well as their own, for gaining profit and tribute for the prince at the same time. Another suburb for the Georgians, yet another for the followers of the fire-worshippers, extend the city still further until at last it stretches out, as limitless as one of our imperial centres. Roman Catholic divines, especially Carmelites, are received hospitably and given protection; less so the Greek Orthodox who appear to belong amongst the enemies of both Europe and Asia since they stand under the protection of the Turks.

[]{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_470}Della Valle stayed for over a year in Isfahan and was continually active during his time there so that he could gain precise information about all conditions and circumstances. How vivid are his depictions as a result! How exact his reports! In the end, having sampled everything he was still missing the summit of all: a personal acquaintance with the emperor, whom he so deeply admired, along with a sense of how matters stood in the court, in military encounters, in the army.

In the district of Mazandaran, on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, in a quite swampy and insalubrious region, the restless, ever active prince had founded a large city, called Ferhabad, and populated it with a designated citizenry; simultaneously he had many a mountain stronghold constructed in the vicinity on the heights above a valley shaped like an amphitheatre, not far from his Russian and Turkish enemies, in a spot protected by mountain ridges. There he habitually resided and there della Valle sought him out. He arrives with Maani, is well received, is presented -- after a cautious and cunning Oriental delay -- to the king, obtains his favour and is admitted to banquets and drinking parties where he is expected above all to provide an account of European conditions, customs and religious beliefs to the well-informed but curious prince.

In the Orient generally but in Persia particularly, a certain innocence and naivety of demeanour runs through all social levels up to the foot of the throne. Naturally, at the upper level there is a distinct formality during audiences, at table and elsewhere; still, a sort of carnival laxity soon emerges in the emperor's ambience which has quite a jocular aspect. When the emperor is revelling in his gardens and pavilions nobody may step in his boots on the carpets where the court happens to be. If a Tartar prince arrives, his boot is removed but since he is unused to standing on one leg he begins to wobble and now the emperor himself steps up and holds him until the removal is complete. Towards evening the emperor stands in the middle of a circle in which golden chalices filled []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_471}with wine circulate; several of these are of average weight while a few, thanks to a reinforced base, are so heavy that the unwitting guest spills the wine, if indeed he doesn't drop the cup itself, to the enormous amusement of the ruler and others in the know. They keep on drinking in this circular fashion until one of them, no longer capable of standing upright, is led away or slips away at an opportune moment. At parting no obeisance is made to the emperor, one after another simply disappears until the ruler remains alone, listens for a while to some melancholy music and finally betakes himself to his bed. Still stranger stories are told coming from the harem where the women tickle their lord and master, wrestle with him and try to pin him to the rug while he tries amid uproarious laughter to defend himself and get his own back solely with grumbled insults.

When we hear such rollicking things about private amusements in the royal harem, we shouldn't suppose that the prince and his ministers were idle or negligent. It wasn't only the restless and active spirit of Abbas the Great which drove him to construct a second capital on the Caspian Sea. True, Ferhabad was quite favourably situated for hunting and other courtly enjoyments but, protected as it was by a mountain range, it was also close enough to the border that the emperor could hear of every movement of the Russians and the Turks, his arch-enemies, in a timely way and meet them with counter-measures. There was little to fear from the Russians at the moment, internally their realm was shaken by usurpers and princely imposters and was quite unstable. By contrast, the emperor had defeated the Turks some twelve years earlier in a most successful battle, with the result that he had nothing more to gain from that quarter; indeed, he had wrested huge tracts of land from them. Nevertheless, between such neighbours no genuine peace could ever be concluded; teasing provocations and public demonstrations kept both sides on continual alert.

Even so, at this moment 'Abbas feels impelled to quite []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_472}serious preparations for war. Utterly in keeping with immemorial style he summons his entire army onto the ex- panses of Azerbaijan and it presses forward in all its divisions, on horseback and on foot, armed with every sort of weapon; an unending baggage train along with it. For each soldier brings his wives, children and goods along as if prepared for emigration. Della Valle too brings his lovely Maani and her women, mounted on horseback, behind the army and the court, and the emperor praises him for this because by so doing he has shown himself to be a man worthy of esteem.

When an entire nation such as this sets out massively on the move, it cannot be lacking in anything which it might need at home; and for this reason salesmen and merchants of all sorts tag along too, setting up temporary bazaars everywhere and counting on brisk business. The imperial camp may be likened at all times to a city in which policing and public order are so well arranged, and penalty so cruel, that nobody need forage or commandeer, let alone plunder but rather, everything must be paid for by people great and small in cash. As a result not only the cities which lie along the route are abundantly stocked with supplies but provisions as well as necessities pour in unstoppably from more distant provinces.

Still, what strategic, what tactical operations might be expected from such organised disarray? Particularly when one learns that all divisions -- those of tribe as well as of armament -- mingle indiscriminately on the battlefield and -- without anyone assigned to front, middle or rear, but just as chance has it -- fight in a welter of confusion. For this reason, a fortunate victory can be easily undone and a single lost battle can determine the fate of a kingdom for years to come.

On this occasion, however, no such frightful clash of fists or of weapons takes place. True, they press with inconceivable hardship through the mountains; but they delay, the foe will perish in the devastated countryside. Panicked alarms, hollow proclamations of victory, reel back and forth; fervently rejected, proudly rebuffed peace conditions, feigned []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_473}pugnacity, crafty stalling manoeuvres at first delay peace and then make it possible. And now, on the emperor's command, and on pain of punishment, everyone moves out without any further duress or danger than what he has already encountered on the packed and thronging way and returns home at once.

We encounter della Valle again at Qazvin, close to the court, and dissatisfied that the campaign against the Turks came to so speedy a conclusion. For we have to regard him not simply as an inquisitive traveller, as an adventurer blown hither and yon by happenstance; on the contrary, he cultivates his goals and pursues them relentlessly. At that period Persia was truly a country for foreigners; the generosity of Abbas, extended over long years, attracted many a bold spirit, it wasn't yet an age of formal embassies, skilful travellers could make themselves valued. At an earlier period, Shirley, an Englishman, had already taken it upon himself to play the intermediary between East and West.^[152](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_152){#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn152}^ And so too della Valle, independent, wealthy, aristocratic, cultured and well recommended, gains access to the court and strives to foment hostilities against the Turks. He is motivated by the same Christian sentiment which stirred the Crusaders; he had seen, and had partly suffered, the mistreatment of pious pilgrims at the Holy Sepulchre, and all western nations were anxious that Constantinople be harried from the East. 'Abbas, however, mistrusted the Christians; thinking only of their own advantage, they had never supported him. And now he had come to an understanding with the Turks. Even so, della Valle doesn't relent but seeks to forge a tie between Persia and the Black Sea Cossacks. He comes back to Isfahan intending to settle there and promote Roman Catholicism. He first gathers his wife's relatives around him, then draws []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_474}still more Christians from Georgia, he adopts a Georgian orphan girl, he stays with the Carmelites, and has nothing less in mind than to receive a piece of land from the emperor in order to found a new Rome.

At this point the emperor himself appears once again in Isfahan; envoys from all parts of the globe stream hither. Mounted on horseback, on the grandest of all squares, in the company of his soldiers and eminent retainers as well as distinguished guests, the noblest of whom are present on horseback with full cortège, the ruler grants jocular audiences; gifts are presented with swaggering grandeur but are quickly and arrogantly scorned, then haggled over in the manner of Jewish merchants, and in this way majesty hovers continually between the extremes of the loftiest and the basest. Later, now secretly sequestered in his harem, now acting before all eyes, thrusting himself into every public matter, the emperor manifests his presence in tireless and headstrong dealings.

Throughout all this, however, a certain freewheeling mentality in matters of religion is apparent. Nevertheless, no Muslim can be converted to Christianity; and he no longer takes any pleasure in conversions to Islam, which he once favoured. One is more or less free to believe and practise what one will. Thus, the Armenians celebrate the Baptism of the Cross in their splendid district, through which the river Sandarud runs, in the most sumptuous manner.^[153](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_153){#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn153}^ Not only will the emperor attend this function with a huge retinue but even here he cannot leave off issuing orders and directions. First of all he discusses with the clergy what plans they may have in mind, then he springs back and forth, rides hither and yon, commanding order and calm on the procession with the same exactitude that he uses on his troops. When the ceremony has concluded, he assembles the clerics and other []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_475}important men about him and discusses all sorts of religious opinions and customs with them. This free and open attitude towards believers of other persuasions isn't merely the emperor's personal trait; it may be found generally among the Shi'is. These adherents of 'Ali, who was originally barred from the caliphate and then murdered after finally acceding to it, can be considered in many respects an oppressed Muslim faction; their hatred is directed principally against the Sunnis who recognise and revere the caliphs who intervened between Muhammad and 'Ali.^[154](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_154){#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn154}^ The Turks subscribe to this \[Sunni\] belief and so a gulf as much political as religious divides the Persians and the Turks. Though the Shi'is hate the members of their own religious community who differ from them in matters of doctrine, they are indifferent to members of other faiths and accord them, far more than to their actual adversaries, a certain favoured acceptance.

Even so, it's bad enough! For liberality groans under the pressures of the emperor's arbitrary wilfulness. Whether to populate or depopulate a kingdom is pretty much the same to a despotic will. 'Abbas, slinking around the countryside in disguise, overhears the grumbling of some Armenian women and takes such personal umbrage that he inflicts the cruellest collective punishments on the male inhabitants of the village. Terror and anxiety spread along the banks of the Sandarud; the suburb of Khalfa, once cheered by imperial participation in their solemn rite, is now plunged into the profoundest grief.

And so we are continually sharing the emotions of great peoples alternately exalted and debased by despotism. We are amazed to what a high level of security and well-being 'Abbas []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_476}as sole ruler raised the kingdom and at the same time ascribe such durability to this circumstance that the weakness, folly and inconsequential behaviour of his successors could run the empire completely into the ground only after ninety years; and yet, then we surely have to bring out the obverse of this impressive image.

Since every rule by one man rejects all influence and has to preserve the ruler's personality in the strictest security, it follows inevitably that a despot must continually suspect treachery, sense danger everywhere, and even fear violence from every quarter, simply because it is through violence alone that he himself holds claim to his lofty position. As a result he is jealous of everyone other than himself who inspires esteem and confidence or displays dazzling skills or collects treasures and appears to rival him in his activity. Nevertheless, it is the successor who in every respect inspires suspicion most. It is the mark of a lofty spirit in a royal father if he can gaze without envy upon his son to whom, not long hence, nature will irretrievably transfer -- without any consent from their strong-willed owner -- all the possessions and acquisitions he himself once held. Conversely, the son is enjoined as the noble, refined and tasteful person he is, to moderate his expectations, conceal his wishes and not even seem to snatch at paternal destiny prematurely. Still and all, where is human nature so pure and grand, so serenely willing to wait-and-see, so joyously active under imperative conditions, that in such a situation, a father might fail to complain about a son, a son about a father! Even if both of them are angelically upright, people will whisper in their ears and come between them, inadvertence will be converted into crime, semblance to hard proof. How many examples does history provide us! We have only to call to mind the deplorable domestic labyrinth in which we saw King Herod trapped. It isn't only those closest to him who keep him in wavering peril but a remarkable child, foretold by prophecy, arouses his anxieties and prompts a widespread atrocity just before his death.

[]{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_477}Thus the same fate befell 'Abbas the Great. Sons and grandsons fell under suspicion and gave cause for suspicion; one of them, quite innocent, was murdered while another, only partly innocent, was blinded. This latter said: 'You have not only taken the light from me but from the empire itself.'

To such wretched crimes of despotism yet another such act becomes unavoidably linked and in this way inadvertent and unforeseen acts of violence and lawlessness proliferate. Every human being is governed by his habits, he will comport himself moderately only when hemmed in by exterior strictures and moderation itself becomes habit. But quite the opposite occurs in the case of the despot; an unhindered will mounts of its own accord and if not checked from outside, surges towards the absolutely limitless. Here we discover the solution to the riddle of how out of an admirable young prince whose early years of rule are graced with blessing, a tyrant little by little emerges, to the blight of the world and the destruction of his own kin (who themselves are compelled, more often than not, to come up with an effective remedy for this torment).

Unfortunately, that striving for the absolute which is innate to man and demands all his strength turns even more terrible in its effects when a physical stimulus is joined to it. This results in the most extreme intensification which is resolved only, luckily enough, in complete numbness. We mean the excessive use of wine which momentarily shatters the paltry boundaries of tranquil righteousness and equity, which even the tyrant cannot as a human being fully repudiate, and wreaks a havoc without bounds. Should we apply what we've said to 'Abbas the Great who throughout his fifty-year reign exalted himself as the sole wielder of will in his vast and populous kingdom; should we consider him, free-spirited, sociable and good-tempered, then led astray through suspicion, vexation and -- worst of all -- a twisted love of righteousness, and inflamed by heavy drinking, and, to cap it off, wracked by a vile and incurable bodily ailment []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_478}and reduced to despair -- should we consider all this, we may concede that those who put a stop to so horrific a presence on earth are worthy of our forgiveness if not our praise. We laud those cultured people and think them blessed whose monarch rules himself with a noble ethical awareness; felicitous too are those moderate, constitutionally limited governments which the ruler himself has every reason to love and promote because they relieve him of many a responsibility and preserve him from many a regret.

Not only the prince, however, but everyone who wins a share of the supreme power through trust, favour or usurpation, runs the danger of overstepping the circle which law and custom, fellow feeling, conscience, religion and tradition have traced for the happiness and well-being of the human race. Hence, ministers and favourites, the representatives of the people, and the people itself, should be on their guard that they too not be sucked into the whirlpool of unrestricted will and bring both themselves and others irretrievably to destruction.

Returning now to our traveller, we find him in an uneasy situation. Notwithstanding his great predilection for the Orient, della Valle must feel in the end that he is dwelling in a land in which no further success is to be expected, a land in which with the purest will and the most strenuous activity a new Rome cannot be founded. His wife's relatives are not constrained by family ties for a moment; after having dwelt in Isfahan in the most intimate family circle, they deem it more advantageous to move back to the Euphrates and take up their accustomed way of life once again. The rest of the Georgians prove listless; even the Carmelites, for whom the great project must lie especially close to their hearts, can get neither interest nor support out of Rome.

Della Valle's zeal cools; he decides to return to Europe, but unfortunately, at the least favourable season. It strikes him as intolerable to go by way of the desert; he resolves to travel via India. At this very moment, however, military []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_479}manoeuvres begin between the Portuguese, the Spanish and the English over Hormuz, the most important trading-place, and 'Abbas believes that it is in his interest to get involved. The emperor decides to fight against his troublesome Portuguese neighbours and to expel them, and then to thwart the intentions of the ever helpful English, perhaps through intrigue and delay, and to seize their profits for himself.

At this critical juncture, that startling and singular sensation, which sets people mightily at odds with themselves, surprises our travellers -- that sense of great remoteness from our homeland at the very moment when, ill at ease in foreign parts, we are heading home, and in fact, yearning to be there already. In such circumstances it's almost impossible to ward off impatience; even our friend is bestirred and his robust character, his firm and noble self-assurance deceive him as to the difficulties which lie before him. His audacity in the face of all odds has in the past enabled him to overcome every obstacle, to realise all plans; he flatters himself that he will enjoy the same good fortune and since a return through the desert appears intolerable, he resolves to go via India, accompanied by his lovely Maani and her foster-daughter Mariuccia.

Many troubling events occur, harbingers of danger ahead; still, he travels through Persepolis and Shiraz, ever on the alert, precisely noting and recording objects, manners and local customs. In this way he reaches the Persian Gulf only to discover, as might have been expected, that the harbours are closed and all ships confiscated, in keeping with wartime practices. In a highly insalubrious spot on the coast he comes upon an encampment of Englishmen whose caravans are halted as well while they await a favourable opportunity. He is warmly received and joins up with them, sets his tent up next to theirs along with a palm-thatched hut for great comfort. And here a kindly star seems to shine down upon him! His marriage had been childless; to the great joy of both man and wife, Maani proclaims herself expectant. But now he falls ill, a poor diet and unhealthy air work their worst []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_480}upon him, and unfortunately, upon Maani too; she gives birth prematurely and remains feverish. Even without medical assistance, she retains her staunch character for a while yet but then, feeling her end upon her, she yields in pious serenity, asks to be borne out of the palm-hut and into the tent and there, with Mariuccia holding the sacred candles and della Valle performing the traditional prayers, she expires in his arms. She was twenty-three years old.

To soften so monstrous a loss he decides firmly and irrevocably to bring her remains back for burial to Rome. He is lacking in resins, balsams and precious herbs but luckily he discovers a shipment of the best camphor, which can preserve a body, if artfully applied by skilled individuals.

As a result of this, however, he takes on the greatest hindrances, in that he will have henceforth to soothe or pay off now the superstitions of camel-drivers, now the greedy prejudices of officials, now the vigilance of customs agents, through the entire journey ahead.

We travel with him to Lar, the capital of Laristan, where he finds better air and a good reception; and the Persians are expected to capture Hormuz. But their victory avails him not. He is forced back yet again to Shiraz until at last he travels to India on an English ship. Here we find that his comportment is as it was earlier. His solid courage, his knowledge, his noble traits afford him an easy entrée and gracious reception everywhere. Nevertheless, at the last he is again forced back to the Persian Gulf and compelled to travel home through the desert.

There he endures all the rigours he had dreaded. Plundered by tribal chieftains, extorted by customs officials, robbed by the desert Arabs and everywhere, even in Christian regions, cheated and hindered, he manages even so to bring back curiosities and precious objects galore to Rome, with the strangest and most precious of all being the body of his beloved Maani. Once there he performs magnificent obsequies at Ara Coeli; and when he climbs down into the grave to bestow the []{#Chapter_60.xhtml_page_481}final honours upon her, there are two maidens beside him: Silvia, presumably the daughter who has grown up during his absence, and Tinatin di Ziba, whom formerly we knew as Mariuccia, both of whom are around fifteen years old. He now decides to marry the second of these, who has been a faithful companion on the journey and his sole consolation since the death of his wife, and to do so against the wishes of his relatives -- and indeed, of the Pope himself -- who have nobler and wealthier connections in mind for him. Now, resplendent for several years yet, he bestirs his fierce and bold and daring nature, and not without clashes, danger and vexation, manages to leave behind at his death, which comes in his sixty-sixth year, a swarming progeny.

### [APOLOGY]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

It is worth noting that everyone favours the way in which he arrives at knowledge and insight over all other ways and wants to encourage and initiate those who come after him to follow the same ways. For this reason I've presented Peter della Valle at some length, for he was the traveller through whom the characteristic features of the Orient first came home to me with great clarity; and I can presume to say that I first gained the footing and foundation for my *West-Eastern Divan* through his presentation. May this serve others as a stimulus, in a time which is so rich in papers and pamphlets, to pore over a volume through which they may arrive firmly in a realm of great significance, a world which may seem superficially altered but which is fundamentally the very same which once presented itself to this exceptional man in his day and age.

</div>

The page count of the studies we've printed up till now reminds us to proceed more cautiously and with fewer digressions. For this reason we speak of the above-named, and quite excellent, man merely in passing. It is remarkable to consider various nations in their travellers. We find the English, amongst whom we pass over Shirley and Herbert very reluctantly; then the Italians; and lastly, the French. Now let a German step forth here in his strength and dignity. Unfortunately he teamed up with a man on his journey to the Persian court who appears as more of an adventurer than an envoy but behaved in both guises pigheadedly, clumsily and indeed, foolishly.^[156](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_156){#Chapter_62.xhtml_chfn156}^ The uprightness of the excellent Olearius was not misled by all this; he provides us with enormously enjoyable and instructive travel accounts which are all the more valuable because he arrived in Persia only a few years after della Valle and just after the death of 'Abbas the Great; upon his return he made Sa'di the Excellent known to Germans through his skilled and delightful translation. We break off unwillingly here for we also want to express our profound gratitude to this man for the great good we owe him. We find ourselves in a similar situation with respect to the following two men whose merits we can only superficially touch upon as well.

### [[]{#Chapter_63.xhtml_page_483}TAVERNIER AND CHARDIN^[157](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_157){#Chapter_63.xhtml_chfn157}^]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

The first of these, a goldsmith and jeweller, presses his way with shrewd deliberation into the courts of the Orient all the while displaying the precious and exquisite wares he promotes, and is everywhere conscious of where he should be and where he may go. He reaches the diamond mines of India and after a hazardous trip home, receives a rather chilly welcome. His posthumous writings are extremely informative and yet, he is not so much obstructed during his lifetime by his countryman, successor and rival Chardin as besmirched in public opinion after his death. The latter, who at the very outset of his travels must grapple with the severest obstacles, grasps just how to work expertly upon the mentality of oriental potentates and plutocrats, which fluctuates between magnanimity and meanness, and knows also how to minister in manifold ways to their insatiable craving for fresh gems and exotic goldsmithery -- no matter how great the treasures they already possess -- and as a result he returns home not lacking in good fortune and standing.

The intelligence, equanimity, proficiency, perseverance, charming comportment and steadfastness of both of these men are admirable beyond measure; every man of the world could take them as models to esteem on his own journey through life. And yet, they possessed two advantages not granted to everyone: they were at once Protestants and Frenchmen -- qualities which when found together are capable of producing supremely capable individuals.

### [[]{#Chapter_64.xhtml_page_484}RECENT AND MOST RECENT TRAVELLERS]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

There is no need here to touch upon what we owe to the eighteenth and even the nineteenth centuries. In recent times the English have enlightened us about the most unknown regions. The kingdom of Kabul, ancient Gedrosia and Caramania have become accessible to us.^[158](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_158){#Chapter_64.xhtml_chfn158}^ Who could restrain his gaze so as not to skim over the Indus and recognise the huge activity which grips it daily on all sides? And so, thus encouraged, the yearning for farther and deeper knowledge of languages must continually spread. If we consider what strides both mind and body have made to reach from the confined Hebrew and Rabbinic sphere to the breadth and depth of Sanskrit, one really has to rejoice at being a witness to this progress over so many years. Even wars which obstruct and destroy so much have brought many additions to basic insight. The territories on both banks of the Indus, from the Himalayas on down, which formerly were merely fabulous to us, appear clearly now in relation to the rest of the world. We can now extend our view as we please, and as our powers and opportunities permit, across the subcontinent down to Java and learn the most specific details. In this way one door after another lies open to younger friends of the Orient -- to get to know the mysteries of that primal world, the defects of a singular cast of mind and a wretched religion, alongside the splendour of its poetry, in which pure humanity, noble manners, serenity and love take flight; to take comfort in the quarrels of castes, in fantastic monsters of religion and in abstruse mysticism; and in the end to come to the conviction that, even so, in all this, the salvation of humanity is preserved.

### []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_485}TEACHERS [DEPARTED OR STILL LIVING]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

It is a difficult, almost impossible task to furnish an exact account of those from whom we learned this or that during the course of our life and our studies, as well as of how we were encouraged not solely by friends and comrades but also by adversaries and foes. Even so, I feel impelled to name several men to whom I owe particular gratitude.

#### *Jones*^[159](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_159){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn159}^ {#Chapter_65.xhtml_ch65-1 .h4}

This man's merits are so renowned around the world and so thoroughly celebrated in more than one place that nothing remains for me but to acknowledge generally that I have striven to draw every possible benefit from his endeavours. Nevertheless, I do want to indicate one aspect which seems especially remarkable to me.

In keeping with the true English way of education, grounded in Greek and Latin literature to such an extent that he was not only capable of appreciating them justly but could work in them as well, and also fully conversant with European literature, once having strayed into Oriental literatures, he enjoyed the fine twofold gift of being able to esteem each nation on its own most characteristic merits while at the same time discovering everywhere that beauty and goodness which each necessarily shared with the other.

He had considerable difficulty in communicating his insights, even so. The predilection of his countrymen for old classical literature stood principally in his way. To observe him closely is easily to become aware that, clever man that he was, he sought to link the unknown with the known, and that which deserved to be appreciated with that which already was appreciated. He concealed his partiality for Oriental []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_486}poetic art and with nimble modesty, gave mostly such examples as he could set beside the most admired Latin and Greek poems; he employed the ancient rhythmic forms to make the tender audacities of the Orient accessible to Classicists. Nevertheless, he must have experienced considerable vexation not only from Classical philologists but from patriots; the contempt for Oriental poetry pained him; this glimmers clearly forth from his half-ironical essay, merely two pages long, 'Arabs*, sive de Poësi Anglorum Dialogus*', at the conclusion of his work on the Asiatic art of poetry.^[160](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_160){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn160}^ Here, with manifest bitterness, he shows us how ridiculous Milton and Pope would look in Oriental garb; from which it follows that, as we have said more than once, every poet has to be viewed, known and assessed in his own language and in the distinctive circumstances of his time and customs.

#### *Eichhorn*^[161](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_161){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn161}^ {#Chapter_65.xhtml_ch65-2 .h4}

With delighted recognition I note that in my current labours I am still using the same copy of his edition of Jones's Works with which this much esteemed man honoured me some forty-two years ago, when we still had him here among us and received so much that was beneficial and instructive from his mouth. I followed his course of instruction the whole time in silence and in the final days I was immensely pleased to receive, complete and from his own hand, the extremely important work, which elucidates the Prophets^[162](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_162){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn162}^ and their circumstances for us. For what is more delightful, for the man of calm understanding as well as for the excitable poet, than to see how those God-possessed men regarded their agitated milieu and signalled the wondrous-solemn thing that []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_487}went forth castigating, warning, comforting and exalting hearts on high.

With these few remarks may my grateful and lifelong esteem for this worthy man be faithfully expressed.

#### *Lorsbach*^[163](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_163){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn163}^ {#Chapter_65.xhtml_ch65-3 .h4}

To call the doughty Lorsbach to mind is also an obligation here. He was older when he came into our circle where he in no way found any congenial place; even so, he willingly gave me sound information on everything about which I asked him, just as long as it lay within the sphere of his expertise, which he frequently circumscribed too sharply.

Initially it struck me as wondrous to discover in him no particular friend of Oriental poetry; and yet, the same thing could happen to anyone who lovingly and enthusiastically spends his time and effort on an enterprise and only at the end fails to find the expected gain. Then too, old age is the time in which a man's pleasure in things dwindles just when he needs it most. His understanding and his integrity were equally gladsome and I always recall the hours which I spent with him with pleasure.

#### *Von Diez* {#Chapter_65.xhtml_ch65-4 .h4}

The prelate von Diez^[164](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_164){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn164}^ had a significant influence on my studies which I gratefully acknowledge. At the time when I was occupying myself more closely with Oriental literature, []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_488}the *Book of Kabus* fell into my hands and seemed so important to me that I devoted a great deal of time to it and urged several friends to take notice of it. Through a traveller I offered this estimable man, to whom I owe so much instruction, a courteous greeting. In return he was friendly enough to send me his little book on tulips. I arranged to have a small area on silken paper adorned with a splendid golden flower border and there I wrote:

::: top
How one strolls with prudence on the earth,

Whether up mountains or descending from the throne,

And how one handles people as one handles horses --

All this is what the king teaches his son.

We know this now through You who bestowed it on us;

Now you join the tulip's blossom to it,

And if the golden frame didn't limit me

Where would all you've done for us conclude?
:::

And so an epistolary conversation began which this eminent man continued faithfully, in an almost illegible handwriting, amid all his pains and sufferings, to the end.

Since I had been until then familiar with the manners and history of the Orient only in a general fashion, and utterly unfamiliar with its languages, such a friendship was of the greatest importance to me. Since a prescribed and methodical approach for the sake of mere momentary comprehension would have demanded an expenditure of time and energy searching in books, I turned to him in puzzling instances and always got satisfactory and helpful replies to my questions. These letters of his certainly deserve to be published on account of their contents and displayed as a memorial to his learning and benevolence. Since I knew of his strict and idiosyncratic nature, I restrained myself from approaching him from a certain angle; even so, when I expressed a desire to get to know the character of Nasreddin Hoja, the merry travel and camp companion of Timur the World-Conqueror, []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_489}he was obliging enough -- quite against his own inclination -- to translate some anecdotes for me. From these it emerged, however, that many a lively tale, which Westerners treat after their own fashion, derives from the Orient, even though the authentic tint, the true and actual tone, have been largely lost in the transmission.

Since the manuscript of this book is now in the Royal Library in Berlin, it would be extremely desirable for a master of this discipline to give us a translation. It might be best if this were to be done in the Latin language so that scholars could get a good grasp of it first of all. Then a nice abridged version might be prepared for the German public.

That I shared and derived benefit from my friend's other writings, such as the *Denkwürdigkeiten des Orients*,^[165](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_165){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn165}^ and the rest, the present book bears witness; it's a bit trickier to admit that his quarrelsomeness, which wasn't always commendable, was very helpful to me as well. Nevertheless, one has only to call his university years to mind, when he raced to the duelling ground whenever two masters or seniors essayed skill and dexterity against one another, nor can anyone deny that on such occasions, he witnessed strengths and weaknesses which perhaps would have remained hidden forever from a student.

The author of the book *Kabus*, Kay-Ka'us, king of the Daylamites who inhabited the mountainous land of Gilan, which ends to the south of the Caspian Sea, will become doubly dear to us as we get to know him better.^[166](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_166){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn166}^ As a crown []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_490}prince carefully reared for the freest and most active sort of life, he left his homeland both to form his character and to prove himself in the far-flung East.

Shortly after the death of Mahmud, whose many praise-worthy deeds we have mentioned, he came to Ghazna, was warmly welcomed by Mahmud's son Mas'ud and as a result of many services in both war and peace, married one of his sisters. At a court where not long before Firdowsi had written the *Shah-nameh*, where a large assemblage of poets and talented men still flourished, and where the new ruler, bold and bellicose as his father, appreciated scintillating society, Kay-Ka'us was able to find the most valuable scope for further self-improvement on his wanderings.

But we must first speak of his education. His father had handed him over to an excellent teacher to push his physical development to the utmost. This teacher brought the son home skilled in all knightly exercises: shooting, riding, shooting while riding, spear-throwing, swinging the mallet and striking the ball most effectively. After all of this was successfully accomplished and the king seemed to be satisfied, even praising the teacher to the skies, he added: 'I have just one thing to remind you of. You've instructed my son in everything for which he requires some external device; without a horse he cannot ride, without a bow he cannot shoot, what good is his arm when he has no lance, and what good is a game without a mallet and ball? You haven't taught him the one thing for which he needs only himself and which is the most necessary and which no one else can help him to do.' The teacher stood ashamed; he realised that the prince was unable to swim. Despite some reluctance on the prince's part, this too was imparted, and it saved his life when he went on pilgrimage to Mecca with a great crowd of pilgrims and was one of a few to escape when they were wrecked on the Euphrates.

That he had been educated to the same high level in intellectual matters is attested by the good reception he enjoyed at the court of Ghazna; such that he was named one of the []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_491}prince's companions -- a high honour at the time -- because he must have been accomplished, as well as genial and intelligent enough, to give a good account of himself on all occasions.

On account of powerful neighbours, greedy for conquest, the succession in Gilan was uncertain; uncertain too was the very control of the kingdom. Finally, after the death of his royal father, himself once deposed then reinstated, Kay-Ka'us acceded to the throne in the fullness of his wisdom and with steely resignation to the possible consequences of his action; in his old age, foreseeing that his son Gilan Shah would have an even more dangerous situation than his own, he wrote this remarkable book in which he addresses his son 'so that he might inform him in the arts and the sciences on a twofold basis, either to gain his livelihood through an art should he find himself reduced to need by fate, or in the event that he may not need an art to gain his livelihood, that he may at least be well instructed in the fundamentals of every matter, should he remain in majesty.'

Had such a book come in our day and age into the hands of those noble émigrés who often, with exemplary resignation, sustain themselves with the work of their own hands, how comforting it would have been to them!

That such an excellent, indeed invaluable, book is no longer known may have as its cause that the author published it at his own expense and the firm of Nicolai took it on only on commission; whereby even for such a work in a bookshop a lag can occur. Nevertheless, so that the father-land may know what riches await it, we list the contents of the chapters here and we ask such reliable daily papers as the *Morgenblatt* and the *Gesellschafter* to make the anecdotes and stories -- as edifying as they are delightful -- along with the great, incomparable maxims which this work contains, widely known in the interim.

In conclusion, a brief chronological recapitulation. King Kay-Ka'us acceded to his rule in approximately 450 ah (1058 ad), reigned until 473 ah (1080 ad), married a daughter of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna. His son Gilan Shah, for whom he wrote this work, was despoiled of his territories. Little is known of his life, and nothing of his death.^[168](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_168){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn168}^ See Diez's translation (Berlin, 1811).

The bookshop which has taken over this previously announced work in press or on commission is requested to make itself known. A low price will ease its diffusion, which is highly desirable.

#### []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_494}*Von Hammer*^[169](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_169){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn169}^ {#Chapter_65.xhtml_ch65-5 .h4}

My little book makes plain in all its parts how indebted I am to this estimable man. I'd been aware of Hafiz and his poetry for a long time but whatever literature, travel reports, journalism and the like brought before me gave me no conception, no glimpse, of the worth and merit of this extraordinary man. But when at last, in the spring of 1813, the complete translation of all his works reached me, I grasped his innermost nature with particular affection and sought to position myself in relation to him through my own work. This amiable occupation helped me through some difficult times and allowed me to taste the fruits of hard-won peace in the most delightful of ways.

For several years I'd been generally aware of the flourishing enterprise of the *Fundgruben*^[170](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_170){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn170}^ but now came the time when I might profit from it. Over numerous pages this work interpreted and simultaneously aroused and satisfied the needs of the time; for me the experience showed how true it is that in every field we are supported by our contemporaries in a most excellent fashion so long as one avails himself of their merits with gratitude and affection. Learned men teach us about the past, they provide the vantage point on which the actions of a moment transpire, they point out the next way forward which we must tread. Happily the aforementioned splendid work is still being continued with the same zeal; and even if one comes from behind in his investigations []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_495}in this field, one always comes back with pleasure and renewed interest to what has been offered to us here in fresh and useful form on so many pages.

Nevertheless, I have to admit that this important collection would have helped me more expeditiously if the editor (who, to be sure, works and contributes only for accomplished scholars) had paid some attention to lay readers and amateurs as well and prefaced, if not all, yet several of the essays with a brief introduction to the conditions of past epochs, the personalities, and the locales. Certainly those eager to learn would have been thereby spared a great deal of tedious and distracted rummaging about.

Still, everything which formerly remained a mere desideratum has now become ours in ample measure through this inestimable work which transmits the history of Persian poetry to us. For I gladly acknowledge that in 1814, when the *Göttinger Anzeige* made the first preliminary announcement of its contents, I immediately organised and rearranged my studies in accord with the rubrics that were given, and in this way gained a considerable advantage. But when the impatiently awaited work finally appeared in its entirety, one landed all at once in a world that was familiar, the conditions of which could be clearly discerned and considered in individual detail, where otherwise things would have been glimpsed only in the most general outlines through shifting layers of fog.

May my use of this work find some measure of favour, as well as my intention of also luring those who might have set this accumulated treasure off to one side over the course of their lives.

Certainly we now possess a foundation upon which Persian literature can be splendidly and visibly established; and by its example, other literatures may win status and support. It remains extremely desirable, nevertheless, that the chronological arrangement be preserved rather than making an attempt at a systematic presentation according to the []{#Chapter_65.xhtml_page_496}various genres. For the Oriental poets everything is too mixed up together to enable anyone to single out the individual aspect; only the character of the period and that of the poet in his period are instructive and have a quickening effect on everyone; as the discussion has transpired here may it ever remain.

May the merits of the radiant Shirin and of the darling and gravely edifying clover-leaf, which brings us delight at the very end of our work, be acknowledged everywhere.^[171](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_171){#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn171}^

### [TRANSLATIONS^[172](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_172){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn172}^]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Since Germans approach the Orient ever more closely through translations of all sorts, we feel impelled at this point to adduce a matter which though certainly well enough known cannot be repeated too often.

There are three kinds of translation. The first makes a foreign country known to us on our own terms; here a plain prose translation works best. While prose completely effaces the idiosyncrasies of every sort of poetic art and even drags poetic enthusiasm down to the lowest level, it still performs []{#Chapter_66.xhtml_page_497}the greatest service at the outset for it surprises us with foreign excellence in the very midst of our domestic and common life as a nation, without our even realising what has happened to us, and conferring a more exalted state of mind as it edifies. Such an effect will be produced in any age by Luther's translation of the Bible.

Had the *Nibelungenlied* been turned into smooth prose right from the start and made into a *Volksbuch*,^[173](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_173){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn173}^ much might have been achieved; the strange, grave, dark and spooky mindset of the medieval knights would have spoken to us with its full force. Whether or not this is still advisable or even doable can best be assessed by those who have devoted themselves to such antiquarian pursuits.

A second epoch now follows in which there is a concern to transpose oneself into a foreign country but in fact only by adapting foreign notions to one's own particular perspective. I'd call such a period *parodistic* in the strict sense of the word.^[174](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_174){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn174}^ It's usually men of wit who feel drawn to this kind of activity. The French avail themselves of this approach in translating all poetic works; hundreds of examples can be found in Delille's versions.^[175](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_175){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn175}^ Just as the Frenchman makes foreign words palatable to himself, he proceeds in like manner with feelings, thoughts, even objects; for every exotic fruit he fashions a surrogate which has sprouted from his own native soil.

Wieland's translations are of this sort.^[176](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_176){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn176}^ He had an odd sensibility and personal taste whereby he drew near to antiquity and to foreign lands only insofar as he felt comfortable there. This eminent man can be seen as a representative of his epoch. He had an extraordinary impact in that whatever delighted him, as well as the manner in which he assimilated []{#Chapter_66.xhtml_page_498}and transmitted it, struck his contemporaries too as pleasant and enjoyable.

Because one cannot tarry for too long in either the complete or the incomplete but rather, one transformation must constantly follow upon another, we then came to experience the third era which can be reckoned the final as well as the highest. This is the era in which an attempt was launched to make the translation identical to the original, not in such a way that the translation supplants the original but rather stands in the same place.

At first this type met with the greatest resistance. For the translator who sticks closely to his original more or less abandons the originality of his own nation; and so a third element comes into being for which the public must gradually develop a taste.

Voß,^[177](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_177){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn177}^ who cannot be too highly praised, couldn't please the public at first but then bit by bit it learned to hear his new approach and to feel comfortable with it. Now whoever surveys what came to pass, what versatility appeared among the Germans; what rhetorical, rhythmic, metrical advantages now stand within the grasp of clever and talented young people; how Ariosto, Tasso, Shakespeare and Calderon have been brought before us as 'germanised' foreigners twice and even three times already -- such a person may hope that literary history will state without hindrance who was the first person to carve out this path despite so many obstacles.

Von Hammer's works for the most part show a similar approach to Oriental masterpieces. His approximation of their outer form is especially commendable. The incomparably superior passages of his translation of Firdowsi (which the aforementioned friend gave us) are obvious when compared with those of an adaptor,^[178](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_178){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn178}^ some of which can be read []{#Chapter_66.xhtml_page_499}in the *Fundgruben*. We consider this manner of reconfiguring a poet to be one of the sorriest mistakes which an industrious and otherwise skilled translator could make.

But since those three eras return and repeat themselves in every literature -- indeed, the three approaches can be in practice concurrently -- a prose translation of the *Shah-nameh* and the works of Nizami would still have a place; it could be used for skimming the text for its general sense. We could enjoy the historical, the fabulous and the ethical aspects in a general way and gradually familiarise ourselves with the attitudes and modes of thought until we could finally be fully intimate with them.

We should keep in mind the very pronounced applause which we Germans accorded to such a translation of the *Shakuntala* and we could attribute the delight which it gave us to that very plain prose into which the poem had been dissolved.^[179](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_179){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn179}^ Now, however, it is high time that we were given a translation of the third sort, which would correspond to the various dialects and the different rhythmic, metrical and prose styles of the original and which might make this poem in all its distinctive strangeness both freshly enjoyable and familiar to us. Since a manuscript of this immortal work is available in Paris, a German living there could win undying renown amongst us by taking this task on.

The English translator of the *Cloud Messenger*, the *Megadhuta*, is also deserving of all honour since a first encounter with a work of this sort marks a date in our lives forever.^[180](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_180){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn180}^ In fact, his translation is really from the second era; it is periphrastic and supplementary; with its iambic pentameter it cajoles the north-eastern ear and mind. By contrast I am indebted to Kosegarten for a few verses taken directly from []{#Chapter_66.xhtml_page_500}the original which, to be sure, permit a quite different interpretation.^[181](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_181){#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn181}^ The Englishman was pleased to transpose motifs, which is something the well-schooled aesthetic eye discovers at once and disapproves.

We'll explain briefly why we term the third era the last one. A translation which tries to identify with the original comes close to an interlinear version in the end; it makes an understanding of the original much easier. We are led to the fundamental text -- indeed, we are driven to it -- and so at last the entire circle within which the approximation of the foreign and the domestic, the known and the unknown move, is drawn to a close.

### [FINAL CONCLUSION!]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

Cognoscenti and well-disposed friends will judge to what extent we have succeeded in linking the most ancient and remote Orient with the most recent and most living. Nevertheless, there has come into our hands of late something relevant to present day history which may serve happily enough as a lively and cheerful conclusion to the entire work.

When the Persian ambassador appointed to St. Petersburg received the assignments of his emperor, the monarch's illustrious consort didn't miss the opportunity; rather, for her part she despatched considerable gifts to Her Majesty the Empress, Mother of all the Russians, accompanied by a letter the translation of which we are delighted to impart.^[182](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_182){#Chapter_67.xhtml_chfn182}^

[]{#Chapter_67.xhtml_page_501}[LETTER]{.small}\
*From the Consort of the Emperor of Persia*\
*To Her Majesty the Empress, Mother of all the Russians*

For as long as the elements endure out of which the world is composed may the illustrious wife of the Palace of Grandeur, the treasure-chest of the pearl of the realm, the constellation on the brow of majesty which bears the gleaming sun of the great kingdom, the sphere of the midpoint of the highest rule, the palm tree of the fruit of the utmost power, be ever happy and preserved from all misfortunes.

After having offered these my sincerest good wishes I have the honour to announce that in our fortunate times, through the action of the great compassion of the almighty Being, the gardens of the two supreme powers bring forth fresh rose blooms anew and that everything which has slipped in between the two royal courts has been set aside in the warmest unity and friendship; and henceforth, all those who are connected with one or the other of these courts will not cease to maintain friendly relations and exchanges of letters.

Now, therefore, in this moment when His Excellency Mirza Abul Hasan Khan, ambassador to the great Russian court, is en route to its capital, I have deemed it needful to open the doors of friendship with the key of this sincere letter. And because it is an ancient custom, in accord with the basic principles of friendship and cordiality, that friends offer gifts, I entreat you to be pleased to accept the jewellery of our country, which is offered with our warmest compliments. I do hope that in turn you will revive the garden of my heart -- which loves you greatly -- with some drops of a friendly missive. I ask then to be charged with tasks which I shall discharge to the full as they arise.

May God preserve your days pure, glad and renowned.

We have already shown our fellow countrymen, in the course of our history of Persian literature and poetry, how the ambassador, while tarrying in St Petersburg, expresses himself on the circumstances of both nations both cleverly and modestly.

Recently, moreover, we find this same 'born ambassador', in transit to England, reached in Vienna by the gracious gifts of his emperor, upon which the ruler himself (in his poetical expression) wholly confers splendour and significance. We append these poems too as the ultimate capstone of our cathedral vault, composed out of numerous materials but -- God willing! -- built to last.

Fath 'Ali Shah the Turk is like Jamshid,

Light of the world, Iran's lord, the sun of the earth.

His royal parasol casts wide shadows across the surface of the world.

His waistband breathes out musk to Saturn's brain.

Iran is a chasm of lions, its prince is the sun;

Thus, lion and sun glitter on the banner of Dara.

The silken banner raises to heaven on high

The head of the envoy Abul Hasan Khan.

Out of love was he despatched to London

And he brought health and happiness to the Christian lord.

The image of Fath 'Ali Shah crowned with the sun.

A grand envoy of the lord at the heaven's court

Is Abul Hasan Khan, learned and wise,

Immersed in lordly pearls from head to foot;

He strode the path of service from beginning to end.

Since it was desired to exalt his head to heaven

He was granted to serve the son of heaven.

[]{#Chapter_67.xhtml_page_505}Such glad embassy makes supreme sense

For so noble and renowned an ambassador;

His ribbon is the ribbon of world-conquering Dara,

His word is the word of the lord with its heavenly radiance.
:::

Under the guise of a childish naivety, Oriental courts observe an especially clever and sly manner and procedure, of which the preceding poems are proof.

The latest Russian mission to Persia did find Mirza Abu al-Hasan Khan at the court but not in the best favour; he comported himself with diffidence towards the mission, performed many services for them and earned their gratitude. A few years later the very same man was sent to England with a magnificent cortège; nevertheless, peculiar means were taken to glorify him properly. Upon departure he was not provided with all the perquisites due to him but was allowed to proceed on his way with his credentials and whatever else was required. Scarcely has he arrived in Vienna, however, when glittering confirmations of his worth, striking testimonials to his importance, rush upon him. A banner with the insignia of the kingdom is sent to him, a ribbon of the order adorned with the image of the sun -- indeed, with the image of the emperor himself -- all of which exalts him as a representative of the highest power: majesty is present with him and within him. But it doesn't end there; poems are added which in true Oriental style glorify banner, sun and image in dazzling metaphors and hyperboles.

To make the individual poems easier to understand we add a few remarks here. The Emperor calls himself a Turk, having sprung from the Turkish-speaking Qajar tribe. In fact, all the principal tribes of Persia which furnish the wartime army are divided according to language and origin into tribes speaking the Turkish, Kurdish, Lurian or Arabic languages.

He compares himself with Jamshid since Persians set their mighty princes alongside their ancient kings in respect to certain qualities: Feridun for dignity, Jamshid for splendour, []{#Chapter_67.xhtml_page_506}Alexander for might, Darius for protection. The parasol is the emperor himself, God's shadow on earth, and certainly only he may avail himself of a parasol on hot summer days and yet, he doesn't shade himself alone but the whole world. The fragrance of musk, the finest, most lasting, most penetrating, rises from the emperor's girdle up to Saturn's brain. For them Saturn is the highest of the planets; its sphere encompasses the world below it. Here is the head, the brain of the ensemble; where the brain is, there are the senses, so that Saturn is also receptive to the odour of musk, which rises up from the emperor's waistband. *Dara* is the name of Darius and means 'ruler'. They never let the memory of their forefathers fall away. That Iran is called 'chasm of lions' strikes us as especially significant because that part of Persia where the court is usually in residence is extremely mountainous and so the kingdom can easily be imagined as a gorge populated by warriors, by lions. The silken banner explicitly exalts the ambassador to the highest possible level and an amiable and affectionate relation to England is thereby expressed.

For the second poem we can advance the general observation that the configurations of words in the Persian art of poetry impart a graceful, inner liveliness; they come forth frequently and delight us with their sensuous resonance.

The ribbon stands also for every sort of encirclement which has an entrance and for that very reason requires a door-keeper, as the original expresses it when it says, 'whose entrance-curtain (or door) the sun lifts up (opens)' for the door of many Oriental rooms forms a curtain; the keeper and lifter of the curtain is thus the door-keeper. By Mani is Manes meant, the head of the Manichean sect, who is supposed to have been a skilled painter and to have propagated his strange distorted teachings mainly through paintings. He appears here in the same way as we say Apelles and Raphael. At the words 'lordly pearls' the imagination is strangely stirred. Pearls also stand for drops and so 'a sea of pearls' is conceivable, into which a gracious majesty dips a favourite. When he []{#Chapter_67.xhtml_page_507}pulls him out, the drops still cling to him and he is sumptuously bedecked from head to foot. But now the 'path of service' possesses head and foot, beginning and end, start and stop. The servant is to be praised and rewarded for treading this faithfully. The following lines reveal an intention to elevate the ambassador extravagantly and to secure for him the greatest trust at the court to which he has been sent, just as if the emperor himself were present there. From this we may conclude that the mission to England is of the highest importance.

It has been said of Persian poetic art, and quite rightly, that it stands fixed in an everlasting diastole and systole and the preceding poems confirm this view. It is forever heading out into the unbounded but then immediately heads back into the circumscribed. The ruler is the light of the world and at the same time the lord of his kingdom, the sunshade which shelters him from the sun spreads its shadow out over the whole world, the sweet smell of his waistband is discernible even to Saturn, and so on and on it all strives without and within, from the most fabulous epochs to the passing day of the present court. From this we learn that the tropes, metaphors and hyperboles are never to be taken individually but only in the sense and context of the All.

### [REVIEW]{.small} {.h3}

</div>

If we consider the part which has been accorded to written transmission from the earliest times up to the present, this is very much enlivened by the fact that on those parchments and folios there has always been something to improve and correct. If it were possible for an unknown and error-free copy to be put into our hands, it would very probably be quickly set aside.

It cannot be denied as well that we personally forgive many an error in a book inasmuch as we feel flattered at []{#Chapter_68.xhtml_page_508}having discovered them. May this human characteristic stand our printed book in good stead as well, for to correct various defects and set right many errors remains for us or for others to undertake in the future. Even so, a little note here won't be rudely rebuffed.

First of all mention must be made of the transcription of Oriental names, for which a thorough-going uniformity is scarcely attainable. For given the huge differences between eastern and western languages it is hard to find clear equivalents in our languages for those alphabets. Furthermore, since European languages themselves place differing value and significance on their particular alphabet as a result of their various origins and dialects, any sort of general agreement becomes even harder.

We've been led into these regions principally under French escort. Herbelot's dictionary came as an answer to our prayers.^[186](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_186){#Chapter_68.xhtml_chfn186}^ The French scholar had to appropriate Oriental words and names according to the ways in which natives pronounced and heard them and make them pleasing so that they then gradually passed into German culture. Hence we say 'Hegire' instead of 'Hedschra' because of its pleasant sound as well as its long-standing familiarity.^[187](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_187){#Chapter_68.xhtml_chfn187}^

How much the English have accomplished for their part! Though they aren't unanimous about the pronunciation of their own idiom, still they reserve the right, as is only proper, to pronounce and write those names in their own fashion whereas we waver and fall all too often into uncertainty.

[]{#Chapter_68.xhtml_page_509}The Germans, for whom it is easiest to write as they speak, who are not reluctant to assimilate foreign sounds, quantities and accents, got down to serious work. But just because they were anxious to come ever closer to what is foreign and exotic, here too we find a big difference between older writings and more recent ones, with the result that there is scarcely any compelling reason to submit to some sure authority.

My friend J.G.L. Kosegarten, as perceptive as he is genial (and to whom I am indebted for the translation of the royal poems above) has amiably relieved me of this concern; he has conveyed corrections, included in the Register where a few misprints still occur.^[188](#Notes.xhtml_chfn_188){#Chapter_68.xhtml_chfn188}^ May this trustworthy man be disposed to favour my preparation of a future *Divan* in the same manner.

Everywhere, where one wants to treat me well, it's with a bottle of Eilfer; on the Rhine, the Main, and the Neckar, smiling Eilfer is served. But you hear even benevolent names repeated like Eilfer; for example, Frederick the Great as predominant Eilfer, and Kant^[18](#Notes.xhtml_appfn_18){#Appendix.xhtml_appfn18}^ is named again and again as exhilarating Eilfer. In silence I name many a name as Eilfer. They speak too of my songs with jubilant praise as of Eilfer. Everyone drinks of my wine, clinking glasses in purest Eilfer. This would make me even happier, even more than the Eilfer, if only Hafiz could drink some too. Worthy man, drink the Eilfer! I hurry down to Hades where the sober souls drink no Eilfer, I speak of the Eilfer! Hurry, Hafiz, go! Up above there stands a glass full of Eilfer, that a most generous friend^[19](#Notes.xhtml_appfn_19){#Appendix.xhtml_appfn19}^ had set aside so that I might lavishly enjoy the consummate Eilfer. But, Hafiz, hurry! For I stand surety until you slurp Eilfer on the bright side of the Rheingau, where Eilfer is in its full glory, while I'm on the nighttime side: here shivers one accustomed to Eilfer. -- Come back, O Thoughtful Man, made thoughtless by Eilfer, that I may greet you as an ancestor, still breathing out Eilfer! When I come back my lady friend strives with me: 'Has the Eilfer yet again capsized you! Drunk on Eilfer you lay insensitive to my caresses, as though the Eilfer were comparable to my kisses. Stay away from the Eilfer!' But she doesn't know that you, O Hafiz, had sipped up the Eilfer in my place while I lay senseless there out of love for you!

Wherever one wants to treat me well, it's with a bottle of Eilfer. At Rhine and Main, in the Neckar Valley, they serve me smiling Eilfer. And many an outstanding man is invoked less often than Eilfer. Humanity may have done well and yet, it's still no Eilfer. They call princes good almost as they do Eilfer; if their exploits gladden us, we toast them high with Eilfer. And many a name I mutter low while silently downing my Eilfer: she knows it, if no one else does, that Eilfer tastes best to me. They speak of my songs in praise almost as much as of Eilfer, and they pluck off flowers and branches to crown both me and the Eilfer. But all this would be an even greater boon -- I'm happy to share my Eilfer -- if only Hafiz could have his share and guzzle down some Eilfer. That's why I hurry up to paradise where sadly the faithful never drink an Eilfer. However sweet is the wine of heaven, it certainly isn't Eilfer! Hurry up, Hafiz, come running here!

Sweet child, these pearl necklaces, if I can only manage it, I want to give you faithfully, as wicks for the lamp of love.

And now you come, you have a sign hanging at your throat that of all the signs of Abraxas^[40](#Notes.xhtml_appfn_40){#Appendix.xhtml_appfn40}^ and his like, is the most displeasing to me.

You may take this quite modern folly to Shiraz! Should I really sing in its rigidity one stick laid across another?^[41](#Notes.xhtml_appfn_41){#Appendix.xhtml_appfn41}^

He chose Abraham, lord of the stars, as his ancestor; Moses, in the desert distance, who became great through the One.

David too, through many a failing, indeed many a crime, could yet redeem himself: I have well served the *only* God.

Jesus was pure in feeling and contemplated only one God in stillness; whoever made him a god himself offended his holy will.

[]{#Appendix.xhtml_page_565}And so it must be reckoned true what Muhammad accomplished as well. He compelled the whole world solely through the idea of God's oneness.

If even so, you demand reverence for this wretched thing, let it serve as my excuse that you're not alone in sporting it.

And yet, you are alone! Just as Solomon's many wives converted him to gaze on goddesses and pray to those whom these half-wits revered.

The cow-horn of Isis, Anubis's dog-maw they offered up to Jewish pride; do you really want me to make a god of such a lamentable image of wood!

And I don't want to make myself seem better than the situation warrants; Solomon abjured his god and I've denied mine too.

Was ist schwer zu verbergen? Das Feuer!

Was klagst du über Feinde?

Was machst du an der Welt sie ist schon gemacht

Was schmückst du die eine Hand denn nun

All men, great and small

All things announce you

An egg lies there It is no egg

And in the dialect of the Alemanni

And now the greatest hilarity breaks out

And our tent-stakes dislodge the gazelles

And whoever frenchifies or britannises

And why does the captain of cavalry not send

And yet, those whom I scold are right

And you are like the hortensias

As if it depended on names

As long as you're sober

At midnight I was weeping and sobbing

At the rim of the jubilant fountain

Be gentle in dealing with women!

By the light of the moon, in paradise

Curls, you hold me captive

Do not give your heart away

Do you know then whom the devils spy upon

Do you really think word of mouth

Don't ask by which gate

Don't be saddened, you good souls!

Don't set the jug so crassly under my nose, you lout!

Don't trust the wise man when he's drunk

I'd like very much to compress this book

I don't want ever to lose you!

I have a nice little house

I have become all too willingly entangled in locks of hair

I have travelled through many lands

I like the way your hand feels on my head

I sit alone

I will strew talismans in the book

If anyone happens to be cheerful and good

If Fate puts you to the test, it knows well why

If it vexes anyone that God was pleased

If man prizes the earth

My heart demands that I open it to you

My song once made you happy

my sweetheart's shy sidelong glances

No longer on pages of silk

No wonder that Suleika was besotted with Joseph

North and South and West splinter apart

Now, my dear songs, lay yourselves down

O how blessed it was for me!

What does this agitation mean?

What good does it do the parson-crowd

What is hard to hide? Fire!

What makes you great is that you cannot end

What shortens time for me?

What? You disapprove of the fierce storm

When I'm thinking of you

When everyone is speaking

When I took ship on the Euphrates

When I was so very honest

When on the left at the edge of the brook

When Phoebus weds the wall of the rain

You have granted so many petitions

You have taught me not merely as Qabus

## Notes {.fm-head}

</div>

### INTRODUCTION {.h3}

1.  [1](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn1){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_1} I have numbered the poems in the *Divan* for ease of reference, and in this introduction refer to them by title and number. Untitled poems are referred to by number only.
2.  [2](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn2){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_2} See the notes to Poem 102 for details on how Goethe transformed a prose translation from the Arabic into a powerful original poem.
3.  [3](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn3){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_3} See below pp. 350--5.
4.  [4](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn4){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_4} Karl Otto Conrady, *Goethe: Leben und Werk* (Munich and Zürich: Artemis und Winkler, 1994), p. 877.
5.  [5](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn5){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_5} Goethe had, of course, expressed this theme, decades earlier, most famously in 'Mignon', incorporated in his 1795 novel *Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship*: *'Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt,/ Weiß, was ich leide!*' (Only he who knows longing*/* knows what I suffer).
6.  [6](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn6){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_6} For a good discussion of these concepts, see the classic work by R.C. Zaehner, *Hindu and Muslim Mysticism* (London: Bloomsbury, 2016).
7.  [7](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn7){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_7} Horace, *Odes* III:1: 'I hate the common crowd and keep them away' (*Odi profanum vulgus et arceo...*) -- a sentiment that Goethe fully shared.
8.  [8](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn8){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_8} Thus, Matthew 10:39, I Corinthians 15:36, and most famously, John 12:24: 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.'
9.  [9](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn9){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_9} *Faust* I, line 1112.
10. [10](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn10){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_10} Cited by Goethe in 'Notes and Essays'; see below p. 384.
11. [11](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn11){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_11} For example, by Ferruccio Busoni, Robert Schumann and, especially, Hugo Wolf; for details of these, see Richard Stokes, *The Book of Lieder* (London: Faber and Faber, 2005), pp. 602--9.
12. [12](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn12){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_12} In the introduction and notes I give his name (and those of other Muslim figures) in the standard transliteration with full diacritics but in the text I follow Goethe in omitting the diacritics.
13. [13](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn13){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_13} Persian, like Turkish, has no explicit markers of grammatical gender so the beloved may be seen as either male or female; however, it is usually clear from the descriptions that a handsome boy is meant.
14. [14](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn14){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_14} According to legend, these pre-Islamic odes were written in letters of gold and suspended before the Ka῾ba; there are usually seven such odes in the early anthologies but sometimes ten are given.
15. [15](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn15){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_15} His own calligraphy appears on the illuminated cartouche he designed for the first edition of the *Divan*, with his Arabic title: ![image](images/pg24.jpg){.mid} ('The Eastern Divan by a Western Author'). For examples of Goethe's exercises in writing Arabic and other scripts (including Hebrew, Syriac and Sanskrit), see Hendrik Birus, *Johann Wolfgang Goethe, West-östlicher Divan* (second revised edition; Berlin: Deutscher Klassiker Verlag, 2010), vol. 1, pp. 696--711 and vol. 2, pp. 1866--71. \[Hereinafter = Birus\]
16. [16](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn16){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_16} The German scholar Katharina Mommsen has devoted her career to illuminating Goethe's involvement with the Islamic world and its literature; see, among her many other works, *Goethe und die arabische Welt* (Frankfurt: Insel, 1988) and *Goethe und der Islam,* ed. Peter Anton von Arnim (Frankfurt; Insel, 2001).
17. [17](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn17){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_17} As Edward G. Browne, the great historian of Persian literature, aptly notes, 'of the people of Persia', that 'it is common enough to meet with persons who in the course of a single day will alternately present themselves as pious Muslims, heedless libertines, confirmed sceptics and mystical pantheists, or even incarnations of the Deity,' in *A Literary History of Persia* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1964), vol. 3, p. 299.
18. [18](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn18){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_18} The meticulous and sometimes fantastical commentary of Sūdī may be read in the English prose translation by H. Wilberforce Clarke, lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Engineers (Bengal), of the *Divan-i Ḥāfiẓ*, in two volumes (Calcutta: Government of India Central Printing Office, 1891), and available on the internet at [archive.org](http://archive.org); a paperback reprint is also available. For reliable English translations of Ḥāfiẓ, see the verse translations of Dick Davis, *Faces of Love* (London: Penguin, 2012) and the prose versions of Peter Avery, *The Collected Lyrics of Ḥāfiẓ of Shiraz* (Cambridge: Archetype, 2007). For an entertaining discussion of the difficulties of translating Ḥāfiẓ, see Dick Davis, 'On Not Translating Ḥāfiẓ', *The New England Review* 25:1--2 (2004), pp. 310--8. As the second citation above shows, Davis has repented of his decision *not* to translate Ḥāfiẓ.
19. [19](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn19){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_19} These are Poems 108, 110, 135, 138 and 143; two other poems, 114 and 124, are sometimes ascribed to her as well.
20. [20](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn20){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_20} Further to this, see footnote 50 in Book 8.
21. [21](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn21){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_21} Goethe had fun with his rhymes. Among many possible examples, see Poem 121 where he rhymes 'Rabbi' with 'Mutanabbi' -- a linkage that probably would have pleased neither.
22. [22](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn22){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_22} On this practice, and its condemnation, see Hellmut Ritter, *The Ocean of the Soul: Men, the World and God in the Stories of Farīd al-Dīn ῾Aṭṭār*, translated by John O'Kane (Leiden: Brill, 2003), pp. 470--2.
23. [23](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn23){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_23} For a sense of the complexity of Persian prosody, see the definitive work of Finn Thiesen, *A Manual of Classical Persian Prosody* (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1982).
24. [24](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn24){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_24} For an overview of early Arabic poetry, see my essay 'Questions for Stones' in *Facsimiles of Time: Essays on Poetry and Translation* (Erin, Ontario: The Porcupine's Quill, 2001), pp. 211--31.
25. [25](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn25){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_25} Translated by Gabriel Levin in *The Maltese Dreambook* (London: Anvil, 2008), pp. 53--8. For a superb discussion of the early Arabic poetry, see also the same author's essay 'Who Keened over the Bones of Dead Encampments: On the Hanging Odes of Arabia' in *The Dune's Twisted Edge: Journeys in the Levant* (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2013), pp. 67--91.
26. [26](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn26){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_26} In classical Persian verse, a line (*bayt*) is divided into two half-lines, or hemistichs.
27. [27](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn27){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_27} The poem begins 'In the poorest little fiddle the harmony of the whole lies hidden' (*In der ärmsten kleinen Geige liegt die Harmonie des Alls verborgen*) and continues with the rhyme on 'hidden' (*verborgen*) throughout; cf. Hugo von Hofmannsthal, *Ausgewählte Werke in zwei Bänden,* edited by Rudolf Hirsch. Bd. 1: *Gedichte und Dramen* (Frankfurt: S. Fischer Verlag, 1957), p. 7. Von Hofmannsthal also wrote one of the best appreciations of the *Divan* in his 1913 essay 'Goethes "West-Östliches Divan"' included in the aforementioned *Ausgewählte Werke*, Bd. 2: *Erzählungen und Aufsätze*, pp. 563--7.
28. [28](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn28){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_28} Agha Shahid Ali, *Call Me Ishmael Tonight: A Book of Ghazals* (New York: Norton, 2003). The text cited here is from the website [www.poetryfoundation.org](http://www.poetryfoundation.org).
29. [29](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn29){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_29} On the nature of Semitic languages and on their study in Europe, see S.D. Goitein, *Jews and Arabs: their Contacts through the Ages* (New York: Schocken Books, 1964), pp. 19--32, for an illuminating discussion.
30. [30](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn30){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_30} To get a sense of Goethe's originality in his conception of the *Divan*, compare *Les Orientales* of Victor Hugo, published in 1829, ten years after the first edition of the *Divan*. Though Hugo makes full use of a panoply of 'Oriental' motifs, his poems, however beautiful, have the effect of pastiches rather than of any genuine assimilation, and transformation, of his exotic material; nor does he attempt to strike any balance between East and West, as Goethe does.
31. [31](#Introduction.xhtml_chifn31){#Notes.xhtml_chifn_31} Goethe's opinions on orthography and punctuation constitute a some-what vexed subject. In general, he seems to have been studiously indifferent to standard spelling, often (as he himself remarks), spelling a word three different ways in the same text. In the works he dictated this created no particular problems; however, he could be strict and rather arbitrary about orthography when he checked the transcriptions. Punctuation is another matter; he seems to have had a personal aversion to the comma. And in the usage of the day, the semicolon was often understood as a colon, a practice he sometimes observed. His patent inconsistency may account for the marked differences in the editions of 1819 and 1827 with regard to both spelling and punctuation. More than once he cited the dictum of his older contemporary, the poet and novelist Christoph Martin Wieland (1733--1813): 'Religion and punctuation are private matters!'

### THE BOOK OF THE SINGER {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_1} *Splinter apart*: The first two lines of the poem evoke a Europe in turmoil during the Napoleonic wars. Against this Goethe sets his highly idealised vision of a pure and unchanging East to which he will flee in imagination. (Goethe never visited the Middle East.)

2.  [2](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn2){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_2} *Khidr*: The figure of Khidr, mentioned in Qur'ān, sūra 18 (though not by name), is a prophet in Islamic tradition. The name 'Khidr' (related to the word for 'green' in Arabic) led to his designation as 'the Green One'. Grass springs up about his feet in barren lands; he is the keeper of the spring of eternal life. He is sometimes depicted as a young man with a white beard, to emphasise both his everlasting youthfulness and his venerability.

3.  [3](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_3} *Purity and righteousness:* These are key concepts in the later Goethe's thought. He sees the East (by which he generally means Persian and Arab culture) as a repository of traditional values; for Goethe, the East remains connected with the earliest ages and is therefore purer than the West.

4.  [4](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_4} *Heaven's teachings*: An allusion to the Islamic belief that the Qur'ān was transmitted directly to Muhammad by the Angel Gabriel and is held to be God's own word, sacrosanct and immutable.

5.  [5](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_5} *A spoken word*: The spoken word enjoyed high prestige in classical Islamic culture, as it had in antiquity. The Qur'ān itself was communicated orally to Muhammad and not committed to written form until a later date; in traditional Muslim belief Muhammad was said to have been illiterate, thus emphasising the miraculous nature of the revelation. Oral communication was considered superior to the written word; an oath or a vow, for example, had to be spoken to be valid. It might seem odd for Goethe to espouse this view since his fame rested on his writings but his emphasis here signals the prominence of song throughout the *Divan.*

6.  [6](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn6){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_6} *The mule-guide*: The poems of Ḥāfiẓ enjoy undiminished popularity in Iran. They are often sung to musical accompaniment. Goethe's evocation of the muledriver is not fanciful. The poems also serve as everyday oracles, the celebrated *fāl-i Ḥāfiẓ,* whereby a verse is chosen at random as a form of fortune-telling, just as the verses of Virgil were used in the medieval West (the *Sortes Virgilianae*).

7.  [7](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn7){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_7} *Hafiz*: The great Persian poet Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfiẓ of Shiraz (1326--89 ce), known as Ḥāfiẓ, is the guiding spirit of the *Divan*.

8.  [8](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn8){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_8} *Houris:* These are the voluptuous consorts traditionally promised to the faithful in paradise. The curl or ringlet of the beloved's hair and its wafted fragrance are standard tropes in classical Persian poetry, often evoked by Ḥāfiẓ.

9.  [9](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn9){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_9} *Talisman*: The word comes from Arabic *ṭilasm* (Persian *ṭilism*), derived from Greek *télesma*, and denotes a charm, usually made of precious stones and engraved with mystical characters to ward off spells.

10. [10](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn10){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_10} *Amulets*: These were written on paper, often containing verses from the Qur'ān, and worn as scapulars around the neck and shoulders.

11. [11](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn11){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_11} *Abraxas*: These charms were known as 'Abraxas-stones'. They were inscribed with mystical symbols, reminiscent of ancient Egyptian symbology, and containing the name Abraxas. The name refers to an entity in the thought of the Christian gnostic Basilides (fl. 130 ce) who taught in Alexandria and interpreted the Gospels in mystical and cryptic fashion. Abraxas represented the highest power in his system which was vigorously denounced by such early Church Fathers as Clement of Alexandria. The mention of Abraxas in the *Divan* indicates theological nonsense.

12. [12](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn12){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_12} *Signet Ring*: The signet ring (*khātim* or *khātam* in Arabic), inscribed with the owner's personal seal, and used as a mark of identification; the seals are often found on the flyleaf of books as a kind of *ex libris*. Goethe's line 'the highest meaning in the strictest space' expresses Goethe's guiding poetic principle.

13. [13](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn13){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_13} *Openmindedness* (*Freisinn*): Liberality in outlook forms a continuing motif in the *Divan*; it is a trait Goethe prized especially in the poems of Ḥāfiẓ who expressed contempt for 'those who hug the shore'.

14. [14](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn14){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_14} The poem echoes certain consistent themes in old Arabic poetry. In the classical ode (*qaṣīda*), the poet often brags about plunging into the desert on a noble mount. He is scornful of those who keep to their homes.

15. [15](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn15){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_15} *He has set the stars for you*: An allusion to Qur'ān 6:97: 'It is He who made the stars, so that they can guide you when land and sea are dark.'

16. [16](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn16){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_16} *Talismans*: Further to 'Tokens of Blessing' (Poem 2), these five stanzas are meant to represent the inscriptions incised on charms.

17. [17](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn17){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_17} *To God belongs*...: These famous lines allude to Qur'ān 2:142: 'East and West belong to God. He guides whomever He will to the right way.'

18. [18](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn18){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_18} *Hundred names*: In traditional Islamic doctrine God possesses ninetynine 'most beautiful names*'* and Allah makes 100*.* They are recited when telling the beads on the Muslim 'rosary' (*misbaḥa*).

19. [19](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn19){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_19} *going astray*: Allusion to the first sūra of the Qur'ān (1:6): 'Guide us to the straight path, the path of those You have blessed, those who incur no anger and who have not gone astray.'

20. [20](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn20){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_20} *breathing*: Goethe took this notion from his reading of another great Persian poet, Sa‛dī (*c*. 1200--90), in von Hammer's translation. At the very beginning of his *Gulistān* (Rose Garden), Sa‛dī writes, 'Every breath that goes in is an extension of life; and when it comes out it is a relief to the individual. Therefore, in every breath there are two benefits, and for each and every benefit thanks are necessary.' (Wheeler M. Thackston trans., *The Gulistan of Sa‛di* (Bethesda: Ibex Publishers, 2017), p. 1.)

21. [21](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn21){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_21} *you thank God*...: In his *Gespräche mit Goethe* (Munich: C.H. Beck, 1984), p. 363, Johann Peter Eckermann notes that he recited these last two lines 'in the stillness of his heart', on 28 August 1830, after hearing the good news of a friend's son's recovery from an accident. It is obvious that Eckermann saw the lines as a form of silent prayer.

22. [22](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn22){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_22} *Four graces*: Goethe took the notion of these four graces from his reading of Jean Chardin's *Voyage en Perse et autres lieux de l'Orient* (1735), in which the French traveller writes, 'The Arabs say that God has favoured them with four graces above all other peoples: a turban, which creates a better appearance than the crowns of kings, a tent that is more beautiful than any house, swords that protect them better than other people's castles and fortresses, and finally, poems which far surpass the writings and books of the people around them.'

23. [23](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn23){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_23} *shawl*: The shawl is embroidered with floral motifs and the flowers convey a 'language' that lovers understand; see Goethe's discussion in his 'Notes and Essays' (p. 422--6). The girl behaves properly despite her eloquent shawl and so is described as '*hold*', a resonant German word for which there is no single English translation. Goethe's younger contemporary Friedrich Hölderlin in one of his late lyrics addresses swans by a lake as '*Ihr holden Schwäne*' and it is hard to know just how to translate this (You gracious swans, You pure and noble swans ...)'. And there are Heine's famous lines: '*Du bist wie eine Blume,/ so hold und schön und rein*' (You are like a flower, so good and beautiful and pure, as Peter Branscombe translates it; and yet, 'good', though correct, doesn't convey the rich associations of the word).

    Goethe sings the flowers on her embroidered shawl as though reading them like musical notes, as explained in Birus, vol. 2, pp. 913--4.

24. [24](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn24){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_24} *lessons*: The poet can offer his listeners not only beautiful flowers but plants that are useful too: his ethical precepts and advice.

25. [25](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn25){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_25} In these quatrains Goethe sets out a sort of programme for the *Divan --* and for poetry in general. The number four had special significance for him (as in 'Four Graces', Poem 5) and so love, drinking, combat, and hatred of the ugly, make up his privileged quartet. In the first and the final stanzas the criterion for 'genuine song' is its ability to give pleasure both to ordinary readers and to connoisseurs, and the four themes are chosen accordingly. The fourth theme is striking: the poet must hate 'many a thing'. This will be taken up again in the *Divan* in Book 5, the *Rendsch Nameh*. The primevally powerful 'stuff' of poems -- their prime matter -- must be compounded of these four elements which make up authentic poetry, just as the right mixture of the natural elements makes up the cosmos.

26. [26](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn26){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_26} The Persian poet Ḥāfiẓ represents for Goethe the supreme master of this elemental art.

27. [27](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn27){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_27} This was the first poem of the *Divan* to be written, on 21 June 1814; it was originally entitled '*Der Urvater*' (The Primal Father). The form and style are reminiscent of a student drinking song, marked by strong alliteration *(Kloß/ Klumpen/ Klang*) and comical rhymes (*bliesen/ niesen, Klumpen/ Humpen*, etc.). It was set to music by Hugo Wolf (1860--1903) in one of his *Lieder*.

28. [28](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn28){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_28} *Noah*: According to Genesis 9:20, it was Noah who first discovered wine: 'And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken.' In the Islamic tradition, both Adam and Noah are regarded as prophets.

29. [29](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn29){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_29} *clink of glasses*: The notion that the clink of glasses may bring us to our Creator's temple is a conceit taken from Ḥāfiẓ who often playfully invokes wine and drinking as avenues to true spiritual awareness.

30. [30](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn30){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_30} Phoebus is Apollo, the god of light. The image is of the sun shining through a wall of rain and forming a rainbow which appears white through the mist. This prompts the poet to an awareness of his own white hair. Hendrik Birus notes that Goethe's observations on the rainbow and its symbolism in 'primitive cultures' in his *Farbenlehre*, his theoretical work on colours and light, underlies this lyric (see Birus, vol. 2, p. 933). The appearance of white hair is a favourite theme for Arabic and Persian poets. Thus, the Arab poet al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 1016) can write: 'Today I found my first white hair./ How could my light be dying when/ my heart is twined by black strands/ to the farthest star?' This poem was also set to music by Hugo Wolf.

31. [31](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn31){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_31} The scene of this poem is a field of poppies viewed through morning mist near Erfurt where armies once clashed (at the Battle of Erfurt, on 14 October 1806, between the Prussians and the victorious French). Goethe added the allusions to the vizier's tent and to Ḥāfiẓ to his first version (originally entitled 'Bright Fields').

32. [32](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn32){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_32} *vizier*: The highest-ranking official at the court of the caliphs.

33. [33](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn33){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_33} *Shiraz*: Once the capital of Persia and the birthplace of Ḥāfiẓ, renowned for its roses (and its wine). Goethe contrasts that imagined Shiraz in all its bright colours with the dreary landscape of his homeland.

34. [34](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn34){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_34} *psaltery*: An ancient stringed instrument somewhat like a zither.

35. [35](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn35){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_35} This short lyric turns on a contrast between something made by hand out of a fixed material, like a statue or figurine, and song itself which is drawn out of the flowing, ever mutable element of water. Goethe's use of the verb 'grip' (*greifen*) with regard to the Euphrates complicates the contrast; it is as though the song were also something to be grasped from the formless water. There is an implicit contrast between the Greek way of creating -- pressing a shape out of clay -- and the 'Eastern' -- catching a song as it flows. But even water takes on a shape when the poet's hand seizes it. The double sense of *Ton* (clay or musical note) is echoed in the final stanza.

    In the second stanza the perfect rhymes of the first and last stanza are interrupted; it is no longer a-b-a-b but a-b-c-b, as though to suggest the fluid nature of song as opposed to the more rigid symmetry of shaped clay.

    As Max Rychner notes (Rychner, p. 417), the final image may have been suggested to Goethe by a passage in Jacob Grimm's preface to his 1815 edition of *Der arme Heinrich* where Grimm, with reference to an Indian saga, writes of 'the great poets of all times' that 'they ... can shape water into a ball with their pure hands but which others must pour into earthen vessels in order to carry.'

36. [36](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn36){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_36} The poem turns on the contrast, and play, between dust and rain. Both are elements (earth and water). The 'dust of the threshold' (*khāk-i āsetān* in Persian) is a favourite conceit of poets such as Ḥāfiẓ. In the second *ghazal* of his *divan* Ḥāfiẓ writes, 'The dust of your threshold is like the *kohl* that adorns our sight.' (Kohl is collyrium, a cosmetic used like mascara to emphasise and brighten the eyes; it figures frequently in Persian and Arabic poetry.)

37. [37](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn37){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_37} *Mahmud*: Perhaps Maḥmūd of Ghazna, known as Maḥmūd the Conqueror (d. 1030), often invoked in Persian poetry, though, as Birus suggests (Birus, vol. 2, p. 962), it may very well refer to Ḥāfiẓ's patron Abū Isḥāq Injū Maḥmūd whom he celebrates in a famous ode. But the reference is perhaps deliberately vague, so that it may apply to other historical figures.

38. [38](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn38){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_38} Rain has a different significance in Arabic poetry: it is seen as a blessing. The Prophet Muhammad is often described as 'a raincloud of blessing'. And the early poets beseeched the clouds to rain down on their beloveds -- not to 'rain on their parades' but to bring life and fruitfulness to them. Thus, the eighth-century Umayyad poet Ṭahmān can write of his beloved Laylā: 'May a rain-swollen cloud that cries *hāb hāb* to the necks of companion clouds spill over Laylā's house in al-Raqashān, a gushing white-streaked cloud of spring ...' (*Hāb hāb* is the cry drovers use to urge their herds on.) Out of the union of dust and rain life in all its greenness springs forth.

39. [39](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn39){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_39} Poem 17 is one of the most beautiful lyrics in the entire *Divan*. The perfection of its form, its measured and hymn-like cadences, make it as sublime as it is mysterious.

    Much commentary has dwelt on its Sufi allusions. For a discusssion, see my Introduction, p. xix.

40. [40](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn40){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_40} Light, here exemplified by the candle-flame, is a pre-eminent image for God in the Islamic tradition. Qur'ān 24:35 ('Light') is the famous verse that has inspired Sufis and Muslim philosophers for centuries: 'God is the light of the heavens and earth. His light is like this: there is a niche, and in it a lamp, the lamp inside a glass, a glass like a glittering star, fuelled from a blessed olive tree from neither east nor west, whose oil almost gives light even when no fire touches it -- light upon light.'

41. [41](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn41){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_41} *Butterfly*: Goethe addresses the butterfly (rather than a moth) because it is a symbol of the soul (Psyche) in Greek mythology.

42. [42](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn42){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_42} Goethe's injunction to 'die and become' is sometimes echoed in later German poetry. In Rilke's 'Archaic Bust of Apollo', for example, the last line, 'You must change your life' (*Du mußt dein Leben ändern*) may be read as a delicate allusion to 'Holy Longing'.

43. [43](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1fn43){#Notes.xhtml_ch1fn_43} Goethe concludes the first book on a lighter note with this playful quatrain. The reed supplies the material for the reed-pen (*qalam*), which calligraphers carved to their own specifications but which were also used by scholars and poets for their writings. There may be a distant allusion here to the famous opening of Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī's *Masnavī* with its 'Song of the Reed', though of course Rūmī invokes the reed as a flute rather than as a writing instrument. It is also, of course, the sugar-cane that 'sweetens worlds', as Goethe learned from translations of Sa‛dī.

1.  [\*](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_1} *The Book of the Singer*: The title of this first book of the *Divan* is a Persian compound employing the Arabic word for 'singer' (*mughannī*) with the Persian word for 'book' (*nāmeh*), a common construction in Persian with its many Arabic loan-words (much as Latin permeates English vocabulary). This reflects Goethe's larger indebtedness to the Persian literary tradition, evident throughout the *Divan*.
2.  [†](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en2){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_2} In these prefatory verses Goethe uses the quatrain, the four-line stanza that will occur throughout the *Divan* and that reflects the influence of the Persian *rubā῾ī*, or 'four-liner', much in vogue among classical Persian poets and familiar to English readers from the *Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám*, translated by Edward Fitzgerald in 1859.
3.  [‡](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en3){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_3} *Barmekiden*: The Barmakids were a powerful family of viziers, patrons of the arts and sciences, under the famous *῾*Abbasid caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd who had them executed, for reasons that remain mysterious, in the year 803.
4.  [\*](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en4){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_4} *Hegire*: The *hijra*, or 'emigration' in Arabic, which occurred in the year 622, when the Prophet Muhammad and his followers emigrated from Mecca, where they had been persecuted, to Medina, where they were given refuge. For Muslims the year 622 represents Year One in the Muslim calendar. Goethe uses the French transliteration of the word *hijra*, as was common throughout Europe at the time*.* In German it would normally be *Hidschra.* The term had a personal significance for Goethe who had described his abrupt departure for Italy, years earlier, as a 'Hegira'.
5.  [†](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en5){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_5} *Dienst*: Literally 'service' but in Goethe's use it has overtones of 'sub-servience' or more broadly, 'deference to foreign ways'.

7.  [\*](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en7){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_7} *Schawl:* Goethe uses the English word which has an exotic history. Originally a Persian word (*shāl*), it was the name for a large shawl, traditionally woven in Kashmir (hence, of what we call cashmere) with bright and intricate patterns. The word, taken up by English and European travellers and merchants, seems to have been lost for a time in Persian but then came back into the language via English.
8.  [\*](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en8){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_8} *ergötzt*: take delight in, enjoy (*ergötzen*). See Grimm, *Wörterbuch*,3:820. (Hereafter, Grimm.)
9.  [\*](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en9){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_9} *Lines* 3--4: In an earlier version Goethe had written: *Auch den Norden wie den Süden/ Hat sein Auge nie gemieden* ('His eye has never neglected the North as well as the South'). The revised lines are among his most celebrated.

11. [\*](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en11){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_11} *Blum'*: *Blume*. The last syllable is elided for the sake of the metre (iambic tetrameter).
12. [\*](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en12){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_12} Poem 7 uses trochaic metre throughout for a somewhat solemn, even gnomic effect. The rhymes are often slant or purely assonantal (*Elementen/ empfinden*; *viere/ Völker*) or absent (*tönen/ Trinker* in the third stanza). This roughens the texture of the poem a bit so that the more 'perfectly' rhyming stanzas, such as the second or fifth, no longer seem simply elegant but take on new power.
13. [†](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en13){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_13} *gefodert: gefordert.*

15. [\*](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en15){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_15} *Die Elohim*: Goethe puts this in the plural, as it is in the original Hebrew (though the name came to denote God alone). This is a playful allusion to Genesis 2:7: 'And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; soul and man became a living being.' In Goethe's version, Adam's response is to sneeze.

21. [†](#Chapter_1.xhtml_ch1en21){#Notes.xhtml_ch1en_21} *genießen*: The word had a loftier sense in Goethe's day; it was not merely to enjoy or take pleasure but to apprehend, experience and appreciate something fully in common with others.

### THE BOOK OF HAFIZ {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_1} 'Ḥāfiẓ' was the pen-name of Khwāja Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad Ḥāfiẓ-i Shīrāzī; as explained above, this is what is known in Arabic and Persian as the *takhalluṣ.* In the *ghazals* of Ḥāfiẓ the poet addresses himself by this name in the penultimate line of the poem. The name denotes someone who has memorised the Qur'ān in its entirety, as the poet's reply in the next stanza explains.
2.  [2](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn2){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_2} It was customary for children to memorise the Qur'ān and then be capable of reciting it. Often this memorisation was accomplished by the age of ten. Ḥāfiẓ was celebrated for his memorisation of the Qur'ān which he himself considered the foundation of all his poetry.
3.  [3](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_3} The 'sacred books' of the Bible are for Goethe what the Qur'ān is for Ḥāfiẓ. The image on the 'shroud of shrouds' refers to what is known as the Shroud of Turin; according to tradition, Veronica, a follower of Jesus, enshrouded his dead body in a linen cerement that preserved his likeness.
4.  [4](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_4} According to some commentators, this line refers to scepticism, on the one hand, and the oppressive obstruction of religious bigotry, on the other.
5.  [5](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_5} The desert was traditionally seen as the abode of predatory demons, including ghouls and evil jinn who lay in ambush for the unwary.
6.  [6](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn6){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_6} Goethe here cites the Qur'ān, sūra 26 ('The Poets'). The relevant verses (26:221--6) read: 'Shall I tell you who the jinn come down to? They come down to every lying sinner who readily lends an ear to them, and most of them are liars: only those who are lost in error follow the poets. Do you not see how they rove aimlessly in every valley; how they never follow their words with actions?'
7.  [7](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn7){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_7} This refers to the fact that the *ghazals* of Ḥāfiẓ contain many questionable sentiments, as addressed in 'Fetwa', the next poem; though his piety was above suspicion, Ḥāfiẓ's bold paradoxes disturbed traditional readers.
8.  [8](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn8){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_8} It is not clear which of the several poets named Mirza in Classical Persian Goethe here refers to but he is meant to represent an explosively controversial figure, one who blows apart conventional pieties.
9.  [9](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn9){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_9} This is Abū Su῾ūd Efendi (1490--1574), appointed the (Ottoman Turkish) Grand Mufti by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1545, and known for his scrupulous and commonsensical judicial rulings. The poem is actually a versified verbatim paraphrase of one of this mufti's rulings on the poetry of Ḥāfiẓ. In the final lines Goethe reproduces the typical ending of such a pronouncement with its obligatory humility (the 'wretched' -- literally, 'poor' -- Abu Su῾ūd).
10. [10](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn10){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_10} The controversial Ottoman poet Misri Efendi, known by his pen-name Niyāzī (1617--94) who wrote in both Arabic and Turkish; Goethe knew of him through von Hammer's translations. A mufti was asked to render his opinion on the orthodoxy of Misri's poems. His first reaction was to state that 'the meaning and the sense of these poems are known only to God and to Misri'. He ordered the book to be burned; he further ruled that anyone who shared Misri's views should be burned as well. Misri himself was, however, to be spared since, as the mufti put it, 'No *fatwā* can be pronounced against those who are caught up in an inspiration.'
11. [11](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn11){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_11} The 'high judge' denotes a *qaḍi*, a judge empowered to pronounce sentences in such cases.
12. [12](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn12){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_12} The Fire: a common Qur'ānic term for Hell (*al-nār*).
13. [13](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn13){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_13} It was believed from the earliest period that a true poet's gift was supernaturally inspired, coming to him or her spontaneously from a *jinn*; hence, the term *majnūn*, 'crazy' but literally, 'possessed by a *jinn*', a description applied to several early Arab poets. Here the poet's inspiration is seen as coming from God Himself -- a notion quite congenial to Goethe. And yet again, as in the preceding poems of this book, an opposition is drawn between the sober guardians of the Law and the poet, inspired beyond the strictures of mere orthodoxy.
14. [14](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn14){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_14} This poem, and especially its opening stanza, is one of the most sublime and beautiful in the entire *Divan*, as certain commentators have noted. The stately simplicity of its cadences, as well as the seemingly inevitable fall of its rhymes, reveal Goethe's mastery even in old age. Though the poem is addressed to Ḥāfiẓ, it apostrophises Song itself, one of the dominant themes of the collection; but it does so in terms that seem applicable to God Himself, as He is often invoked in Persian poetry. But for Goethe it is Song that is seen as primordial, virtually eternal. It is an element that is ever 'older' while remaining simultaneously ever 'newer'. What is 'older' is what Goethe has gained from Ḥāfiẓ; what is 'newer' is what he now brings to his own poems, in tones not heard before in his verse. Here too he boldly proclaims his twinship -- and his rivalry -- with Ḥāfiẓ.
15. [15](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn15){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_15} source, as in a spring of water (*Quelle*).
16. [16](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn16){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_16} The German word *Schlund* can simply mean 'mouth' but here Goethe seems to want to evoke something thirstier and more capacious, hence 'maw'.
17. [17](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn17){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_17} Though the poem does not follow the formal pattern of the *ghazal*, here Goethe comes close to evoking its spirit and tone; even the final apostrophe to Song echoes the invocation of the poet's own name in the traditional *ghazal*.
18. [18](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn18){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_18} 'repetition', an allusion to the repeating rhymes in a *ghazal*.
19. [19](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn19){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_19} An allusion to the burning of Moscow, in 1812, by the Muscovites to thwart the invading army of Napoleon. The metaphor is somewhat elusive: the spark kindles the conflagration of the city which is then whipped by the wind to a blaze while the spark itself disappears into space. So too the spark set alight by Ḥāfiẓ's poems kindles the poet's inspiration but then vanishes. He begins in imitation but boldly breaks free, like the blaze itself; he will not follow Ḥāfiẓ, or any other poet, slavishly but will invent new form. This internal complexity -- twinship with Ḥāfiẓ along with independence from his example -- gives the *Divan* its particular, often tacit, inner tension.
20. [20](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn20){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_20} With 'hollow masks' Goethe distances himself from the classical measures, such as hexameter, which he had often used in the past.
21. [21](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn21){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_21} 'the mystical tongue' is more usually given as 'the tongue of the invisible' (*lisān al-ghayb*) in encomia of the poet because of the presumed mystical depth of his poetry.
22. [22](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn22){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_22} For Goethe, in accord with his view of Ḥāfiẓ as a Persian Voltaire, his reputation as a mystic rests only on the incomprehension of his interpreters, not on his own particular insights.
23. [23](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn23){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_23} The final poem in The Book of Hafiz -- strict quatrains in iambic tetrameter -- exemplifies Goethe's attempt to write in the manner of Ḥāfiẓ. He draws on loosely linked clusters of phrases and standard tropes common in Persian poetry (the cypress, the tousled locks, etc.), the sense of which is not always immediately apparent. Such parataxis figures often in Ḥāfiẓ, e.g., in his first *ghazal*: 'Dark night and dread wave, whirlpool, how terrible ... !'
24. [24](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn24){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_24} 'Longing' (*Sehnsucht*) is a key theme in the *Divan*, as already shown in Poem 17.
25. [25](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn25){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_25} 'cypress' is a standard figure for the beloved in all his or her grace.
26. [26](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn26){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_26} The motif of the locks of the beloved's hair, much favoured by Ḥāfiẓ. will be further developed in The Book of Love (e.g., Poem 33).
27. [27](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn27){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_27} This beautiful line ('*unsichtbar wolkig ziehend*'), at once dense and evocative, demonstrates just how closely Goethe echoes the particular expressive qualities of Persian poetry.
28. [28](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn28){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_28} The cup-bearer (*sāqī* in Arabic and Persian), often evoked in the *ghazal*, is a standard figure, at once a disciple and an object of desire (as well as a youth eager for instruction).
29. [29](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn29){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_29} The cup-bearer lingers in the hope of garnering some wisdom from the (increasingly tipsy) poet and sage.
30. [30](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn30){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_30} 'down' signifies the onset of maturity. Sufis often practised a kind of cult of the 'beardless youth' that entailed a rapt gaze at a handsome young man in which a sublimated sexual longing sought 'the beauty of God' in human form.
31. [31](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn31){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_31} 'hints': Goethe here alludes to the Sufi practice whereby the master taught not only by words but by gestures and hints (*ishārāt* in Arabic); for example, by casting the glance upwards instead of merely saying 'heaven'.
32. [32](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2fn32){#Notes.xhtml_ch2fn_32} Rulers and their viziers often summoned Sufi masters to court in order to benefit from their wisdom and perception; and sometimes, too, for the pleasure of being scolded and rebuked by them.

1.  [\*](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch2en_1} The second book of the *Divan* is devoted to Ḥāfiẓ, the Persian poet who is the tutelary spirit of the whole book. Here Goethe draws on many images and motifs found in the poems of Ḥāfiẓ and addresses dense and allusive tributes to him. But at the same time he is careful to assert his own European identity and the essential importance of poetic originality, not merely imitating a distant model. Goethe's 'twinship' with Ḥāfiẓ is an intricate and subtle matter, involving a keen sense of his own 'doubleness'.

5.  [†](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2en5){#Notes.xhtml_ch2en_5} *Theriak*: The word, derived from Greek, denotes an antidote, or theriac. The skill of the ancient physician lay in knowing how to distinguish between a poison and its antidote, both potentially harmful.
6.  [\*](#Chapter_2.xhtml_ch2en6){#Notes.xhtml_ch2en_6} The second poem with this title is also based on the *fatwā* of a Turkish mufti; this time the verdict is stricter even if the poet is ultimately excused.

### THE BOOK OF LOVE {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_1} *Wortbild*: The compound noun announces the theme. The mere enunciation of the lover's name forms an image in the mind. The very syllables of the name shed radiance. The mention of each pair of lovers -- each of whom is often invoked by Ḥāfiẓ -- is preceded by a phrase that encapsulates the story of their love.
2.  [2](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn2){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_2} *Rustam* is the fabled 'elephant-bodied' warrior of pre-Islamic Persia, whose exploits are recounted in the *Book of Kings* (*Shāh-nāmeh*) by the eleventh-century Persian epic poet Firdowsī (on whom Goethe comments in the 'Notes and Essays', pp. 377--9). In fact, Goethe has here conflated Rustam with his father Zāl who fell in love with Rūdāba, as she with him, merely upon hearing each other's names mentioned.
3.  [3](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_3} *Yūsuf* (the Biblical Joseph) is the subject of sūra 12 of the Qur'ān where the attempt by Potiphar's wife to seduce him is vividly described. The wife is not named in the Qur'ān but in later poetic accounts, she became known as Zulaykhā, admired for her chastity and love of God. For Sufis, Yūsuf is a paragon of manly beauty; he is 'the moon of Canaan' and indeed, the human embodiment of the beauty of God. The story was immortalised by the work of the fifteenth-century Persian poet Jāmī (on whom see 'Notes and Essays', pp. 385--6).
4.  [4](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_4} *Farhad and Shīrīn* Farhad was the legendary unrequited lover of Shīrīn from ancient pre-Islamic Persia. The great Persian poet Nizāmī in 1180 wrote his epic *Khusraw wa-Shīrīn* in which the love triangle is most famously celebrated.
5.  [5](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_5} *Majnūn* was a seventh-century Arab poet known popularly as 'Majnūn Laylā', or 'the man driven mad for Laylā.' Like Jamīl, he was one of the so-called ῾Udhrī poets, who wrote of chaste, unrequited passion. Goethe mentions this couple again in Poem 42 below ('Most Secret'). Heinrich Heine celebrated this group in his 1851 poem '*Der Asra*' as '*jene Asra/ welche sterben, wenn sie lieben*' (those Asra who die when they love).
6.  [6](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn6){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_6} *Jamīl*, another early Arab poet, fell in love with Buthaynah after a glimpse of her but was prevented by her tribe from pursuing his passion.
7.  [7](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn7){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_7} The Biblical King Solomon who fell madly in love with the Queen of Sheba. Goethe calls her 'the dark one' (*die Braune*), probably with reference to The Song of Solomon (1:5): 'I am black but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem.' (In the Luther Bible of 1545 the verse reads: '*ich bin schwartz aber gar lieblich, ihr Töchter Jerusalems*.')
8.  [8](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn8){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_8} The name Wāmiq simply means 'ardent lover' in Arabic while ῾*Adhrā*' means 'virgin'. The original story, derived from an early Greek novel about Metiochos and Parthenope by an unknown author, formed the basis of the eleventh-century Persian poet ῾Unsurī's 'The Lover and the Virgin'. The original Old Persian text of the tale survives only in fragments. For Goethe what matters is that the lovers' names are a '*Wortbild* ' (word picture) and still radiate with a magical intensity.
9.  [9](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn9){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_9} That is, a book of readings (*Lesebuch*).
10. [10](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn10){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_10} Niẓāmī (d. 1180), Persian poet and author of epical romances, is discussed by Goethe in 'Notes and Essays', pp. 380--1.
11. [11](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn11){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_11} Poem 31, written spontaneously while the first edition of the *Divan* was in the press, in 1819, was reportedly inspired by Goethe's recollection of Marianne von Willemer, his lover and collaborator -- and his inspiration for much of the *Divan*.
12. [12](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn12){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_12} The poem adopts the motif endlessly elaborated by Persian poets, that of the bewitching and beguiling locks of hair (*Locken)* that the beloved uses to ensnare the poet; but Goethe introduces a European hair-style as well, that of the braid (*Zopf*).The two styles are woven together by rhyme (internal as well as end-rhyme: *flechten*/ *fechten* in stanza 2) and by contrast: the locks or ringlets are the 'heavy chains', an obvious snare, but the lover all too easily runs into the less obvious 'light snares' (*leichte Schlingen*) of the braids, rather humorously seen as helmets donned for battle. This motif occurs also in Western poetry; see, for example (among others), Milton's 'Lycidas', where he writes: 'Were it not better done, as others use,/ To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,/ Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?'
13. [13](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn13){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_13} Another poem that plays on the ringlet-motif. Here Goethe approaches the *ghazal* form more boldly, with his repeated rhymes (a-b-b-a, a-a) only to continue in alternating couplets, all in iambic measure. He also draws more on figurative epithets ('the five-toothed comb' for the hand). The sense of touch is paramount; the ear plays a part but it too is something to be fondled amid the hair. His coinage *liebeviel* has the effect of a familiar adjective (e.g., *liebevoll*) but is far more suggestive.
14. [14](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn14){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_14} Three quatrains in trochaic tetrameter, written -- not for Marianne -- but for a 15-year-old Dutch girl, the baroness Betty Strick van Linschoten, in 1815; it is she who can 'exert such force' on the infatuated elderly poet and for whom his praise of silence and discretion is intended ('Often it is better to keep still').
15. [15](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn15){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_15} Goethe was much taken with the supposed healing properties of the emerald, especially when applied to the eyes. In his novel *Die Wahlverwandtschaften* (Elective Affinities) he writes of its soothing and restorative effects. Various occult powers were attributed to the emerald in medieval Muslim sources; for example, it could destroy the eyes of a serpent if brandished in front of it. See the eleventh-century poet and philosopher Nāsir-i Khusraw's final work, the *Jāmi῾ al-Ḥikmatayn*, translated as *Between Reason and Revelation* (London: I.B. Tauris, 2012) by the present writer, p. 163; see also Manfred Ullmann, *Die Natur- und Geheimwissenschaften im Islam* (Leiden: Brill, 1972), p. 399.
16. [16](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn16){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_16} confines: literally, bonds (*Bande*); the motif of being bound, tied up, shackled, occurs frequently in the *Divan* (as also in the poems of Ḥāfiẓ).
17. [17](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn17){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_17} The poem, unrhymed and in variable measures, takes its inspiration from the Book of Job 4:13ff: 'In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up...' The title refers to the false comfort Job receives from his censorious and unfeeling friends.
18. [18](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn18){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_18} Another poem written in 1815. In his draft Goethe had originally inserted the name Hatem but replaced it with 'the poet'. Hatem was the pen-name he had devised for himself in imitation of Ḥāfiẓ. He will use it later, especially in The Book of Suleika (see Poem 106). In its dialogue form the poem echoes a convention of early Arabic poetry in which a spying busybody chides the love-obsessed poet.
19. [19](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn19){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_19} Written in short, unrhymed 'free verse' lines with variable measures, reminiscent of Goethe's earlier, very spontaneous poems. The poem also alludes to his abiding interest in matters geological.
20. [20](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn20){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_20} *Hudhud* is the word for the hoopoe (*Upupa epops*) in Arabic, a clever and mischievous bird that plays a big role in Persian poetry; thus, in *The Parliament of the Birds* (*Manṭiq al-Ṭayr*) of the Persian mystical poet Farīd al-Dīn ῾Aṭṭār, the hoopoe is both the protagonist and the spokesman for the other birds.
21. [21](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn21){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_21} Another brief, irregularly rhymed dialogue concluding with a strict quatrain. The image of the candles occurs often in the Persian poets; so too does the conceit that sorrow nests in the lovelorn heart, e.g., Ḥāfiẓ, 'Sorrow has nested in the narrow heart.' Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (ed.), *Fundgruben des Orients, bearbeitet durch eine Gesellschaft von Liebhabern*. 6 vols. (Vienna: A. Schmid, 1809--18), vol. 2, p. 31. Hereafter, von Hammer.
22. [22](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn22){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_22} Goethe takes the image from Ḥāfiẓ who wrote, 'Who can order the birds to be still in the field? When I thirst for your sign, where then is patience?' (von Hammer, vol. 2, p. 87). Goethe had initially entitled this poem *'Ungeduld*' (Impatience).
23. [23](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn23){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_23} The shearer in this conceit is the embodiment of destiny but the poet cannot be gentled for the shears: the need to sing out his love is irresistible, a force of nature.
24. [24](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn24){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_24} Three quatrains, again in trochaic tetrameter, with alternating rhyme. Goethe took the conceit straight from Ḥāfiẓ: 'All the unwitting are amazed at my beloved's glances...' (von Hammer, vol. 1, p. 368).
25. [25](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn25){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_25} The 'most secret' of the title has nothing to do with matters mystical. In 1810 Goethe had fallen under the spell of the lovely Austrian empress Maria Ludovica, then a mere twenty-three years old, and his affection was reciprocated, especially after she and Goethe performed together in a comedy which he had written for her court. Goethe was sworn to silence about their relationship, hence the oblique references in the poem ('the imperial throne'). The Empress died in 1816, three years before the *Divan* was published, and Goethe was grief-stricken.
26. [26](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn26){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_26} 'brothers-in-law' (*Schwäger*), here in the sense of rivals. For this sense, see Birus, vol. 2, p. 1055.
27. [27](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn27){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_27} It is not clear which Sufi saint this Shihāb al-Dīn was. It may have been the great thirteenth-century Sufi master Shihāb al-Dīn Abū Ḥafz ‛Umar ibn ‛Abd Allāh al-Suhrawardī; see Birus, vol. 2, pp. 1056--57. Goethe took from von Hammer an anecdote about how the saint stripped off his cloak while on pilgrimage at the station of Arafat as a gesture of humility and thankfulness to God. Goethe seems to have coined the verb *entmanteln* by analogy with French *démanteler* or English *dismantle.*
28. [28](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn28){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_28} Arafat: This is the plain of ‛Arafāt, some 21 km. east of Mecca, where pilgrims congregate during the *hajj*, the obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina; the stop at ‛Arafāt -- 'the Day of ‛Arafat' -- is considered by many the high point of the pilgrimage.
29. [29](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3fn29){#Notes.xhtml_ch3fn_29} For Majnūn and Laylā, see Poem 28 above with its note.

1.  [\*](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch3en_1} The third book of the *Divan* is devoted to love, the first of the four essential poetic themes listed in 'Elements' in Book 1. This is passionate, erotic love, denoted by the Arabic word ‛*ishq* (![image](images/pg109.jpg){.mid}), a word taken over in Persian, Turkish, Urdu and other languages of Islam. The word has strong sexual connotations. When used by Sufis in their love poems and prayers to God, its usage caused scandal. But it was the word favoured also by the philosophers in the Arabic Aristotelian tradition to indicate love of God who is always, in the words of Avicenna, 'the first Beloved' (*al-ma‛shūq al-awwal*).

10. [\*](#Chapter_3.xhtml_ch3en10){#Notes.xhtml_ch3en_10} Poem 35 was written in 1819, but only included in the 1827 edition of the *Divan*, inspired presumably by Goethe's inspection of the freshly printed first edition (like Poem 31 above).

### THE BOOK OF REFLECTIONS {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_1} For this work, see note † to 'Fünf Dinge', Poem 44.
2.  [2](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn2){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_2} This rather cryptic lyric addresses Goethe's many critics over the years, ranging from Frederick the Great to the poet Klopstock and the dramatist Lessing. As Max Rychner (Rychner, p. 454) summarises the poem, 'they have always made a great stir about my failings and in so doing went beyond the truth while laboriously maintaining its appearance. Had they promoted the good that was in me rather than carping negatively, and strengthened my confidence, they might have shown me the way to what is better. O but I found the best of all without their help, the best that only the elect know. It chose me as a pupil; it teaches me penitence and a turn to what is productive when I go wrong.'
3.  [3](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_3} Another brief lyric addressed to himself in rhyming couplets. The conflict between knowledge and love was perhaps inspired by I Corinthians 8:1: 'Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.' (In the Luther Bible the passage reads: '*Das Wissen bläst auf, aber die Liebe bessert*.')
4.  [4](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_4} The poem was inspired by a chance encounter on the way to Karlsbad with the husband of the deceased Empress Maria Ludovica (see 'Most Secret', Poem 42, above) whom Goethe had loved. Goethe called the poem 'a gentle greeting to spirits in infinity, a final echo of vanished and convivial days' (Rychner, p. 456). There is an echo perhaps of Ḥāfiẓ, 'why I came and where I have been is still obscure' (von Hammer, vol. 2, p. 180), as well as of Proverbs 20:24: 'Man's goings are of the Lord; how can a man then understand his own way?'
5.  [5](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_5} As Rychner notes (p. 456), Goethe, in a letter from 1775, mentioned a 'Christian hymn' that begins '*Man trägt eins nach dem andern hin*' (One after another is borne away...) and the recollection may have inspired this poem. But the moral Goethe draws is far from Christian resignation in the face of mortality!
6.  [6](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn6){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_6} The 'goose-game' is an old board game with numbered squares; each player casts dice and moves his metal goose forward according to the number cast. There are unlucky squares, such as number 58 'where no one wants to stop', designated by a dead goose; whoever lands there is out of the game. The game is still in vogue under various names.
7.  [7](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn7){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_7} Poem 60 was originally written as an inscription in the copy of the *Divan* that Goethe sent to the Orientalist Johann Gottfried Eichhorn (1752--1827), with thanks for his scholarly assistance, in 1819; it was added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*. For Eichhorn, see Goethe's remarks in his 'Notes and Essays', pp. 486--7.
8.  [8](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn8){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_8} Shāh Shuja῾ ruled during Ḥāfiẓ's lifetime. Transoxania -- the land beyond the Oxus River -- is the region in Central Asia where the Janissaries created their loud and clangorous war-music, rich in drums and brass. Goethe wrote the poem as a tribute to Karl August who was then taking part in the Vienna Congress.
9.  [9](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn9){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_9} Another tribute to the Duke Karl August and his Duchess Louisa. Goethe's repetition of the rhyme on 'gefunden' ('found') throughout the poem is meant to suggest the repeating rhymes of a *ghazal*.
10. [10](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn10){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_10} The opening couplet is taken from the eleventh-century Persian epic poet Firdowsī, and Goethe's rejoinder follows. The verses are in dactylic measure, perhaps to suggest Firdowsī's epic style. For Goethe's comments on Firdowsī, see his 'Notes and Essays', pp. 377--9.
11. [11](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn11){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_11} Goethe was much taken by the great Persian mystical poet, Rūmī; see his 'Notes and Essays', pp. 381--3.
12. [12](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4fn12){#Notes.xhtml_ch4fn_12} Suleika, as noted earlier, was the name given to Potiphar's wife who tried to seduce Joseph and in later Islamic tradition, came to be a model of chastity and virtue. For the original story, see Qur'ān, sūra 12.

<!-- -->

1.  [\*](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_1} The fourth book of the *Divan* is devoted to reflection, or *tafkīr* (![image](images/pg135.jpg){.mid}), with an emphasis on ethical advice. In Goethe's words, the book is 'devoted to practical morality and life-wisdom in accord with Oriental custom and practice'. Most of the brief edifying lyrics are untitled. Often they represent Goethe's very personal dialogues with himself.
2.  [\*](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en2){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_2} *Schiefohr*: 'one who hears badly or incorrectly' (Grimm).
3.  [†](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en3){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_3} Goethe derived this advice from the *Pand-nāmeh* (The Book of Advice), a work by the Persian poet and mystic Farīd al-Dīn ‛Aṭṭār (*c*. 1129--1230) in the French translation of Silvestre de Sacy (see 'Notes and Essays', p. 510). Hellmut Ritter, the great authority on ‛Aṭṭār, describes this as 'a moral booklet which has long been popular in the East as a schoolbook' (Hellmut Ritter, *The Ocean of the Soul* (Leiden: Brill, 2003), p. 1.)
4.  [\*](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en4){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_4} Poem 49, another untitled poem, this time in iambic pentameter, was added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*, as were Poems 50--55.
5.  [†](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en5){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_5} This untitled poem with its strict a-b rhymes is another of Goethe's approximations of the *ghazal*, despite obvious formal differences; its alternating long and short trochaic lines echo the musicality of the *ghazal*. Not an imitation but an attempt to capture something essential about the *ghazal* in a German -- or perhaps, better, a 'European' -- form.
6.  [\*](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en6){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_6} *Gottes Stadt*, here to be understood as: *die Welt* (the world).
7.  [\*](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en7){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_7} An echo of Proverbs 20:24 in the Luther Bible (1545): '*Jedermanns* *Gänge kommen vom Herrn. Welcher Mensch versteht seinen Weg?*'
8.  [\*](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en8){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_8} Poem 57 was added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.
9.  [\*](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en9){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_9} Poem 59 was added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.
10. [†](#Chapter_4.xhtml_ch4en10){#Notes.xhtml_ch4en_10} *Tand:* a trivial object of little value such as a child's toy or game; cf. Birus, vol. 2, p. 1643.

### THE BOOK OF ILL-HUMOUR {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_1} 'illusory seas', i.e., a mirage.
2.  [2](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn2){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_2} *antechambers*: that is, this attitude is widespread not only among poets and musicians but in the corridors of power.
3.  [3](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_3} Goethe had an abiding respect for the reformer and poet Ulrich von Hütten (1488--1523) as a liberator of human thought.
4.  [4](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_4} The brown habits are those of Christian monks, the blue those of the more pious members of Ḥāfiẓ's circle.
5.  [5](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_5} As Birus notes (vol. 2, p. 1110) this is Goethe's way of countering the view of the theorists of the French Revolution that human perfectibility is possible through social egalitarianism. For Goethe, a human being is born good and it is preferable to 'remain better' (*besser bleiben*) rather than to strive to become better by being like everyone else.
6.  [6](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn6){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_6} This, and the following stanzas, represent Goethe's attack on three of the newspapers of the day; he conveys his scorn by the triple internal rhymes as well (*Knitterer*, *Zersplitterer*, *Verwitterer*).
7.  [7](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn7){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_7} Certain Romantic writers preferred to call themselves *Teutsch* rather than *Deutsch* because it sounded more ancient, more primeval.
8.  [8](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn8){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_8} Majnūn, better known as Majnūn Laylā, was the early Arab poet driven mad by his love for Laylā. See above, The Book of Love, Poem 28, note 5.
9.  [9](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn9){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_9} Goethe is addressing his compatriots whom he often accused of *Besserwisserei* -- of being know-it-alls.
10. [10](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn10){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_10} Goethe here attacks religious belief based on oral tradition, 'from mouth to ear'. Reason alone can winnow the truth from transmitted knowledge.
11. [11](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn11){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_11} That is, a chimera.
12. [12](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn12){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_12} However people dress up their egotism in fashionable foreign manners -- whether French, English, Italian or German -- they remain imprisoned in blind self-esteem.
13. [13](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn13){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_13} They recognise no worth in peoples or individuals unless the recognition reflects what they think themselves to be.
14. [14](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn14){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_14} By 'three thousand years' Goethe means the entire span of human history, as it was known in his time.
15. [15](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn15){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_15} A sūra (an Arabic word literally meaning a 'fence') is a chapter of the Qur'ān. It is customary to cite the name of the sūra and the number of the verse.
16. [16](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn16){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_16} A dervish, from the Persian *darvīsh* (meaning 'poor') was a member of a Sufi confraternity. Here, however, Goethe uses the term 'new dervishes' to mean certain Christian theologians of his day.
17. [17](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn17){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_17} This title was added in the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.
18. [18](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn18){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_18} At the beginning of his mission Muhammad encountered fierce opposition from his Meccan compatriots, especially from the members of his own tribe, the Quraysh. Goethe here draws on sūra 22 of the Qur'ān.
19. [19](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn19){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_19} Timur Lenk (1336--1405) was the Mongol world-conqueror, founder of the Timurid Dynasty, better known to English-language readers as Tamerlane or Tamburlaine (cf. Christopher Marlowe, *Tamburlaine the Great,* 1587). Here, most commentators agree, he serves as a stand-in for Napoleon whom Goethe defended against his detractors until 1814. As in the preceding poem, Goethe uses both Muhammad and Timur as mouth-pieces in his own self-defence.
20. [20](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5fn20){#Notes.xhtml_ch5fn_20} 'parsons' (*Pfaffen*); a term of contempt with Goethe. See *Faust* I, 366--7, where Faust declares: *'Zwar bin ich gescheiter als alle die Laffen,/ Doktoren, Magister, Schreiber und Pfaffen*' (True, I'm smarter than all of the fops/ doctors, magisters, writers and parsons).

<!-- -->

1.  [\*](#Chapter_5.xhtml_ch5en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch5en_1} The fifth book of the *Divan* deals with displeasing things, as listed in The Book of the Singer, Poem 7 ('Elements'). The Persian word *ranj* ![image](images/pg163.jpg){.mid} denotes 'pain, discomfort, affliction, displeasure'. Goethe uses it to encompass all that is ugly, disagreeable, toilsome in life for these too are essential elements of poetry.

### THE BOOK OF WISDOM {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_1} The sayings are intended to have the effect of talismans that heal and protect. See 'Tokens of Blessing' in Poem 2 above.
2.  [2](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn2){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_2} Taken from an inscription on a caravanserai in Isfahan, as recorded by Chardin.
3.  [3](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_3} Based on a dictum in the *Sayings of the Fathers*, a Tatar collection of proverbs ascribed to the legendary Oguz Khan which Goethe knew through Diez's *Denkwürdigkeiten* (vol. 1, p. 192) where it is given as 'Whoever has never experienced good days considers even the bad days good.'
4.  [4](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_4} Proverb taken from the same source as the preceding poem; see note 3 above.
5.  [5](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_5} The allusion is to John 9:4: 'The night cometh, when no man can work.'
6.  [6](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn6){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_6} Here Good Fortune (*das Glück*) is personified as a young girl.
7.  [7](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn7){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_7} For the great Persian poet Awhad al-Dīn Anvārī (1126--89), see Goethe's comments in his 'Notes and Essays', pp. 379--80.
8.  [8](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn8){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_8} Derived from a saying in Sa‛dī 's *Rose Garden* (*Gulistān*).
9.  [9](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn9){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_9} 'blunt': the adjective *grob* has a wide range of meanings: 'rough, coarse, crass, tough,' etc., but the sense here does not seem to be quite so derogatory, and I translate it with reference to the *Goethe-Wörterbuch* where 'robust' is also given.
10. [10](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn10){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_10} The couplet is taken from a mention in Chardin which Goethe annotated. Even the smallest birds puff themselves up and cheep. See Grimm, *Märchen*, 'Der Zaunkönig' (The Willow-Wren and the Bear).
11. [11](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn11){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_11} Again taken from Goethe's reading of Chardin who noted that 'to speak of a man reduced to beggary they \[the Persians\] say, "He eats his hunger"(*Pour dire un homme réduit à la mendicité, ils disent: il mange sa faim*).'
12. [12](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn12){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_12} Again drawn from Chardin who notes, of falcons, that 'they are trained to seize hold of all wild beasts except for the wild boar'.
13. [13](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn13){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_13} On the 'parsons' (*Pfaffen*), see the note to The Book of Ill-Humour, Poem 83.
14. [14](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn14){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_14} 'heat and cold': for this motif see also The Book of Reflections, poem 66. Goethe took the notion from the sixteenth-century Turkish poet Katā'ibī Rūmī, whom he read in translation in Diez's *Denkwürdigkeiten* (vol. 2, p. 239): 'Can anyone who has not suffered heat and cold in this world know the true value of a man?'
15. [15](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn15){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_15} The same line opens the second verse of Poem 88 above.
16. [16](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn16){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_16} Based on a saying supposedly ascribed to the Prophet, as well as on the sources of the two preceding poems.
17. [17](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn17){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_17} Cf. Ecclesiastes 11:1: 'Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days'. As Birus notes (vol. 2, p. 1144), Ḥāfiẓ in his Divan writes (II, 41): 'The proverb says: "Do good and cast it into the floods."'
18. [18](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn18){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_18} The spider figures in the Qur'ān as the being with 'the frailest house' (sūra 29). Sa‛dī uses a similar analogy but with the ant: 'Don't you know how it is for an ant when it's under your foot? The same as you if you were under the foot of an elephant' (*Gulistān*, trans. Thackston, p. 33), a reference Goethe took from Olearius.
19. [19](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn19){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_19} Derived from Sa‛dī's *Rose Garden* (*Gulistān*), 'The table of His unstinting bounty is laid everywhere' (trans. Thackston, p. 1); see also Sa‛dī's *Būstān* (trans. Wickens, p. 4): 'So wide He spreads His table's liberality ...' Goethe found this in Olearius and he also made a note of Chardin's comment, 'At God's table sits both friend and foe.'
20. [20](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn20){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_20} *Autos epha:* Greek for 'he himself has said it,' a formula used by the disciples of Pythagoras, for his pronouncements which they considered infallible. Goethe's ironic advice mocks conventional adherence to churchly tradition; or, as Rychner (p. 485) summarises it: 'Stick with the teachings of authority, like the disciples of Pythagoras, you dear fools.'
21. [21](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn21){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_21} The literal meaning of *Islam* in Arabic is 'submission, surrender'.
22. [22](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn22){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_22} Inspired by a passage in Chardin and by verses from Sa‛dī's *Rose Garden*: 'Everyone who has come here has built a new structure; each departed, turning over his dwelling to another; and that one also had desires and whims, but no one has completed this structure' (trans. Thackston, *The Gulistān*, p. 5).
23. [23](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn23){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_23} Presumably, an allusion to the songs of Ḥāfiẓ.
24. [24](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn24){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_24} Perhaps an allusion to the invasion of Spain in 711 by Muslim forces under General Tariq (from whom the name Gibraltar derives: Jabal Tariq, 'the mountain of Tariq'.). Here, of course, the 'invasion' is poetic: Ḥāfiẓ meets Calderón (thanks to Goethe!).
25. [25](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn25){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_25} Pedro Calderón de la Barca (1600--81), the great poet and dramatist of Spain's 'Golden Age', fascinated Goethe who admired his work extravagantly; he read Calderón in A. W. Schlegel's German translation and on several occasions staged certain of his plays in Weimar.
26. [26](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn26){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_26} Goethe derived the conceit from Sa‛dī: 'The first person to put stripes on clothing and to put a ring on his finger was Jamshīd. He was asked, "Why have you relegated all ornamentation to your left hand and left learning to the right?" He replied, "Truth is all the ornamentation the right hand needs" (*Gulistān*, trans. Thackston, p. 171). Jamshīd was a legendary king of Persia.
27. [27](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn27){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_27} Another poem derived from Sa‛dī's *Gulistān*: 'If Jesus's ass is taken to Mecca, when it comes back it will still be an ass' (trans. Thackston, p. 130).
28. [28](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn28){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_28} *Quark* is literally 'curd cheese' but here perhaps something like 'muck' or 'slush' is meant.
29. [29](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn29){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_29} *Pisé* (*Lehmziegel* in German) is 'rammed earth' or air-dried, rather than baked, clay, i.e. adobe.
30. [30](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn30){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_30} Taken from the *Pand-nāmeh* in de Sacy's French translation: 'Two things are the sources of happiness: a good name and accurate discernment; whoever seeks anything beyond these will come to ruin.'
31. [31](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6fn31){#Notes.xhtml_ch6fn_31} The pearl, a recurrent image in the *Divan* (and a motif much loved by Persian poets) stands for the artistry as well as the hidden essence of a thing in Goethe's poetic lexicon.

<!-- -->

1.  [\*](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch6en_1} The sixth book of the *Divan* is devoted to 'wisdom', mostly in the form of aphoristic verse. The word *hikma* ![image](images/pg189.jpg){.mid} means 'wisdom' but was also widely used as a term for 'philosophy' in both Arabic and Persian. Goethe's German title literally means Book of Sayings (or Aphorisms).
2.  [\*](#Chapter_6.xhtml_ch6en2){#Notes.xhtml_ch6en_2} Poems 85--8 were all added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.

He was renowned not only for his wisdom but for his ugliness -- in this, akin to Aesop (and probably, Socrates). Goethe took the final verses from Sa‛dī: 'The delightfulness and glory of sugar do not lie in the cane in which it grows but are to be ascribed to its own nature.'

### THE BOOK OF TIMUR {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_7.xhtml_ch7fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch7fn_1} Goethe took this poem almost verbatim from William Jones's Latin translation of an Arabic passage by Abū al-‛Abbās Ibn ‛Arabshāh (1389-- 1450), a Mamluk poet who composed a caustic biography of Timur. For Jones's Latin translation, see Katharina Mommsen, *Goethe und die arabische Welt* (Frankfurt: Insel, 1988), pp. 480--1. The Arabic original is not a poem but a rhyming prose account that Jones set out as verse. For the Arabic original, see Ibn ‛Arabshāh, ‛*Ajā'ib al-Maqdūr fī Nawā'ib Tīmūr*, ed. Ahmad Fā'iz al-Himsī (Beirut: Mu‛assasat al-Risālah, 1986); for an English translation, see J.H. Sanders, *Tamerlane or Timur the Great Amir* (London: Luzac, 1936), p. 227. It has been widely assumed that for Goethe the figure of Timur here camouflages the figure of Napoleon in his disastrous Russian campaign (though Goethe remained a steadfast admirer of Napoleon all his life). As Mommsen notes, this poem in particular puzzled Goethe's early readers, some of whom were aware of the Arabic original and were unsure how to evaluate other poems in the *Divan*: Were they translations, free versions, or original compositions? Goethe seems to have intended the puzzlement and taken delight in it.
2.  [2](#Chapter_7.xhtml_ch7fn2){#Notes.xhtml_ch7fn_2} Suleika is the name Goethe gave to Marianne von Willemer, the beloved whom he addresses in The Book of Suleika, and who contributed several poems of her own to the *Divan*. See Katharina Mommsen, *Goethe und die arabische Welt* (Frankfurt: Insel, 1988), pp. 542--4, for further details, and the notes in The Book of Suleika.
3.  [3](#Chapter_7.xhtml_ch7fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch7fn_3} *bulbul* is the Persian word for nightingale, a beloved figure in Persian verse. In Goethe's usage the German word *ahnden* (which nowadays means 'punish') is often used interchangeably with *ahnen* (which means 'divine' or 'foresee' or 'prefigure'). See *Goethe Wörterbuch*.

1.  [\*](#Chapter_7.xhtml_ch7en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch7en_1} The seventh book of the *Divan* contains only two poems and so is the shortest chapter in the collection. The first poem deals with the conqueror Tamerlane, also known as 'Timur Lenk' or 'Timur the Lame', a favourite cautionary figure in Persian history, while the second poem forms a sort of prelude to The Book of Suleika.

### THE BOOK OF SULEIKA {.h3}

1.  [4](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_4} Birus (vol. 2, p. 1185) cites one of Goethe's aphorisms, inspired by the New Testment, to clarify this line: 'The entire effort of our art consists in giving up our existence in order to exist.'
2.  [5](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_5} The beloved has the gift of the past, the present and the future, the gift of remembrance and of hope combined.
3.  [6](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn6){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_6} The name later given to Potiphar's wife in Islamic tradition (see Qur'ān, sūra 12); Goethe gives it to Marianne von Willemer (1784--1860), his beloved, whom he met when she was thirty and married to the Frankfurt banker Johann Jakob von Willemer; she inspired this book of the *Divan*, and collaborated with him in its composition. Goethe incorporated five of her poems in the collection (though without attribution). Marianne herself identified the poems that she contributed, in a letter to Herman Grimm of 5 April 1856, more than twenty years after Goethe's death. See poems 108, 110, 135, 138 and 143.
4.  [7](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn7){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_7} Goethe takes the name from the pre-Islamic Arab poet Ḥātim al-Tā'ī, famed for his extravagant generosity. Goethe transliterates the name Ḥātim as though it were Persian (Hatem).
5.  [8](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn8){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_8} In fact, not 'Ḥātim Zoghrā'ī' but Mu'ayyad al-Dīn Husayn al-Tughrā'ī (1061--*c*. 1121), an alchemist and Persian poet who wrote in Arabic and whom Goethe confuses with the previous poet.
6.  [9](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn9){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_9} The carbuncle is a vivid red gem, usually garnet, cut in a convex form and polished. (Not to be confused with the current medical term 'carbuncle' for a reddened boil on the skin!)
7.  [10](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn10){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_10} This is the first of the five poems Marianne von Willemer contributed to the *Divan*. It was written as a response to the preceding poem by Goethe ('Hatem'). In the third stanza, Marianne had written 'my whole life' which Goethe altered to 'rich life'. Marianne's authorship of the five poems came to light only in 1849, long after Goethe's death, when she told Herman Grimm, then a young student, that five of the *Divan* poems were by her hand; a sixth was later identified ('I don't want ever to lose you...', see below, Poem 124), though it shows signs of Goethe's interventions. According to Max Rychner, 'Marianne's five poems elevate her to being among the first woman poets in the German language.'
8.  [11](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn11){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_11} For this pair of lovers, see The Book of Love, Poem 28 above.
9.  [12](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn12){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_12} The notion is taken from Sa‛dī's *Rose Garden*: 'If Laylā and Majnūn should rise up again, having forgotten about love, they would learn the art of loving from my book.'
10. [13](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn13){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_13} Rose and nightingale are paired immemorially in Persian verse as the mystical symbol of two lovers. But cf. also Rūmī: 'The world cannot grasp the rose's image, imagination cannot encompass the rose' (cited in von Hammer, *Geschichte der schönen Rede-Künste Persiens* (1818), p. 186).
11. [14](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn14){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_14} This is the second poem by Marianne in the *Divan*.
12. [15](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn15){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_15} Once a year the Doge of Venice was rowed out to sea in the golden ship of state known as the Bucintoro where he cast a ring into the waters as a symbolic act of marriage between Venice and the sea.
13. [16](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn16){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_16} The gingko tree has a heart-shaped leaf with two lobes. Goethe took it as an emblem of himself, divided as he was between Ḥāfiẓ, his 'twin,' and Hatem, his assumed identity, and yet, in the end, one poet in his doubleness. He sent the poem to Marianne with two Gingko leaves pasted to the page for the leaf is also a symbol of lovers, two beings in one. He is reported to have said, 'One doesn't know whether it is one that divides itself into two parts, or two that unite themselves in one.' A few days later, Goethe and Marianne stood before a Gingko tree in the castle garden of Heidelberg. This is probably the best-loved, and certainly the best-known, poem in the entire *Divan*.
14. [17](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn17){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_17} Refers to Shāh ‛Abbās (reigned 1586--1628), founder of the Safavid dynasty in Iran. On his birthday, on 28 August 1815, Goethe was presented with a muslin turban topped by a laurel crown, and a basket of fruit, by his admirers; the poem was composed several months earlier, in February (and inspired the birthday gift). The turban made of muslin was a symbol of sovereignty, like a crown.
15. [18](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn18){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_18} 'as He': that is, the Emperor.
16. [19](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn19){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_19} The Caspian Sea.
17. [20](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn20){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_20} Samarkand was Timur's base and residence.
18. [21](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn21){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_21} Literally, 'my devoted I' (*mein gewidmetes Ich*).

21. [24](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn24){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_24} 'a genuine self', literally, 'a worthy I' (*ein wertes Ich*). Goethe will find his true self, not in a narrowly defined personal identity, but in his love for Suleika which confers genuine identity on him.

25. [28](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn28){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_28} Goethe seems to describe here a girl with strabismus.
26. [29](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn29){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_29} Perhaps an allusion to the doubleness Goethe praised in 'Gingko Biloba', Poem 113.
27. [30](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn30){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_30} His praise of Suleika has made her seem a *houri*, one of the beautiful consorts in the Islamic paradise.
28. [31](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn31){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_31} This poem is sometimes ascribed to Marianne though there is no definite proof of her authorship.
29. [32](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn32){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_32} The cup-bearer (*sāqī -- ![image](images/pg265.jpg){.mid} --* in Arabic and Persian) is a stock figure in the *ghazal*s of Ḥāfiẓ.
30. [33](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn33){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_33} For some commentators, this poem marks a turning point and dividing line in The Book of Suleika*,* the largest and richest book of the *Divan*. In the preceding poems the emphasis was on the present; many of the poems to follow deal with separation and the transcendent aspects of love.
31. [34](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn34){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_34} The poem, written in 1815, was inspired by the chestnut trees in the park at Heidelberg.
32. [35](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn35){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_35} For more on Ḥāfiẓ, Nizāmī, Sa‛dī and Jāmī see 'Notes and Essays'*,* pp. 380--9.
33. [36](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn36){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_36} *Väter*, i.e., the 'fathers' or classical masters of poetry, such as Ḥāfiẓ.
34. [37](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn37){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_37} The poem was composed on 7 October 1815, ten days after Goethe parted from Marianne. She has shown him poems that, with all his knowledge of the masters (the 'Fathers'), he does not recognise. He fears a rival but Marianne reveals to him that the poems are hers. The poems, she says, are by me but they belong to you; they come as much from you as from me. (This may explain why Goethe incorporated Marianne's poems in the *Divan* without acknowledging her authorship.)
35. [38](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn38){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_38} Bahrām Gūr (406--38 ad) was the fifteenth Sasanian Shah of Persia.
36. [39](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn39){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_39} Another poem by Marianne which Goethe included in the *Divan*. He revised stanzas four and five. Years later, Marianne told Herman Grimm that she didn't know why Goethe had changed her words, adding, 'I find my own really more beautiful'. She had originally written: '*Und mich soll sein leises Flüstern/ Von dem Freunde lieblich grüßen,/ Eh noch diese Hügel düstern,/ Sitz ich still zu seinen Füßen.// Und du magst nun weiter ziehen,/ Diene Frohen und Betrübten,/ Dort wo hohe Mauern glühen,/ Finde ich den Vielgeliebten*.' (And its faint whisper brings me a thousand greetings from the friend; even before these hills darken, I sit in silence at their feet. And you may follow your path afar, serve the glad and the downcast, there where the high walls glow, I find the dearly beloved.)
37. [40](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn40){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_40} The comparison of the beloved's face to the moon is a favourite trope of Persian poets, and of Ḥāfiẓ in particular.
38. [41](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn41){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_41} Another poem by Marianne, written on 26 September 1815, in the hope of seeing Goethe once again. It forms a pair with her earlier poem to the East Wind (no. 135 above). In Persian poetry the wind often acts as a messenger, conveying tidings to a distant beloved. According to Sigfried Unseld 'these are two wonderful poems, in the spirit both of Goethe's verse and Ḥāfiẓ's (in which Marianne, wonder of wonders, had so quickly and deeply immersed herself). They are poems equal to Goethe's in merit and, in this case, perhaps even exceed Goethe's in their warmth and devotion.' (Siegfried Unseld, 'Goethe, Marianne and the Gingko' in *Hafiz, Goethe and the Gingko: Inspirations for the New Divan 2015--2019,* p. 111.)
39. [42](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn42){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_42} The poem is at once a cosmology and a love poem. The opening verses address the moon as an image of Suleika.
40. [43](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn43){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_43} Possibly an allusion to the Qur'ānic verse, 'God has only to say to a thing "Be!" and it is' (Qur'ān 2:117).
41. [44](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn44){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_44} 'agonising' because before creation, all the elements of the universe lay united in 'God's eternal breast'.
42. [45](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn45){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_45} That is, the agony occasioned by the separation of the light from the darkness.
43. [46](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn46){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_46} The Book of Suleika is itself the mirror wherein the poet sees himself.
44. [47](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn47){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_47} This is the Turkish Order of the Sun and Moon.
45. [48](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn48){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_48} This poem, too, is by Marianne.
46. [49](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn49){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_49} The poem, though by Goethe, is written in Marianne's voice.
47. [50](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn50){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_50} Alexander was said to have a mirror in which he could view all the countries of the world.
48. [51](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8fn51){#Notes.xhtml_ch8fn_51} Goethe took this epithet from the Persian *dil-gushā* (literally, 'heart-pleasing', applied to a garden outside Shiraz), as he noted on reading Edward Scott Waring's *awhid ch Sheeraz (*1808) in German translation.

1.  [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_1} The eighth book of the Divan is in many respects the heart of the collection. It was inspired by Goethe's much younger beloved, Marianne von Willemer, the Suleika of the poems, who also contributed five poems of her own to the book, often in dialogue with the poet. Here Goethe adopts his pen-name Hatem in emulation of Persian poetic practice. The book contains some of Goethe's most celebrated and best-loved poems (such as 'Gingko Biloba').
2.  [†](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en2){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_2} The epigraph is taken literally from Diez's translation from the Turkish (translated into German) of the Ottoman Sultan Selim I who was famed as a poet as well as a conqueror. The poet dreamt of the radiance of the moon but when he met the beloved -- in Goethe's case, Marianne von Willemer -- he experienced the full blaze of the sun.
3.  [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en3){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_3} *keine Kunst*: here it means *natürlich* (quite natural).
4.  [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en4){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_4} The poem, in trochaic tetrameter, uses an alternating monorhyme (on 'seyn') throughout, to create the effect of a *ghazal*.
5.  [†](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en5){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_5} *benamsen*: *nennen*; '*jemanden mit Namen versehen*' (to furnish someone with a name)
6.  [‡](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en6){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_6} *laben*: *erfreuen*, *vergnügen*
7.  [§](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en7){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_7} This was the first poem Goethe addressed to Marianne von Willemer, on 12 September 1815, while he was a guest in the Willemer household, near Frankfurt, for two months.
8.  [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en8){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_8} There are three versions of this poem which vary in minor ways, including in the spelling of its title which is sometimes totally omitted.
9.  [†](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en9){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_9} A variant to this line reads: *Schöne Schrift von deiner Hand* ('Beautiful writing in your hand.') Cf. Rychner, p. 76. In her letter of 1856 to Herman Grimm, Marianne wrote that she may have had this poem too 'on her conscience'. Her authorship of it is disputed, largely on stylistic grounds; however, see the discussion by Birus in vol. 2, pp. 1208--9.
10. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en10){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_10} *reizumhangen*: apparently Goethe's coinage ('charm-laden'). A variant (Rychner, p. 77) reads: '*Wimpern-Pfeilen, Locken-Schlangen, Hals und Busen reizumhangen*\...' (Eyelash-arrows, ringlet-serpents, throat and bosom enhancing with charm).
11. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en11){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_11} Badakhshan, historically part of the Persian province of Khorasan and now straddling both Tajikistan and Afghanistan, was famed for its rubies. See Marco Polo, *The Travels*, trans. by Nigel Cliff (London: Penguin Classics, 2015), p. 48: 'The precious stones known as balas rubies are produced in this province; they are exquisite and priceless and are formed in the rocks of the mountains.' The rubies of Badakhshan are mentioned by both Sa‛dī and Ḥāfiẓ in their verses, as Goethe knew from translations of their works.
12. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en12){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_12} A village in the Ganges Delta that was a rich source of diamonds, as Goethe learned from a vivid first-person account in *Les six voyages...* of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (Utrecht, 1712).
13. [†](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en13){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_13} Note how the repeated alliteration on 'g' suggests the grubbing up and processing of the diamonds, in sharp contrast to the silks and textiles of the preceding verses. This echoes a leading motif throughout the *Divan* in which harsh elements are juxtaposed and set aclash with the pleasing and exquisite.
14. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en14){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_14} A variant of this line reads: '*Balch*, *Bochara*, *Samarkand*'; Balkh (now in Afghanistan), an important city of medieval Khorasan, and the supposed birthplace of the prophet Zarathustra.
15. [†](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en15){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_15} This poem is written in a free 'Pindaric' manner, with short unrhymed lines, reminiscent of Goethe's earliest lyrics
16. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en16){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_16} *Jussuf*, i.e., Yūsuf (the Biblical Joseph), the paragon of masculine beauty in Islamic tradition.
17. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en17){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_17} *bewhelmen*: *überwölben*, *überdecken* (coined by Goethe from English 'whelm').
18. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en18){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_18} *Hatem*: to complete the rhyme with *Morgenröthe*, 'Goethe' must be supplied, the doubleness and twinship of the *Divan* concealed in a single rhyme.
19. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en19){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_19} The first stanza of Poem 126 was added in the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.
20. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en20){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_20} Poem 129 was added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.
21. [†](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en21){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_21} The square brackets here and elsewhere in the text (especially in the Appendix) indicate that a missing letter has been supplied.
22. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en22){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_22} *englisch* here means *engelhaft* (that is, 'angelic' -- not 'English'!).
23. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en23){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_23} Poem 144 was added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.
24. [†](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en24){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_24} *Augenglass*: *Brille*
25. [\*](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en25){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_25} The final poem of The Book of Suleika, one of the most beautiful in the *Divan*, is in six stanzas of alternating iambic and trochaic measures with the recurrent line rhyming on *dich* in imitation of the repeating monorhyme of the classical *ghazal*.
26. [†](#Chapter_8.xhtml_ch8en26){#Notes.xhtml_ch8en_26} *Eppich*: archaic form for *Efeu* ('ivy').

### THE BOOK OF THE CUP-BEARER {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_1} The question as to whether the Qur'ān was created by God or had existed from all eternity (as God's speech) was hotly debated over centuries by Muslim theologians. For rationalist theologians the problem lay in the implication that if the Qur'ān were eternal, it would be co-eternal with God Himself and thus compromise His oneness (His *awhid*), a fundamental article of Muslim faith.
2.  [2](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn2){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_2} Such exaltation of wine is typical of classical Persian verse, and especially that of Ḥāfiẓ who even goes so far as to cry, in his first *ghazal*, 'Stain the prayer-mat with wine!' (*beh may sajjādeh rangīn kun*!)
3.  [3](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_3} Literally, 'it's perhaps no poem (*Gedicht*).'
4.  [4](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_4} Here Goethe anticipates Baudelaire; see his prose-poem 'Enivrez-vous!'.
5.  [5](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_5} 'rot-gut' i.e., *Krätzer*, a rough red, usually Tyrolean, wine. Goethe took this advice from Diez's translation of the *Qābūs-nāma* or The Book of Qabus: 'It so happens that wine-drinking is a sin. Hence, if you do commit this sin, do it at least with the best wine; otherwise, you'll commit the sin, on the one hand, and on the other, you'll drink bad wine. By God! That would be the sorriest of all sorry things!' (Heinrich Friedrich von Diez, *Buch des Kabus oder Lehren des persischen Königs Kjekjawus für seinen Sohn Ghilan Schach* (Berlin, 1811), p. 444.)
6.  [6](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn6){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_6} 'prize vintage': literally, the wine known as Eilfer, especially from the 1811 vintage. Goethe praised it in a poem, using the name 'Eilfer' as a *ghazal*-like recurrent rhyme. See below, in the posthumously collected poems of the *Divan* (Appendix, Poems 21 and 22).
7.  [7](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn7){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_7} This quatrain originally formed the second stanza of the preceding poem.
8.  [8](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn8){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_8} Here again Goethe suggests a *ghazal* form by the alternating rhyme on 'drunkenness' (*Trunkenheit/ Betrunkenheit*).
9.  [9](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn9){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_9} Goethe took the Persian phrase from Chardin: *bī-damāgh būdan*, presumably meaning 'hung over' (literally, to be brain-dead, brainless). German *Katzenjammer* has the same sense.
10. [10](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn10){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_10} *Schwänchen*: sweets and fruits left over after a meal that are offered to a guest to take home. The second swan is the actual bird; the third swan, said to sing before it dies, is the poet.
11. [11](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn11){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_11} 'He' refers to Muhammad. According to K.E. Oelsner, *Mohamed: Darstellung des Einflusses seiner Glaubenslehre auf die Voelker des Mittelalters* (Frankfurt, 1810), p. 26, one of Goethe's sources: '... the Prophet seems to have forbidden wine to the faithful only so as to reserve the right to drunkenness for himself.' Oelsner comments further: 'The craziness lies solely in the violent commotion that took hold of (Muhammad's) mind; his mind is otherwise completely clear.'
12. [12](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn12){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_12} That is, when it is full night.
13. [13](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9fn13){#Notes.xhtml_ch9fn_13} Aurora, the dawn, was wedded to Tithonus, who was granted immortality but not eternal youth; she fell in love with Hesperus, the evening star, who always eludes her when the sun rises. Cf. Tennyson's poem 'Tithonus' for another treatment of this theme.

<!-- -->

1.  [\*](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch9en_1} The ninth book of the *Divan* is devoted to wine-drinking (a favourite motif in the poems of Ḥāfiẓ) and to the figure of the cup-bearer (the *sāqī* in Arabic and Persian), conventionally a handsome young boy who not only pours out the wine but hangs on the words of wisdom the bibulous master poet dispenses.
2.  [\*](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9en2){#Notes.xhtml_ch9en_2} Poems 158 and 159 were added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.
3.  [\*](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9en3){#Notes.xhtml_ch9en_3} *Von Streit der Schulen*: Academic, and especially theological disputes are meant. The poem derives from Ḥāfiẓ (von Hammer, vol. 1, p. 392): 'O, O, what a racket there was this morning in the tavern! ...'
4.  [\*](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9en4){#Notes.xhtml_ch9en_4} *Bulbul*: the nightingale
5.  [\*](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9en5){#Notes.xhtml_ch9en_5} Poem 165 was added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.
6.  [\*](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9en6){#Notes.xhtml_ch9en_6} *gestängelt*: coined by Goethe by analogy with French *perché* ('perched').
7.  [\*](#Chapter_9.xhtml_ch9en7){#Notes.xhtml_ch9en_7} Poem 167 was added to the 1827 edition of the *Divan*.

### THE BOOK OF PARABLES {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_10.xhtml_ch10fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch10fn_1} As so often in the *Divan*, the pearl serves as an analogue of the creative act and particularly, of writing poetry. Goethe took the parable from a variety of sources: from Sa‛dī in Olearius's translation, from Chardin, and from William Jones's Latin translations of Arabic and Persian verse.

3.  [3](#Chapter_10.xhtml_ch10fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch10fn_3} The poem is taken by some commentators as an oblique affirmation of the Resurrection of the Body.
4.  [4](#Chapter_10.xhtml_ch10fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch10fn_4} Taken from Sa‛dī's *Gulistān*, translated by Olearius (p. 54): 'I said to a lovely peacock feather that I found lying between the pages of the Qur'ān, "How does such majesty befall you that you lie so in the Noble Book?"' The enthroned peacock is a symbol of imperial might (as in the famed Peacock Throne of Iran).
5.  [5](#Chapter_10.xhtml_ch10fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch10fn_5} In *Dichtung und Wahrheit* (Poetry and Truth), his autobiography, Goethe writes, 'The Evangelists may contradict themselves as long as the Gospel does not contradict itself.' And in a conversation with Eckermann on 11 March 1832 (i.e., a dozen or so years after the *Divan* was first published) he said: 'Nevertheless I consider all four Gospels to be utterly authentic for in them the reflection of a majesty is at work that issued from the person of Christ and is of so divine a sort as only the divine has ever manifested on earth.'

1.  [\*](#Chapter_10.xhtml_ch10en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch10en_1} Goethe collected moral tales and parables from various sources: Olearius, Chardin, William Jones. This was a time-honoured genre in Arabic and Persian literature, best exemplified perhaps by Sa‛dī, whose works Goethe often drew on. In his announcement of the book in the *Morgenblatt* of 1816, Goethe wrote: 'The Book of Parables contains figurative representations that apply to human situations.' In keeping with Persian tradition, many of the edifying poems are also humorous (see, for example, poem 174).

1.  [\*](#Chapter_11.xhtml_ch11en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch11en_1} Goethe had great admiration for ancient Persian custom and belief, as he describes it 'Notes and Essays' (see pp. 356--60) and in eleventh book of the *Divan* he pays poetic tribute to the pre-Islamic traditions of Iran. (He had a more sceptical attitude towards Islam itself.) The rituals of purity, the reverence for the elements -- and especially fire -- in Zoroastrian practice appealed to him instinctively.
2.  [\*](#Chapter_11.xhtml_ch11en2){#Notes.xhtml_ch11en_2} This majestic tribute to Zoroastrian practice and belief is composed in quatrains all in solemn trochaic measures; it differs from other quatrains in the *Divan* because here Goethe makes occasional use of such devices as enjambement, as in stanza 4, and a rhyme scheme of a-a/b-b, which lend a distinct momentum to the lines, forming a sequence of couplets in quatrain form.
3.  [\*](#Chapter_11.xhtml_ch11en3){#Notes.xhtml_ch11en_3} Here Goethe evokes the Zoroastrian sense of respect for the earth, again in trochaic measures but with alternating rhyme. There are also perhaps echoes of Virgil's *Georgics*; see, for example, Book 2, ll. 405ff: 'Even now the countryman actively pushes on to the coming/ year and its tasks; attacking the naked vine with a curved/ pruning knife, he shears and trims it into shape', *The Eclogues and Georgics of Virgil,* trans. C. Day Lewis (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1940), p. 147.

### THE BOOK OF PARADISE {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn1){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_1} Of course, according to Muslim doctrine, God -- not Muhammad -- is the author of the Qur'ān.
2.  [2](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn2){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_2} The 'young exemplar' in the view of the commentators, is an eternally young *houri*, a figure of continuous rejuvenation.
3.  [3](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn3){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_3} The Battle of Badr, in 624 ce, was the first decisive Muslim victory over hostile Meccan forces. The Muslim warriors who died there were celebrated as heroes and saints.
4.  [4](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn4){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_4} Muhammad here refers to his miraculous Night Journey when God transported him in one night from Mecca to Jerusalem (the so-called *Isrā'*), and then through the heavens (the *mi῾rāj*), on the fabulous winged horse Buraq; the journey is mentioned twice in the Qur'ān (e.g., sūra 17:1).
5.  [5](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn5){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_5} Women too have hope of paradise (with reference to Qur'ān 13:23, among other passages).
6.  [6](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn6){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_6} Suleika, in both the Bible and the Qur'ān, lusted after Joseph; in the later Islamic tradition, she renounced her desire and (despite his entreaties) became a paragon of chastity and renunciation.
7.  [7](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn7){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_7} This is, of course, the Virgin Mary, a figure venerated in Islam (and the subject of sūra 19 of the Qur'ān).
8.  [8](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn8){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_8} The reference is to Khadija, the first wife of Muhammad and one of the first to accept his revelations; Muhammad took other wives only after Khadija's death.
9.  [9](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn9){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_9} Fātima was Muhammad's daughter and the wife of ‛Alī ibn abī Tālib, his cousin, and the mother of Ḥasan and Ḥusayn, the second and third Shi‛ite imams.
10. [10](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn10){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_10} In this and the two following poems, the dialogue between the poet and the *houri* who stands watch at the gate of heaven is set in paradise.
11. [11](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn11){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_11} *Knittelvers*: rhyming couplets with a jaunty rhythm, usually satirical and light-hearted, as here.
12. [12](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn12){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_12} The poet is counting on the *houri'*s fingers the time that they have been together.
13. [13](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn13){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_13} As Max Rychner notes, this alludes to I Corinthians 2:10: 'for the spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.'
14. [14](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn14){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_14} For the Seven Sleepers, see the penultimate poem in The Book of Paradise.
15. [15](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn15){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_15} Abu Hurayra was a close friend and one of the Companions of the Prophet; reportedly he brought his beloved cat everywhere with him. According to tradition, the Prophet himself was fond of cats and once even sliced his cloak on which a cat was sleeping, so as not to disturb the animal.
16. [16](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn16){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_16} Goethe here evokes 'the language of glances' (*Sprache der Blicke*) quite literally; it is not only a 'hidden grammar' but a 'rhetoric of such mute conversation' (*Rhetorik solcher stummen Unterhaltung*), as Birus notes (vol. 2, p. 1407).
17. [17](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn17){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_17} As Birus notes (vol. 2, p. 1410), there is an echo here of Dante's *visio beatifica* in the final canto of *Paradiso* (33) with its 'clarified vision' of 'the love that moves the sun and the other stars' (*L'Amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle*).
18. [18](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn18){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_18} An old Christian legend (the 'Seven Sleepers of Ephesus'), recounted in Syriac sources and taken up in the Qur'ān ('The Cave' (*al-Kahf*), verse 10 ff.) where God says: 'Then We plunged them into a deep sleep in the cave for many long years. Then We awoke them so as to know which of the two parties could best calculate the exact length of their sojourn...'. In the original legend, the youths with their dog were asleep for 200 or 300 years. In 1814, Goethe had used the theme of the sleepers in a play, *Des Epimenides Erwachen*. Goethe's source for this poem was J.C. Rich, *The Story of the Seven Sleeper*s in *Fundgruben des Orients,* III, pp. 347--81 (Vienna, 1809--18); much of the narrative is taken almost verbatim from Rich.
19. [19](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn19){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_19} According to legend, the Roman emperor Trajan Decius (reigned 249--51 ad).
20. [20](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn20){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_20} Satan, the 'lord of the flies'.
21. [21](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12fn21){#Notes.xhtml_ch12fn_21} It is quite characteristic of Goethe, and consistent with the tone of the entire *Divan*, to conclude his paradise on a tender note, giving the trusty dog of the Seven Sleepers the final mention.

<!-- -->

1.  [\*](#Chapter_12.xhtml_ch12en1){#Notes.xhtml_ch12en_1} Goethe described the twelfth, and final, book of the *Divan* in the *Morgenblatt* of 1816 thus: 'The Book of Paradise contains both the exceptional features of the Muhammadan paradise together with the loftiest traits of the devout cast of mind of the believer which pertain to this future serene felicity. Here will be found the legend of the Seven Sleepers, in accord with oriental traditions, along with others which represent the jubilant exchange of earthly happiness for the heavenly. It closes with the poet's farewell to his people, and the *Divan* is thereby concluded.' The Arabic word *khuld* (![image](images/pg349.jpg){.mid}) literally means 'eternity' but is also used to denote paradise, the 'abode of eternity'.

### NOTES AND ESSAYS FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WEST-EASTERN DIVAN {.h3}

1.  [1](#Chapter_13.xhtml_chfn1){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_1} Ecclesiastes 3:1.

2.  [2](#Chapter_13.xhtml_chfn2){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_2} This is probably the *Wiesbadener Register* of 1815 -- not translated here -- for which see Birus, vol. 1, pp. 453--6.

3.  [3](#Chapter_14.xhtml_chfn3){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_3} Johann Gottfried Herder (1744--1803), an early influence on the young Goethe, had extensive knowledge of Oriental poetry. Johann Gottfried Eichhorn (1752--1827), Professor of Oriental Studies in Jena and later in Göttingen, built upon Herder's influence, especially in bringing Goethe to a wider appreciation of Eastern poetry through a closer reading of biblical poetry. For Goethe's further tribute to Eichhorn, see pp. 486--7 below.

4.  [4](#Chapter_15.xhtml_chfn4){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_4} Sir William Jones (1746--94). His translation of the *Moallakat* (i.e., as correctly transliterated, *Mu‛allaqāt*) was first published in 1783 and inspired Goethe's life-long fascination with the poems; he was still working to translate them forty years later; cf. K. Mommsen, 'Goethe und die Moallakat', *Sitzungsberichte der Deutschen Akademie der Wissen- schaften zu Berlin. Klasse für Sprachen, Literatur und Kunst*, Jahrgang 1960, no. 2. Goethe here translates Jones's remarks from his *Poëseos* *Asiaticae Commentariorum Libri Sex* (London: T. Cadell, 1774), pp. 84--5.

5.  [5](#Chapter_15.xhtml_chfn5){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_5} The original poem is attributed to the pre-Islamic 'outlaw' poet Ta'ab- baṭa Sharran. Goethe knew the poem in at least three different translations and he may have drawn on all of them for his version. According to the nineteenth-century poet and translator Friedrich Rückert, Goethe used a Latin translation of 1814 by the Dutch philologist Albert Schultens (1686--1750). Goethe also knew the Latin and German translation of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Freytag (1788--1861), contained in the latter's dissertation (Göttingen, 1814), as well as a prose version by Michaelis in Arpenius's *Arabische Grammatik*. On 23 September 1818, he turned for advice to his friend, the Orientalist Hans Gottfried Ludwig Kosegarten, who helped him with the revision of his version; see K. Mommsen, *Goethe und die arabische Welt* (Frankfurt: Insel, 1988), p. 141ff. for details. For the original Arabic, a literal translation and a commentary, see Alan Jones, *Early Arabic Poetry* (Oxford: Ithaca Press, 1992), vol. 1, pp. 229--47.

6.  [6](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn6){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_6} The Parsis -- or Parsees -- are the surviving remnants of the Zoroastrians, who maintain the ancient rites and doctrines; today they are mostly centred in Mumbai, formerly Bombay.

7.  [7](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn7){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_7} A derogatory term (from Persian *gabr*) used especially by Muslims to designate the Zoroastrians who remained in Islamic lands after the conquest; the word has overtones of 'infidel'.

8.  [8](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn8){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_8} A reference to polo.

9.  [9](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn9){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_9} Smerdis was the brother of the Achaemenid king Cambyses II and usurped his throne; cf. Herodotus, III: 61--80.

10. [10](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn10){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_10} The Magi were a priestly caste of Medes in ancient Persia.

11. [11](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn11){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_11} The Sasanian king Chosroes II (590--628 ad); Goethe alludes to their love in the poem 'Musterbilder', Poem 28.

12. [12](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn12){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_12} By this Goethe refers to the *Parsi Nameh*, the eleventh book of the *Divan,* which contains the poem 'Vermächtnis alt persischen Glaubens' (The Legacy of Old Persian Belief) -- Poem 178 above. In these *Notes*, he refers to himself frequently as 'the poet' (*der Dichter*).

13. [13](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn13){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_13} I.e., a Zoroastrian priest (from Persian *mūbad*).

14. [14](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn14){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_14} The Barmakids were a powerful family of Central Asian origin which supplied a succession of viziers to the early Abbasid Caliphate and exerted great power until they were extirpated by the Caliph Harūn al-Rashīd, for reasons that remain obscure, in 803.

15. [15](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn15){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_15} Despite much speculation it is not clear to what event Goethe refers here.

16. [16](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn16){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_16} Darius I (reigned 522--486 BC) established the Achaemenid empire.

17. [17](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn17){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_17} Darius III (reigned 336--330 BC) was toppled by Alexander the Great.

18. [18](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn18){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_18} i.e., the Greeks.

19. [19](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn19){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_19} This is Shāpūr I, the second Sasanian king, who ruled from 241--72 ad. By 'the poet' Goethe here refers again to himself.

20. [20](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn20){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_20} An error on Goethe's part: the Roman emperor was not Valentinian but Valerian (reigned 253--9 AD) who was besieged by Shapur I in260 ad.

21. [21](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn21){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_21} Goethe here apparently refers to Hinduism.

22. [22](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn22){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_22} The '*Fables* of Bidpai' was translated from Sanskrit into Pahlavi under Chosroes I (reigned 531--79 ad) from the *Panchatantra*, a 'mirror for princes' compiled probably between 300 and 200 bc and attributed to the ancient Hindu sage Vishnu Sharma; in the eighth century it was translated from Pahlavi into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa῾ and became widely known under the title *Kalila and Dimna*. Goethe had read the *Fables* in German and French translations.

23. [23](#Chapter_17.xhtml_chfn23){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_23} i.e., as is found in the Fables of Bidpai.

24. [24](#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn24){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_24} See *Faust* II, verses 5573--5: 'I am extravagance, I am poetry; / I am the poet who fulfils himself/ when he squanders his innermost good' (*Bin die Verschwendung, bin die Poesie;/ Bin der Poet, der sich vollendet,/ Wenn er sein eigenst Gut verschwendet*).

25. [25](#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn25){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_25} See Qur'ān II:2-7. Goethe quotes the Qur'ān in Theodor Arnold's German translation of the 1734 English translation by George Sale; in the verses quoted here I use Sale's original version.

26. [26](#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn26){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_26} Goethe here quotes from the appendix to Jakob Gohl's *Grammatica Arabica* of 1656; this was a revision which Gohl (1596--1667) made of the earlier Arabic grammar by Thomas Erpenius.

27. [27](#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn27){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_27} Abū Ṭayyib al-Mutanabbī (915--65 ad), generally considered the greatest of classical Arabic poets, was linked with the radical Carmathian movement.

28. [28](#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn28){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_28} Goethe seems to refer to the well-established practice of *naskh* (abrogation) in Qur'ānic tradition whereby an earlier verse could be deemed rescinded by a later one.

29. [29](#Chapter_18.xhtml_chfn29){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_29} i.e., alluding to the literal meaning of the Arabic word *islām*, 'submission, surrender'.

30. [30](#Chapter_19.xhtml_chfn30){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_30} This is incorrect. Both Pahlavi and Greek continued to be in official use until well into Umayyad times and the reign of the Caliph 'Abd al-Malik (reg. 685--705) when coins were first minted with Arabic inscriptions.

31. [31](#Chapter_19.xhtml_chfn31){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_31} Goethe was mistaken in considering the Barmakids of Zoroastrian origin, as his allusion to 'the sacred fire' suggests; rather, the family forebears were apparently Buddhists.

32. [32](#Chapter_21.xhtml_chfn32){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_32} 'an oppressive narrowness': *eine dumpfe Beschränktheit*. The phrase encapsulates Goethe's reservations about Islam.

33. [33](#Chapter_21.xhtml_chfn33){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_33} This passage figured, improbably enough, in the recent uproar over the German banker Thilo Sarrazin's controversial book *Deutschland schafft sich ab: wie wir unser Land aufs Spiel setzen* ('Germany abdicates: How we are putting our country at risk') (Munich: Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, 2010), with its presumed criticism of Muslim refusal to integrate fully into German society; cf. Sarrazin's gloating article in the *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung* for 24 December 2010, and the subsequent rebuttal by Necla Kelek (11 January 2011) as well as the particularly vitriolic onslaught on Sarrazin by Thomas Lehr (18 January 2011) in the same newspaper.

34. [34](#Chapter_21.xhtml_chfn34){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_34} In seeing 'vice' as a kind of mental aberration in Hinduism Goethe oversimplifies the Hindu position; perhaps the Hindu emphasis on the illusory nature of reality and of desire led him to this misconception.

35. [35](#Chapter_21.xhtml_chfn35){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_35} The word *dīvān* originally denoted a 'register', as of accounts. It developed into a powerful ministry with a wide mandate with responsibility for taxes, duties, government finances and the like. The word, of Persian origin, came to denote a collection of poems as well and found its way into European languages to indicate border and customs controls, e.g. French *douane*. See introduction for further details.

36. [36](#Chapter_23.xhtml_chfn36){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_36} Z*ersplitterung* ('fragmentation'), a resonant word for Goethe, as the opening line (of Poem 1) of the *Divan* shows: 'North and West and South split apart\...' (*Nord und West und Süd zersplittern...*), as though he had to shatter an old world in order to create a new one in verse.

37. [37](#Chapter_23.xhtml_chfn37){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_37} Yazdegerd III, the last Sasanian ruler, was killed by the Arab armies of conquest in 651 ad. For Ahasuerus, see *Esther* 6:1ff.

38. [38](#Chapter_23.xhtml_chfn38){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_38} The Samanids, a Persian dynasty which flourished in eastern Iran and central Asia from 819 to 1005; it was overthrown by the Ghaznavids under Maḥmūd the Conqueror (reigned 998--1030).

39. [39](#Chapter_24.xhtml_chfn39){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_39} Goethe here confuses Abu Nasr Ahmed Asadī, the teacher of Firdowsī, with his son *῾*Alī Asadī, the lexicographer and poet who composed the *Garshāsp-nāmeh*, an imitation of the *Shāh-nāmeh*, in 1066, some thirty years after Firdowsī's death (cf. Browne, *A Literary History of Persia*, vol. 2, pp. 272ff.).

40. [40](#Chapter_25.xhtml_chfn40){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_40} For Anvārī, see Browne, *Literary History*, vol. 2, pp. 364--91.

41. [41](#Chapter_25.xhtml_chfn41){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_41} Goethe here reacts against the condemnation of panegyric which Joseph von Hammer (on whom he relied for most of his knowledge of Persian poetry) had launched, denouncing it as 'sheer idolatry' and 'lickspittlery' (*Speichelleckerey*); cf. the notes to Goethe, *Werke* (Munich: Hanser, 1998), vol. 11.1.2, p. 772.

42. [42](#Chapter_25.xhtml_chfn42){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_42} I.e. his mastery of the game, wildly popular at court.

47. [47](#Chapter_27.xhtml_chfn47){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_47} i.e., Konya in present-day Turkey.

48. [48](#Chapter_27.xhtml_chfn48){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_48} Not Genghis Khan in fact but the Great Khan Möngke (died 1259), one of his successors; the destruction of Baghdad, and of the Abbasid Caliphate, occurred in 1258 under his brother, the Mongol leader Hülagü, and it is no doubt this event to which Goethe alludes.

49. [49](#Chapter_27.xhtml_chfn49){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_49} Goethe here alludes to the doctrine of *tawḥīd* (the oneness of God), central to Islamic belief, and to its further elaboration, in the mystical teachings of the Sufi Ibn ‛Arabī, as *waḥdat al-wujūd* (oneness of being).

50. [50](#Chapter_30.xhtml_chfn50){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_50} Goethe seems to be alluding here to the various paradoxical and provocative sayings and deeds of the Sufi masters, whose considerable idiosyncrasies and eccentricities are all lovingly documented in the early literature in both Arabic and Persian. Jāmī's huge prose work entitled *Nafahāt al-Uns* (The Breaths of Fellowship) gives biographies of 611 Sufi saints; cf. Browne, *Literary History*, vol. 3, pp. 435--6.

51. [51](#Chapter_31.xhtml_chfn51){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_51} In 'Hegira', the first poem of the *Divan*, Goethe introduces this image:

61. [52](#Chapter_31.xhtml_chfn52){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_52} Goethe refers to the fact that drama was never cultivated in classical Islamic literature and remained largely unknown until modern times.

62. [53](#Chapter_32.xhtml_chfn53){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_53} Goethe engages in a bit of wordplay here, which is hard to convey; the poet, he says, 'rhymes the unrhymed together' ('das Ungereimte zusammenreimt'), i.e., 'strings together nonsense.'

63. [54](#Chapter_32.xhtml_chfn54){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_54} The anecdote is widely cited in Sufi literature; Niẓāmī relates it in his *Makhzan al-Asrār* ('Treasure House of Secrets'); cf. Hellmut Ritter, *The Ocean of the Soul* (Leiden; Boston: E.J. Brill, 2003), p. 252.

64. [55](#Chapter_33.xhtml_chfn55){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_55} No single English word conveys the range of meanings of 'Geist', as indeed Goethe here demonstrates; among its many meanings are those of 'mind' and 'intelligence', as well as 'wit' (comparable to French *esprit*), but it also conveys notions of 'spirit'.

65. [56](#Chapter_33.xhtml_chfn56){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_56} German *genialisch*.

66. [57](#Chapter_33.xhtml_chfn57){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_57} Bahrām Gūr, a Sasanian king (reigned 420--38), and his beloved slave-girl Dilaram were said to have invented rhyme through their amorous conversation which fell into rhyme because of the deep affinity which bound them together. The early eighth-century poet Jamīl was one of the ῾Udhrī poets -- who, as Heine wrote, 'die when they love' -- and Buthayna was the object of his hopeless passion. For Jamīl, see poem 29 in the *Divan*.

67. [58](#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn58){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_58} The ambassador in question was Abū al-Ḥasan Khān Shīrāzī (born in 1776) who visited St. Petersburg at the beginning of 1816. He was apparently the original model for *Hajji Baba in England* by James Morier whom he accompanied on his journey to England; he later wrote his *Hayrat-nāmeh* institutions; cf. Antonino Pagliaro & Alessandro Bausani, *La letteratura persiana* (Milan, 1968), pp. 536--7.

68. [59](#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn59){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_59} What follows is presumably what the merchant said to the robbers.

69. [60](#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn60){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_60} ‛Umar ibn ‛Abd al-‛Azīz (reigned 717--20 ad) was unique among Umayyad caliphs in being revered for his piety.

70. [61](#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn61){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_61} Buhlūl is a legendary 'wise fool', about whom many humorous anecdotes are preserved in folk literature.

71. [62](#Chapter_34.xhtml_chfn62){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_62} Fatḥ ῾Alī Shāh, of the Qajar Dynasty, ruled Iran from 1797 until 1834.

72. [63](#Chapter_35.xhtml_chfn63){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_63} A bit of anti-Romantic malice on Goethe's part: the lines (*Mir will ewiger Durst nur frommen/ Nach dem Durste*) are by his younger contemporary Joseph von Eichendorff and appear in the latter's novel *Ahnung und Gegenwart* of 1815; cf. Joseph von Eichendorff, *Werke in einem Band* (Munich: Hanser, 2007), p. 574.

73. [64](#Chapter_36.xhtml_chfn64){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_64} Anvārī's lines are probably addressed to the panegyric poet Shujā‛ī Nasavī (flourished 12th century).

74. [65](#Chapter_37.xhtml_chfn65){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_65} Goethe translated this passage from the English of Sir John Malcolm (1769--1833), *The History of Persia* (1815), which I here give in Malcolm's original words.

75. [66](#Chapter_37.xhtml_chfn66){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_66} This was Matthäus von Collin (1779--1824), a professor at the universities of Krakow and Vienna, who was also editor of the Viennese *Jahrbücher der Literatur* in the first volume of which this review appeared in 1818.

78. [69](#Chapter_38.xhtml_chfn69){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_69} An Arabic verse (in praise of the Mongol conqueror Hülagü) which the 14th-century poet and court historian ῾Abd Allāh Ibn Faḍl Allāh Vaṣṣāf of Shiraz, known as 'the Panegyrist of the Presence' (*Vaṣṣāf-i Ḥaḍrat*), inserted into his tedious and florid official history in Persian, a work which Browne calls 'as important as it is unreadable' (Browne, vol. 3, p. 68); cf. also *The Encyclopaedia of Islam* (2nd ed.), vol. 11, p. 174, and Pagliaro & Bausani, p. 519. Goethe cites von Hammer's translation of his couplet here; for the original, see *Vaṣṣāf* (Bombay, 1269 ah), vol. 1, p. 51.

81. [72](#Chapter_39.xhtml_chfn72){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_72} German *eine Welt von Putz und Pracht*.

82. [73](#Chapter_39.xhtml_chfn73){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_73} See the verses in the *Divan* (Poem 117 in The Book of Suleika) which begin, 'Nur wenig ist's was ich verlange ...' for Goethe's own exploration of this conceit.

83. [74](#Chapter_40.xhtml_chfn74){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_74} 'Gaiety' conveys only one nuance of the German word *Heiterkeit* which ranges from cheerfulness to serenity, with connotations of gladness, humour, high spirits and hilarity.

84. [75](#Chapter_41.xhtml_chfn75){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_75} Johann Jacob Reiske (1716--74), the first German Arabist, a feisty independent scholar and author whose critical observations made him many enemies; Goethe read certain of his works as a student. Johann David Michaelis (1717--91), professor at the University of Göttingen, who taught Semitic philology, Biblical studies and theology; as a young man, Goethe had wanted to study under him.

85. [76](#Chapter_42.xhtml_chfn76){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_76} For Goethe's take on Marco Polo, see below, pp. 464--5.

86. [77](#Chapter_42.xhtml_chfn77){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_77} The image is taken from Ḥāfiẓ; cf. also, Goethe's *Divan*, Poem 32: 'Auch in Locken hab' ich mich/ Gar zu gern verfangen\...' (I have myself all too willingly become entangled in locks of hair).

87. [78](#Chapter_42.xhtml_chfn78){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_78} It isn't clear whether Goethe refers here to the rhyming couplets of the *masnavī* form, as practised by Rūmī, or to the *aa*, *ba*, *ca*, etc. rhyme-patterns of the *ghazal*.

88. [79](#Chapter_43.xhtml_chfn79){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_79} Goethe here quotes Matthäus von Collin again; cf. note 66 above.

89. [80](#Chapter_44.xhtml_chfn80){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_80} Jean Paul Richter (1763--1825), German author noted for his extravagant and inimitable prose style which Goethe had loathed and attacked in print. Goethe knew Richter when the latter lived in Weimar (1798--1800); as this passage shows, Goethe's opinion of Richter altered for the better in later years.

90. [81](#Chapter_44.xhtml_chfn81){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_81} Words and phrases taken from Richter's '10. Hundsposttag' in the journal *Hesperus* (1795).

91. [82](#Chapter_45.xhtml_chfn82){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_82} German *Schöne Redekünste.*

92. [83](#Chapter_49.xhtml_chfn83){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_83} This refers to Karl Heinrich von Bogatzky's *Güldene Schatzkästlein der Kinder Gottes, deren Schatz im Himmel ist* (Golden Treasure-Chest of the Children of God whose Treasure is in Heaven) of 1718, to which Goethe's mother turned for solace when he was ill.

93. [84](#Chapter_49.xhtml_chfn84){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_84} The Persian word *fāl* means 'omen' or 'augury' but commonly refers to the practice of divination -- still common today -- based on the random selection of verses from the *Dīvān* of Ḥāfiẓ somewhat like the ancient *sortes Virgilianae*.

94. [85](#Chapter_49.xhtml_chfn85){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_85} Goethe here alludes to his own poem in the *Divan* which begins, 'Talismane werd' ich in dem Buch zerstreuen' (Poem 85). He himself is, of course, 'the Western poet'.

95. [86](#Chapter_50.xhtml_chfn86){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_86} Goethe provides a list of flowers and other objects which are to be elucidated through the rhymes which the lovers supply, e.g. *Amarante = ich sah und brannte* (Amaranth: 'I saw and burned'), *Haar vom Tiger* = *ein kühner Krieger* 'Hair of tiger = a bold warrior'), etc. These are the 'exchanges' of his discussion.

96. [87](#Chapter_50.xhtml_chfn87){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_87} An allusion to Franz Anton Mesmer (1734--1815) and his 'organic' (or 'animal') magnetism, which intrigued and influenced Goethe over a long period and played a part in his novel *Die Wahlverwandtschaften* (*Elective Affinities*).

97. [88](#Chapter_51.xhtml_chfn88){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_88} Goethe here gives an example of a cipher-poem which he composed together with Marianne von Willemer, who collaborated with him in writing the *Divan*; the poem entwines together lines from von Hammer's translation of Ḥāfiẓ. For examples by Goethe and Marianne, see Birus, vol. 1, pp. 601, 605--7.

98. [89](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn89){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_89} Goethe was sometimes careless with his own titles. This is a reference to the first book of the *Divan*, *Moganni Nameh* or The Book of the Singer.

99. [90](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn90){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_90} 'The poet' is Goethe himself, and the occasion, a masque on 18 December 1818 in Weimar, in the presence of the Empress Mother Maria Feodorovna.

100. [91](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn91){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_91} This is the second book of the *Divan*.

101. [92](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn92){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_92} Poem 27 in The Book of Hafiz, the second book of the *Divan*.

102. [93](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn93){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_93} 'Longing' (*Sehnsucht*) is a key theme in the *Divan*, as already shown in Book 1, Poem 17.

103. [94](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn94){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_94} 'Cypress' is a standard figure for the beloved in all his or her grace.

104. [95](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn95){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_95} The motif of the locks of the beloved's hair, much favoured by Ḥāfiẓ will be further developed in The Book of Love (e.g., Poem 33).

105. [96](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn96){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_96} This beautiful line (*Unsichtbar wolkig ziehend*), at once dense and evocative, demonstrates just how closely Goethe echoes the particular expressive qualities of Persian poetry.

106. [97](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn97){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_97} The cup-bearer (*sāqī* in Arabic and Persian), often evoked in the *ghazal*, is a standard figure, at once a disciple and an object of desire (as well as a youth eager for instruction).

107. [98](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn98){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_98} The cup-bearer lingers in the hope of garnering some wisdom from the (increasingly tipsy) poet and sage.

108. [99](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn99){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_99} 'down' signifies the onset of maturity. Sufis often practised a kind of cult of the 'beardless youth' that entailed a rapt gaze at a handsome young man in which a sublimated sexual longing sought 'the beauty of God' in human form.

109. [100](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn100){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_100} 'hints': Goethe here alludes to the Sufi practice whereby the master taught not only by words but by gestures and hints (*ishārāt* in Arabic); for example, by casting the glance upwards instead of merely saying 'heaven'.

110. [101](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn101){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_101} Rulers and their viziers often summoned Sufi masters to court in order to benefit by their wisdom and perception; and sometimes, too, for the pleasure of being scolded and rebuked by them.

111. [102](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn102){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_102} This is Poem 29 in The Book of Love of the *Divan*.

112. [103](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn103){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_103} This is *Tefkir Nameh*, the fourth book of the *Divan*.

113. [104](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn104){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_104} *Rendsch Nameh*, the fifth book of the *Divan*, i.e., *ranj*, a Persian word meaning 'care, pain, turmoil, annoyance', etc.

114. [105](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn105){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_105} As usual, Goethe refers to himself here as 'the poet' or the 'Western poet'.

115. [106](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn106){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_106} German *Aufschneiderey*.

116. [107](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn107){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_107} The *Hikmet Nameh*, the sixth book of the *Divan*.

117. [108](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn108){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_108} The *Timur Nameh*, the seventh book of the *Divan*. Timur (also known as Tamburlaine) may be seen as a surrogate for Napoleon.

118. [109](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn109){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_109} Nasr al-Dīn Hoja is a clownish figure to whom many jokes and antics are attributed in Turkish popular and folk literature; he was often portrayed as a boon companion or jester to Timur.

119. [110](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn110){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_110} German *nicht geckenhaft zudringlich*.

120. [111](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn111){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_111} *Saki Nameh*, the ninth book of the *Divan*.

121. [112](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn112){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_112} For the original story, which is quite different from Goethe's version, see *The Gulistan of Sa῾dī*, trans. Wheeler M. Thackston (Bethesda: Ibex, 2008), pp. 114--6.

122. [113](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn113){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_113} In the original tale, it is of course a mosque which the narrator enters.

123. [114](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn114){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_114} The sentence, in Arabic, is a typical example from a grammar book.

124. [115](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn115){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_115} In the original, Sa‛dī quotes the following verse, 'I saw a great one in the mountains who had renounced the world and lived in a cave' \[*Buzurgī dīdam andar kūhsārī qinā‛at kardeh az dunyā be-ghārī*\], which makes more sense than Goethe's version; cf. *Gulistān*, p. 116.

125. [116](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn116){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_116} For the original, see *Gulistān*, p. 117.

128. [119](#Chapter_52.xhtml_chfn119){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_119} The twelfth and final book of the *Divan*.

129. [120](#Chapter_53.xhtml_chfn120){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_120} Goethe is referring to Book Four of his autobiography *Dichtung und Wahrheit* ('Poetry and Truth').

130. [121](#Chapter_53.xhtml_chfn121){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_121} Referring to the Pentateuch, i.e., Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deutoronomy.

131. [122](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn122){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_122} Goethe here inserts parts of an essay he had written in 1797.

132. [123](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn123){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_123} Exodus 1:8.

133. [124](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn124){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_124} Genesis 49:5--7. Goethe here follows the 1545 Luther translation almost verbatim; cf. *Die gantze Heilige Schrift* (Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, 1974), vol. 1, p. 118.

134. [125](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn125){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_125} Exodus 2:16--22.

135. [126](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn126){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_126} A tributary of the Dead Sea. By 'the little gulf' Goethe presumably designates the Gulf of Aqaba.

136. [127](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn127){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_127} This refers to the uprising of Sicilians against the French occupying forces on 30 March 1282. For Goethe, it was 'in reverse' because the Israelites were 'strangers' among the Egyptians, unlike the Sicilians under their overlords of Anjou.

137. [128](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn128){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_128} This seems to be Goethe's own interpretation of Exodus 12:23--30 since in the biblical account, it is 'the Lord' who strikes down the first-born of Egypt, not the Israelites themselves.

138. [129](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn129){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_129} See Exodus 18:13--27.

139. [130](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn130){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_130} *Gelüstgräber*, i.e., 'the graves of greed' \[*qibroth hatta'avah*\], where 'they buried the people who had been greedy for meat.' Cf. Numbers 11:34.

140. [131](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn131){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_131} See Genesis 13:18.

141. [132](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn132){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_132} For Oboth and Iyim, see Numbers 33:43--45.

142. [133](#Chapter_54.xhtml_chfn133){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_133} The suggestion that Joshua and Caleb murdered Moses, which seems to have sprung from Goethe's own fevered imagination, has no basis in the biblical texts. Freud later applauded it as an astute insight in his 'Der Mann Moses und die monotheistische Religion' in *Werke aus den Jahren 1932--1939*, ed. Anna Freud (Frankfurt, 1972, pp. 101--246). *Moses and Monotheism* (London: The Hogarth Press, 1939), p. 144.

144. [135](#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn135){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_135} Again, by the 'arabischer Meerbusen', Goethe presumably refers to the Gulf of Aqaba.

145. [136](#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn136){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_136} A reference to Nicolas Sanson (1600--67), French geographer and the author of *Geographia sacra* (1652).

146. [137](#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn137){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_137} This is Augustine Calmet (1672--1757), a Benedictine scholar, author of the *Dictionarium historicum, geographicum et literale sacrae scripturae* (1729).

147. [138](#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn138){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_138} Edward Well (or Wells) (1667--1727), English mathematician, theologian and geographer.

148. [139](#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn139){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_139} Jean-Baptiste Nolin (1686--1762), Parisian cartographer and engraver.

149. [140](#Chapter_55.xhtml_chfn140){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_140} Cf. Matthew 4:2.

150. [141](#Chapter_56.xhtml_chfn141){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_141} For Michaelis, see note 75 above; for Eichhorn, see note 3 above. Heinrich Eberhard Gottlob Paulus (1761--1851) was Eichhorn's successor and professor of oriental languages at Jena; in his biblical commentaries he was controversial for his vigorous espousal of 'theological rationalism'. He also published an Arabic grammar. Arnold Heeren (1760--1842) was a professor of philosophy, then of ancient history, in Göttingen, who set great emphasis on the role of economics in history; Goethe owned several of his books and borrowed others from the library in Weimar.

151. [142](#Chapter_58.xhtml_chfn142){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_142} According to Marco Polo, the coinage of the Khan was neither of gold nor of silver but of other metals as well as of such materials as tree-bark; cf. his *Travels*, translated by Nigel Cliff (London: Penguin, 2015), p. 124.

152. [143](#Chapter_59.xhtml_chfn143){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_143} This is John Mandeville (1300--72), of obscure nationality, either English or Belgian, whose *Voyage d'outre mer* was influential and much read.

153. [144](#Chapter_59.xhtml_chfn144){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_144} The *Volksbuch*, or 'People's Book', was a genre of popular historical writing, usually in prose.

154. [145](#Chapter_59.xhtml_chfn145){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_145} The allusion is to Judges 14:18.

155. [146](#Chapter_59.xhtml_chfn146){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_146} The reference is to Joseph Görres, *Die teutschen Volksbücher* (Heidelberg, 1807), a book which Goethe owned.

156. [147](#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn147){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_147} He recounted his travels in his *Viaggi di Pietro della Valle il Pellegrino, Descritti da lui medesimo in Lettere familiari* (Rome, 1650--3). Goethe first read him in 1806 in Italian and then, over the years 1815 to 1819, in German translation.

157. [148](#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn148){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_148} Goethe here uses the word *capighi*, derived from Turkish *kapıcı* meaning 'porter' or 'concierge'.

158. [149](#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn149){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_149} 'The lovely Maani', who becomes Pietro della Valle's wife, is learned in pharmacology and medicine.

159. [150](#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn150){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_150} This is important presumably because his wife's familiarity with the women gives della Valle information about their practices to which as a man he would not have access.

160. [151](#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn151){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_151} Actually, ῾Abbās I ibn Muḥammad Khudābanda (reigned 1587--1629); ῾Abbās II (reigned 1642--66) was his great-grandson.

161. [152](#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn152){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_152} It isn't clear whether Goethe here means Sir Anthony Shirley (1565-- c.1635), whom ῾Abbās the Great (Shāh ῾Abbās) sent as an envoy to Europe in 1599, or his brother Robert (died 1628) who stayed at court as a hostage during his brother's mission and was later sent on two missions of his own to Europe on behalf of the Persian silk trade.

162. [153](#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn153){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_153} This is the ceremony in the Armenian rite which takes place on 5 January during which the cross is immersed in water for a day in order to provide baptismal water for the coming year.

163. [154](#Chapter_60.xhtml_chfn154){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_154} Goethe here refers to the fact that at Muhammad's death in 632, his cousin and son-in-law ῾Alī, his closest male blood relative, was passed over as his successor in favour of three older but unrelated claimants: Abu Bakr, ῾Umar and ῾Uthmān. ῾Alī acceded to the caliphate only in 656. Sunni Muslims consider these the four 'rightly guided caliphs', or *rashidūn*, whereas Shi῾i Muslims reject the claims of the first three, dismissing them as tyrannous usurpers. ῾Alī was murdered in the mosque of Kufa in 661 by a disaffected extremist, thereby becoming the first and foremost of the murdered Imams of the Shi῾a.

B. Tavernier* (Paris, 1676), in two volumes. Jean Chardin (1643--1713) was a Parisian businessman and scholar who travelled frequently to Persia and East India; in Persia, ῾Abbās II appointed him goldsmith to the royal court. His *Voyages en Perse* first appeared in partial form in London in 1686; the complete work was finally published in 1735 in Holland.

[163](#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn163){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_163} Georg Wilhelm Lorsbach (1752--1816) worked closely with Goethe in the early years of the composition of the *Divan*, serving the poet as a scholarly consultant until his death in 1816; Goethe admired his erudition but considered his powers of appreciation limited.

173. [164](#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn164){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_164} Heinrich Friedrich von Diez (1751--1817) served as Prussian envoy to Constantinople from 1784 until 1790, when he was recalled; he was appointed prelate to the cathedral chapter of Kolberg. He had assembled a large collection of Arabic, Persian and Turkish manuscripts, from which he was able to extract and translate the *Book of Qābūs*, published in 1811.

Kay Kāwūs and his son Gīlān Shāh were the last of the Ziyarid rulers in Tabaristan; the line was extirpated by the Nizarī Ismā῾īlīs around 1090; cf.

178. [169](#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn169){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_169} Josef von Hammer (1774--1856) -- after 1835, known as Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall -- was one of the leading scholars of the day. It was through his translations of Ḥāfiẓ, which appeared in two volumes in 1814, that Goethe got to know the work of the Persian poet (who had interested him for years).

179. [170](#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn170){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_170} This refers to von Hammer's publication *Fundgruben des Orients*, which served as a scholarly forum on all matters pertaining to the Near East, including numerous translations from Near Eastern languages, and to which leading authorities from all over Europe contributed; it was published in six volumes (Vienna, 1809--18). It was one of the most important sources for Goethe in composing the *Divan*.

180. [171](#Chapter_65.xhtml_chfn171){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_171} A reference to von Hammer's poem *Schirin. Ein persisches romantisches Gedicht nach persischen und türkischen Quellen* ('Shirin: a Persian Romantic Poem after Persian and Turkish Sources') which appeared in Leipzig in 1809. Notwithstanding this praise, Goethe had no high opinion of von Hammer's poetic ability. In a posthumously published 'Invective', he wrote:

181. Lord Byron ohne Scham und Scheu

182. Hat sich satanischen Pakts beflissen.

183. Von Hammer merkt nun wohl, dass, um Poet zu sein,

184. Er sich dem Teufel hätt' ergeben müssen.

185. ('Lord Byron made a satanic pact, without any shame or diffidence. Von Hammer knows very well that to be a poet he'd have to give himself utterly up to the Devil.' See Birus, vol. 2, p. 159).

I have found this translation very helpful even if I have not followed it throughout. (I am indebted to the Goethe scholar Dr Elizabeth Powers for this reference.)

188. [174](#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn174){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_174} Goethe is using the word 'parody' in its original Greek sense as 'imitation'.

190. [176](#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn176){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_176} The poet Christoph Martin Wieland (1733--1813) translated Shakespeare, Horace and Aristophanes into German.

191. [177](#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn177){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_177} Johann Heinrich Voß (1751--1826) was a prolific translator of the classics; his translations of Homer into German hexameters have long been admired.

192. [178](#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn178){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_178} The criticism is directed at the translations by Samuel Friedrich Günther Wahl (1760 --1834), an Orientalist in Halle.

193. [179](#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn179){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_179} This is the drama *Shakuntala* by the great Indian poet Kālidāsa (c. 400 ce), translated in 1788 from the Sanskrit into English by Sir William Jones and then, in 1791, by Friedrich Georg Forster into German.

194. [180](#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn180){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_180} The *Meghadūta*, a poem in 111 stanzas, is considered the lyrical masterpiece of Kālidāsa. It was translated into English in 1814 by Horace Hayman Wilson (1786--1860).

195. [181](#Chapter_66.xhtml_chfn181){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_181} Johann Gottfried Ludwig Kosegarten (1792--1860) was a theologian and Orientalist who had studied in Paris under the great Silvestre de Sacy. He assisted Goethe with the Notes to the *Divan*.

196. [182](#Chapter_67.xhtml_chfn182){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_182} The Persian ambassador was Abū al-Ḥasan Khān Shīrāzī. The empress was the Tsar's mother, Maria Feodorovna (1759--1828), born the Princess of Wūrttemberg.

197. [183](#Chapter_67.xhtml_chfn183){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_183} This poem and the one that follows are given in Persian with the German versions *en face*. Both appeared in von Hammer's *Fundgruben des Orients*, vol. 6, p. 216f. Here Goethe reproduces the Persian text but replaces von Hammer's German translation with that of Kosegarten. Fath ῾Alī Shāh of the Persian Qajar dynasty ruled from 1797 to 1834. Goethe's Persian verses contain a number of infelicities but are given here as he wrote them.

198. [184](#Chapter_67.xhtml_chfn184){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_184} Fath ῾Alī Shāh had established 'The Order of the Sun', of which this is the emblem.

199. [185](#Chapter_67.xhtml_chfn185){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_185} Mānī (c. 216--76 ad), the Persian Gnostic who founded Manichaeism and was executed under the Sasanians, was also famed as a painter.

200. [186](#Chapter_68.xhtml_chfn186){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_186} Barthélemy d'Herbelot (1625--95), trained as a classicist, turned to the study of Oriental languages, including Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Persian and Turkish; his *Bibliothèque orientale, ou Dictionnaire universel*, published posthumously in 1697, contained alphabetically arranged entries on Oriental subjects drawn from Arabic, Persian and Turkish sources. It is no dry work of pedantry but filled with lively anecdotes and character sketches. Goethe borrowed it from the library in Weimar in 1814 several times over a five-year period; it was one of the main sources for the poems in the *Divan* as well as for his Notes.

201. [187](#Chapter_68.xhtml_chfn187){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_187} The word is now transliterated into English as *hijra* (or *hijrah*). In German it is now transliterated as Hidschra.

202. [188](#Chapter_68.xhtml_chfn188){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_188} In the German text, Kosegarten's index follows but is not translated here.

203. [189](#Chapter_69.xhtml_chfn189){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_189} Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy (1758--1838) was easily the greatest Orientalist of his day; he published a number of texts and studies, many of which are still valuable, and he trained several of the leading nineteenth-century scholars. The poem dedicated to him here is given in Arabic followed by the German version which differs considerably. The Arabic verses read literally: 'O book! Go to our illustrious master/ then greet him with this page/ which is the book's beginning and its end/ that is, its beginning is in the East and its end is in the West.'

204. [190](#Chapter_69.xhtml_chfn190){#Notes.xhtml_chfn_190} The quatrain is given in Persian, then in German. Goethe took the lines from the conclusion of Sa‛dī's *Gulistān* ('Rose Garden') which reads: 'We have given advice in its proper place; we spent much time on this labour./ If it is not heard with avidity's ear, the messenger's duty is to deliver the message -- that's enough!' (For the Persian text -- and a somewhat different translation -- see *The Gulistan of Sa*‛*di*, trans. Thackston, p. 173.)

1.  [1](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn1){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_1} An allusion to *Hamlet*, IV, 5: 'They say the owl was a baker's daughter.'
2.  [2](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn2){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_2} The poem was drafted on 26 July 1814. By 'Vision' Goethe wants to convey the effect for a traveller that his coach is like 'a little house' (*Häuschen*) which seems to stand still while it is the landscape that appears to move past the window of the coach. He later entitled the poem 'The New Copernicus'.
3.  [3](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn3){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_3} Goethe here plays on *Huren* ('whores') and *houris*, those heavenly consorts promised to the Muslim faithful and whose virginity was continually renewed.
4.  [4](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn4){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_4} Another irreverent note: the juxtaposition of the 'whores' whose virginity is renewed with the Virgin Mary, who remained a virgin though she bore a son.
5.  [5](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn5){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_5} x + y: mathematical symbols denoting 'unknowns' in blasphemous conjunction with Mary's virginity; as Birus notes (vol. 2, p. 1746), the metre of the poem requires reading 'x und u' with the associated idiom 'ein x für ein u vormachen', i.e., 'to deceive someone in the crassest way'.
6.  [6](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn6){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_6} This isolated line probably does not belong in the *Divan*; cf. Birus, vol. 2: p. 1748.

12. [12](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn12){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_12} Apparently an attack on the 'Catholic Nazarenes' of the time who refused to mourn the suffering and crucifixion of Christ but instead glorified them.
13. [13](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn13){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_13} This is the draft of a poem written, in dactylic tetrameter, between 21 and 27 May 1815, but never completed or included in the *Divan*.
14. [14](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn14){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_14} 'And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.' (1 Kings 10:2).
15. [15](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn15){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_15} The reference is to i Kings 7:21: 'And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.'
16. [16](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn16){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_16} 'the devils', i.e., Iblīs, or Satan. Goethe puts the word in the plural, perhaps to designate the *jinn* who are hostile to human beings. For Goethe too the poem is a parable of the fragility and vulnerability of all that purports to be perfect.
17. [17](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn17){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_17} Eilfer was a Rhine wine that Goethe drank first on October 10, 1815, after the break with Marianne, in an effort to console himself. The vintage of 1811 which he celebrates was considered an exceptional year for Rhine wine. He evokes the same wine in The Book of Hafiz and The Book of the Cup-Bearer. Goethe left the poem untitled in both drafts.
18. [18](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn18){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_18} Immanuel Kant (1724--1804), the great philosopher and Goethe's older contemporary.

22. [22](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn22){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_22} This is a much more accomplished version of the preceding poem. Goethe retains the *ghazal* rhyme but also rhymes the alternating lines while the metre has been made less rollicking.
23. [23](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn23){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_23} *ein Römer*: a 'Roman glass' (*Römerglas*') is a small goblet with a coiled green stem, used for white wine, especially Riesling and Mosel.

25. [25](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn25){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_25} 'Men who weep are good.' Taken from the *Adagia* of Erasmus (*Boni viri lacrimabile*), a maxim Goethe also cited in his *Wahlverwandtshaften*.

27. [27](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn27){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_27} Xerxes wept at the sight of his army in Abydos, and at the brevity of human life; Alexander killed his dearest friend at a drunken banquet in a moment of rage and regretted it ever after.
28. [28](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn28){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_28} In old Arabic poetry shedding tears in the desert at the memory of a beloved is a standard trope. In this unrhymed poem of variable measures Goethe shows the influence of the pre-Islamic poet Imru'l-Qays whose famous ode William Jones had translated into English and which Goethe then translated into German.
29. [29](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn29){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_29} Goethe based both drafts of this fragment on an Oguz tale of a cyclops as recounted by Diez in his *Der neuentdeckte oghuzische Cyklop verglichen mit dem Homerischen* (Halle and Berlin, 1815), later incorporated in his *Denkwürdigkeiten von Asien* under the title '*Depé Ghöz oder der oghuzische Cyklop. Aus dem Tatarisch-Türkischen*'. On 12 July 1815, Goethe commented, 'Among other things you will encounter a complete tale of a cyclops from Central Asia which very probably Homer had heard about in order to represent his Polyphemus, in however abbreviated a version, accordingly.' (For further details, see Birus, vol. 2, pp. 1779--84.)
30. [30](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn30){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_30} An ocean-going ship is often invoked in the poems of Ḥāfiẓ. For Goethe, the Persian poet wrote under the sign of water while he himself wrote under that of fire, hence the contrast here. And yet (as Rychner notes), he wrote: '*Alles ist aus dem Wasser entsprungen!!/ Alles wird durch das Wasser erhalten!*' (Everything has sprung from the water!! Everything is sustained by water!) (*Faust* II: l. 8435)
31. [31](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn31){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_31} Goethe here uses the classical form of the elegiac couplet, with echoes of Propertius. This consists of a first line in hexameter followed by a shorter pentameter line. A famous example is Coleridge's translation of a couplet by Schiller: 'In the hexameter rises the fountain's silvery column/ In the pentameter aye falling in melody back.' This couplet reworks a translation of a poem by the Ottoman Sultan Selim which Goethe found in Diez's *Denkwürdigkeiten von Asien*, vol. 1, p. 255.
32. [32](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn32){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_32} This refers to the winding of the turban around the head; the fragment may have been meant to go with the poem *Komm, Liebchen, komm! umwinde mir die Mütze...* (see Poem 116 above) as it has the same metre.
33. [33](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn33){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_33} A famous and much-cited saying in Sufi literature.
34. [34](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn34){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_34} The lines make sense only when connected with Poem 30 and the winding on of the turban. Note, too, the play on the word *Stand* (place) in both.
35. [35](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn35){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_35} *Ta*῾*līq*, the 'hanging' style, is an elegant cursive hand in Arabic and Persian calligraphy. In the next line, *naskhī* designates the 'normal' hand of Arabic calligraphy (which Goethe had learned to read and write).
36. [36](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn36){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_36} The first two stanzas are in the voice of Marianne, the 'sick person'; she had sent Goethe an encoded letter which when he deciphered it turned out to be a brief poem complaining of his silence.
37. [37](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn37){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_37} The Arabic verses were written by Goethe in Arabic script. Khan is a title for a Mongol ruler.
38. [38](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn38){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_38} This poem follows on the preceding one: the beloved has received a message at last.
39. [39](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn39){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_39} The speaker of this poem, according to Goethe, is the Sasanian king Chosroes II (590--628), a Zoroastrian whose wife was a Christian. Here, in adopting the attitude of the Sasanian king, Goethe expresses his own complex, and conflicted, attitude towards Christianity, at least in its official versions. It may be recalled that in his *Venetian Epigrams* he listed 'the Cross' among those things, such as tobacco smoke and garlic, that repelled him. For Goethe's views on Christian belief, see the Introduction below, pp. xix and xxii.

43. [43](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn43){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_43} This refers to the *Qābūs-nāma* by Kay-Kāwūs, described as 'a manual of correct behaviour for courtiers', written in 1082 at the court of Ghazna.

47. [47](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn47){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_47} The poem, written on 19 March 1818, was originally to form part of The Book of Ill-Humour. A hostile reaction to Goethe had set in during his lifetime, to which he responded in several poems.

49. [49](#Appendix.xhtml_appfn49){#Notes.xhtml_appfn_49} The poem turns on the fact that when Goethe requested the comb, he also asked for a lock of Marianne's hair but she sent him only the comb.

1.  [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen1){#Notes.xhtml_appen_1} The poems in this appendix were written at the same time as those in the *Divan* but were not included by Goethe (though after his death, his editors did include them in the 1836 edition, distributing individual poems among the different books). Despite Goethe's exclusion, some of his loveliest, and most musical, lyrics are found here. The German texts and the translations here follow the Birus edition, vol. 1, pp. 585--615, based on manuscripts in Goethe's hand. I have omitted the 'cipher poems' on pp. 596--7 and 601, 605 and 607, since they consist only of lists of numbers, keyed to von Hammer's translations of Ḥāfiẓ; Goethe and Marianne exchanged these lists as coded messages.
2.  [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen2){#Notes.xhtml_appen_2} This brief poem, written on 21 June 1814, is in Adonaean metre (--- ∪ ∪ --- ∪).
3.  [†](#Appendix.xhtml_appen3){#Notes.xhtml_appen_3} Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia in central Germany, was a city which Goethe visited in his youth in the 1770s and where he recalled spending happy days. It was in Erfurt too that he met Napoleon, on 2 October 1808 on the occasion of the Royal Congress. For Goethe's account of the meeting in his own words, see Peter Boerner, *Goethe* (London: Haus Publishing, 2005), pp.78--80. This poem was drafted on 25 July 1814 in Erfurt.
4.  [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen4){#Notes.xhtml_appen_4} *gemein* is 'low, rough, common' but here there is an echo of *Gemeinde*, 'congregation' to reinforce the blasphemous nature of the poem. The poem, written between 26 and 29 July 1814, betrays Goethe's interest at that time in Muslim conceptions of paradise but perhaps because of its mocking tone it was unsuitable for Book 12 of the Divan (The Book of Paradise) and in any case was left unfinished.
5.  [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen5){#Notes.xhtml_appen_5} According to Rychner (p. 568), the poem was written in 1814; in Birus (vol. 1, p. 588), it is given as the second stanza of the 'fragment' beginning 'Dass des Hauses Glanz sich mehre...'.
6.  [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen6){#Notes.xhtml_appen_6} The italicised letters in this and other poems in the Appendix are reconstructions by later editors, mostly inferred from the rhyme scheme and metre.
7.  [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen7){#Notes.xhtml_appen_7} Fragment of a poem drafted between 23 December 1814 and 1 January 1815 in unrhymed trochaic measure; it is a reworking of a Persian song about the last ruler of the Zand dynasty, Luṭf ‛Alī Khān (reigned 1788-- 96), which Goethe took from Edward Scott Waring, *Reise nach Sheeraz auf dem Wege von Kazroon und Feerozabad*, as translated from the English original (Rudolstadt, 1809), in two volumes; vol. 1, p. 153f. Kerman is a south-eastern province of Iran; Māzandarān a province south of the Caspian Sea. Tubus is the city of Ṭabas in the south of the province of Khorasan.
8.  [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen8){#Notes.xhtml_appen_8} Dou-Rouy, in Persian *do rūy* ('two faces'), a mountain with two contrasting faces but also a flower: someone who is two-faced is said to resemble the flower. Goethe took this reference from a passage in A.L. Chézy's *Medjnoun et Leila* (Paris, 1807), his French translation of Jāmī's *Majnūn and Laylā,* and especially, the mention of the *khālkhāl,* the tinkling rings of gold or silver that women wear on their ankles.
9.  [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen9){#Notes.xhtml_appen_9} From a manuscript in Goethe's hand, written at the beginning of March 1815. The orthography is Goethe's (*uberschritten*: *überschritten*).
10. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen10){#Notes.xhtml_appen_10} The letters in italics are conjectural readings.
11. [†](#Appendix.xhtml_appen11){#Notes.xhtml_appen_11} A fragment in trochaic metre drawn from Sa‛dī in Olearius' translation of 1654, pp. 152ff.
12. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen12){#Notes.xhtml_appen_12} *prachern*: to bargain aggressively
13. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen13){#Notes.xhtml_appen_13} *stöst*: *stößt*
14. [†](#Appendix.xhtml_appen14){#Notes.xhtml_appen_14} *Schmitz*: *Makel*, *Befleckung*
15. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen15){#Notes.xhtml_appen_15} Text as in Birus (vol. 1, pp. 598--600) with Goethe's spellings and lack of punctuation.
16. [†](#Appendix.xhtml_appen16){#Notes.xhtml_appen_16} The poem takes the form of a *ghazal* with the recurrent rhyme on 'Eilfer' but at the same time using a rollicking ballad metre.
17. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen17){#Notes.xhtml_appen_17} *'S*: *Es*
18. [†](#Appendix.xhtml_appen18){#Notes.xhtml_appen_18} *süs*: *süß*
19. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen19){#Notes.xhtml_appen_19} This poem is Goethe's reworking of a 'cipher-letter' from Marianne von Willemer, dated 18 October 1815, which she composed in response to his cipher-letter of 10 October 1815. Goethe had written ![image](images/pg588.jpg){.mid} (*Ṣulayḥatun*) in vocalised Arabic at the heading of the letter, mistakenly believing that this was the correct form of Suleika (![image](images/pg588-1.jpg){.mid} in Persian) -- a mistake that Marianne repeated in her reply.
20. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen20){#Notes.xhtml_appen_20} *ahnden*: *ahnen*
21. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen21){#Notes.xhtml_appen_21} *erschriegt* (Middle High German): *erschreckt.* A deliberately archaic usage.
22. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen22){#Notes.xhtml_appen_22} Written on 22 December 1815.
23. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen23){#Notes.xhtml_appen_23} Written to Marianne on 13 March 1816 'in the evening at 10:00', as Goethe notes. He appended the note 'Im Jahr der Welten II,163.5.8'. The notation was devised by Marianne to denote her and Goethe's reunion in Heidelberg (but the II can be read also as 'H'.) The '163.5.8' is a reference to von Hammer's translation of Ḥāfiẓ, as used by the lovers in their cipher-poems.
24. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen24){#Notes.xhtml_appen_24} This poem, written in March 1815, though not properly one of the posthumous poems, was included in the *Manigfaltige Glieder -- 1815* but finally excluded from the *Divan*.
25. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen25){#Notes.xhtml_appen_25} *eräugnen*: *ereignen*
26. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen26){#Notes.xhtml_appen_26} Dedicated to Heinrich Friedrich von Diez, whose *Buch des Kabus oder Lehren des persischen Königs Kjekjawus für seinen Sohn Ghilan Shach* (Berlin, 1811) Goethe drew on in several poems. He pays tribute to von Diez in the 'Notes and Essays' as well, praising his translation of The Book of Qabus about which Goethe says, 'I devoted a great deal of time to it...' (see 'Notes and Essays'*,* pp. 487--93). The two stanzas here represent two drafts of the same poem.
27. [†](#Appendix.xhtml_appen27){#Notes.xhtml_appen_27} Chadsche (or Chadshah) is Nasr al-Dīn Hoja, Timur Lenk's jester and holy fool.
28. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen28){#Notes.xhtml_appen_28} Originally meant for inclusion in the 1827 edition, this poem (and the variant of Poem 231) were excluded in the end.
29. [\*](#Appendix.xhtml_appen29){#Notes.xhtml_appen_29} The last line is to be understood as '*geh und melde dies*'.
