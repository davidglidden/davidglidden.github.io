# Introduction {#calibre_link-274 .chaphead1}
:::

This book is an attack on current city planning and rebuilding. It is
also, and mostly, an attempt to introduce new principles of city
planning and rebuilding, different and even opposite from those now
taught in everything from schools of architecture and planning to the
Sunday supplements and women's magazines. My attack is not based on
quibbles about rebuilding methods or hair-splitting about fashions in
design. It is an attack, rather, on the principles and aims that have
shaped modern, orthodox city planning and rebuilding.

In setting forth different principles, I shall mainly be writing about
common, ordinary things: for instance, what kinds of city streets are
safe and what kinds are not; why some city parks are marvelous and
others are vice traps and death traps; why some slums stay slums and
other slums regenerate themselves even against financial and official
opposition; what makes downtowns shift their centers; what, if anything,
is a city neighborhood, and []{#calibre_link-277 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="4"}what jobs, if any, neighborhoods in great
cities do. In short, I shall be writing about how cities work in real
life, because this is the only way to learn what principles of planning
and what practices in rebuilding can promote social and economic
vitality in cities, and what practices and principles will deaden these
attributes.

There is a wistful myth that if only we had enough money to spend---the
figure is usually put at a hundred billion dollars---we could wipe out
all our slums in ten years, reverse decay in the great, dull, gray belts
that were yesterday's and day-before-yesterday's suburbs, anchor the
wandering middle class and its wandering tax money, and perhaps even
solve the traffic problem.

But look what we have built with the first several billions: Low-income
projects that become worse centers of delinquency, vandalism and general
social hopelessness than the slums they were supposed to replace.
Middle-income housing projects which are truly marvels of dullness and
regimentation, sealed against any buoyancy or vitality of city life.
Luxury housing projects that mitigate their inanity, or try to, with a
vapid vulgarity. Cultural centers that are unable to support a good
bookstore. Civic centers that are avoided by everyone but bums, who have
fewer choices of loitering place than others. Commercial centers that
are lackluster imitations of standardized suburban chain-store shopping.
Promenades that go from no place to nowhere and have no promenaders.
Expressways that eviscerate great cities. This is not the rebuilding of
cities. This is the sacking of cities.

Under the surface, these accomplishments prove even poorer than their
poor pretenses. They seldom aid the city areas around them, as in theory
they are supposed to. These amputated areas typically develop galloping
gangrene. To house people in this planned fashion, price tags are
fastened on the population, and each sorted-out chunk of price-tagged
populace lives in growing suspicion and tension against the surrounding
city. When two or more such hostile islands are juxtaposed the result is
called "a balanced neighborhood." Monopolistic shopping centers and
monumental cultural centers cloak, under the public relations hoohaw,
the subtraction of commerce, and of culture too, from the intimate and
casual life of cities.

[]{#calibre_link-282 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="5"}That such
wonders may be accomplished, people who get marked with the planners'
hex signs are pushed about, expropriated, and uprooted much as if they
were the subjects of a conquering power. Thousands upon thousands of
small businesses are destroyed, and their proprietors ruined, with
hardly a gesture at compensation. Whole communities are torn apart and
sown to the winds, with a reaping of cynicism, resentment and despair
that must be heard and seen to be believed. A group of clergymen in
Chicago, appalled at the fruits of planned city rebuilding there, asked,

> Could Job have been thinking of Chicago when he wrote:
>
> Here are men that alter their neighbor's landmark...shoulder the poor
> aside, conspire to oppress the friendless.
>
> Reap they the field that is none of theirs, strip they the vineyard
> wrongfully seized from its owner...
>
> A cry goes up from the city streets, where wounded men lie groaning...

If so, he was also thinking of New York, Philadelphia, Boston,
Washington, St. Louis, San Francisco and a number of other places. The
economic rationale of current city rebuilding is a hoax. The economics
of city rebuilding do not rest soundly on reasoned investment of public
tax subsidies, as urban renewal theory proclaims, but also on vast,
involuntary subsidies wrung out of helpless site victims. And the
increased tax returns from such sites, accruing to the cities as a
result of this "investment," are a mirage, a pitiful gesture against the
ever increasing sums of public money needed to combat disintegration and
instability that flow from the cruelly shaken-up city. The means to
planned city rebuilding are as deplorable as the ends.

Meantime, all the art and science of city planning are helpless to stem
decay---and the spiritlessness that precedes decay---in ever more
massive swatches of cities. Nor can this decay be laid, reassuringly, to
lack of opportunity to apply the arts of planning. It seems to matter
little whether they are applied or not. Consider the Morningside Heights
area in New York City. According to []{#calibre_link-289 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="6"}planning theory it should not be in trouble
at all, for it enjoys a great abundance of parkland, campus, playground
and other open spaces. It has plenty of grass. It occupies high and
pleasant ground with magnificent river views. It is a famous educational
center with splendid institutions---Columbia University, Union
Theological Seminary, the Juilliard School of Music, and half a dozen
others of eminent respectability. It is the beneficiary of good
hospitals and churches. It has no industries. Its streets are zoned in
the main against "incompatible uses" intruding into the preserves for
solidly constructed, roomy, middle- and upper-class apartments. Yet by
the early 1950's Morningside Heights was becoming a slum so swiftly, the
surly kind of slum in which people fear to walk the streets, that the
situation posed a crisis for the institutions. They and the planning
arms of the city government got together, applied more planning theory,
wiped out the most run-down part of the area and built in its stead a
middle-income cooperative project complete with shopping center, and a
public housing project, all interspersed with air, light, sunshine and
landscaping. This was hailed as a great demonstration in city saving.

After that, Morningside Heights went downhill even faster.

Nor is this an unfair or irrelevant example. In city after city,
precisely the wrong areas, in the light of planning theory, are
decaying. Less noticed, but equally significant, in city after city the
wrong areas, in the light of planning theory, are refusing to decay.

Cities are an immense laboratory of trial and error, failure and
success, in city building and city design. This is the laboratory in
which city planning should have been learning and forming and testing
its theories. Instead the practitioners and teachers of this discipline
(if such it can be called) have ignored the study of success and failure
in real life, have been incurious about the reasons for unexpected
success, and are guided instead by principles derived from the behavior
and appearance of towns, suburbs, tuberculosis sanatoria, fairs, and
imaginary dream cities---from anything but cities themselves.

If it appears that the rebuilt portions of cities and the endless new
developments spreading beyond the cities are reducing city
[]{#calibre_link-294 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="7"}and
countryside alike to a monotonous, unnourishing gruel, this is not
strange. It all comes, first-, second-, third- or fourth-hand, out of
the same intellectual dish of mush, a mush in which the qualities,
necessities, advantages and behavior of great cities have been utterly
confused with the qualities, necessities, advantages and behavior of
other and more inert types of settlements.

There is nothing economically or socially inevitable about either the
decay of old cities or the fresh-minted decadence of the new unurban
urbanization. On the contrary, no other aspect of our economy and
society has been more purposefully manipulated for a full quarter of a
century to achieve precisely what we are getting. Extraordinary
governmental financial incentives have been required to achieve this
degree of monotony, sterility and vulgarity. Decades of preaching,
writing and exhorting by experts have gone into convincing us and our
legislators that mush like this must be good for us, as long as it comes
bedded with grass.

Automobiles are often conveniently tagged as the villains responsible
for the ills of cities and the disappointments and futilities of city
planning. But the destructive effects of automobiles are much less a
cause than a symptom of our incompetence at city building. Of course
planners, including the highwaymen with fabulous sums of money and
enormous powers at their disposal, are at a loss to make automobiles and
cities compatible with one another. They do not know what to do with
automobiles in cities because they do not know how to plan for workable
and vital cities anyhow---with or without automobiles.

The simple needs of automobiles are more easily understood and satisfied
than the complex needs of cities, and a growing number of planners and
designers have come to believe that if they can only solve the problems
of traffic, they will thereby have solved the major problem of cities.
Cities have much more intricate economic and social concerns than
automobile traffic. How can you know what to try with traffic until you
know how the city itself works, and what else it needs to do with its
streets? You can't.

It may be that we have become so feckless as a people that we no longer
care how things do work, but only what kind of quick
[]{#calibre_link-300 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="8"}easy outer
impression they give. If so, there is little hope for our cities or
probably for much else in our society. But I do not think this is so.

Specifically, in the case of planning for cities, it is clear that a
large number of good and earnest people do care deeply about building
and renewing. Despite some corruption, and considerable greed for the
other man's vineyard, the intentions going into the messes we make are,
on the whole, exemplary. Planners, architects of city design, and those
they have led along with them in their beliefs are not consciously
disdainful of the importance of knowing how things work. On the
contrary, they have gone to great pains to learn what the saints and
sages of modern orthodox planning have said about how cities *ought* to
work and what *ought* to be good for people and businesses in them. They
take this with such devotion that when contradictory reality intrudes,
threatening to shatter their dearly won learning, they must shrug
reality aside.

Consider, for example, the orthodox planning reaction to a district
called the North End in
Boston.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-35){#calibre_link-37 .calibre7} This is an
old, low-rent area merging into the heavy industry of the waterfront,
and it is officially considered Boston's worst slum and civic shame. It
embodies attributes which all enlightened people know are evil because
so many wise men have said they are evil. Not only is the North End
bumped right up against industry, but worse still it has all kinds of
working places and commerce mingled in the greatest complexity with its
residences. It has the highest concentration of dwelling units, on the
land that is used for dwelling units, of any part of Boston, and indeed
one of the highest concentrations to be found in any American city. It
has little parkland. Children play in the streets. Instead of
super-blocks, or even decently large blocks, it has very small blocks;
in planning parlance it is "badly cut up with wasteful streets." Its
buildings are old. Everything conceivable is presumably wrong with the
North End. In orthodox planning terms, it is a three-dimensional
textbook of "megalopolis" in the last stages of depravity. The North End
is thus a recurring assignment for M.I.T. and Harvard
[]{#calibre_link-303 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="9"}planning and
architectural students, who now and again pursue, under the guidance of
their teachers, the paper exercise of converting it into super-blocks
and park promenades, wiping away its nonconforming uses, transforming it
to an ideal of order and gentility so simple it could be engraved on the
head of a pin.

Twenty years ago, when I first happened to see the North End, its
buildings---town houses of different kinds and sizes converted to flats,
and four- or five-story tenements built to house the flood of immigrants
first from Ireland, then from Eastern Europe and finally from
Sicily---were badly overcrowded, and the general effect was of a
district taking a terrible physical beating and certainly desperately
poor.

When I saw the North End again in 1959, I was amazed at the change.
Dozens and dozens of buildings had been rehabilitated. Instead of
mattresses against the windows there were Venetian blinds and glimpses
of fresh paint. Many of the small, converted houses now had only one or
two families in them instead of the old crowded three or four. Some of
the families in the tenements (as I learned later, visiting inside) had
uncrowded themselves by throwing two older apartments together, and had
equipped these with bathrooms, new kitchens and the like. I looked down
a narrow alley, thinking to find at least here the old, squalid North
End, but no: more neatly repointed brickwork, new blinds, and a burst of
music as a door opened. Indeed, this was the only city district I had
ever seen---or have seen to this day---in which the sides of buildings
around parking lots had not been left raw and amputated, but repaired
and painted as neatly as if they were intended to be seen. Mingled all
among the buildings for living were an incredible number of splendid
food stores, as well as such enterprises as upholstery making, metal
working, carpentry, food processing. The streets were alive with
children playing, people shopping, people strolling, people talking. Had
it not been a cold January day, there would surely have been people
sitting.

The general street atmosphere of buoyancy, friendliness and good health
was so infectious that I began asking directions of people just for the
fun of getting in on some talk. I had seen a lot of Boston in the past
couple of days, most of it sorely distressing, and this struck me, with
relief, as the healthiest place in the []{#calibre_link-307 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="10"}city. But I could not imagine where the
money had come from for the rehabilitation, because it is almost
impossible today to get any appreciable mortgage money in districts of
American cities that are not either high-rent, or else imitations of
suburbs. To find out, I went into a bar and restaurant (where an
animated conversation about fishing was in progress) and called a Boston
planner I know.

"Why in the world are you down in the North End?" he said. "Money? Why,
no money or work has gone into the North End. Nothing's going on down
there. Eventually, yes, but not yet. That's a slum!"

"It doesn't seem like a slum to me," I said.

"Why, that's the worst slum in the city. It has two hundred and
seventy-five dwelling units to the net acre! I hate to admit we have
anything like that in Boston, but it's a fact."

"Do you have any other figures on it?" I asked.

"Yes, funny thing. It has among the lowest delinquency, disease and
infant mortality rates in the city. It also has the lowest ratio of rent
to income in the city. Boy, are those people getting bargains. Let's
see...the child population is just about average for the city, on the
nose. The death rate is low, 8.8 per thousand, against the average city
rate of 11.2. The TB death rate is very low, less than 1 per ten
thousand, can't understand it, it's lower even than Brookline's. In the
old days the North End used to be the city's worst spot for
tuberculosis, but all that has changed. Well, they must be strong
people. Of course it's a terrible slum."

"You should have more slums like this," I said. "Don't tell me there are
plans to wipe this out. You ought to be down here learning as much as
you can from it."

"I know how you feel," he said. "I often go down there myself just to
walk around the streets and feel that wonderful, cheerful street life.
Say, what you ought to do, you ought to come back and go down in the
summer if you think it's fun now. You'd be crazy about it in summer. But
of course we have to rebuild it eventually. We've got to get those
people off the streets."

Here was a curious thing. My friend's instincts told him the North End
was a good place, and his social statistics confirmed it. But everything
he had learned as a physical planner about what is []{#calibre_link-316
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="11"}good for people and good for city
neighborhoods, everything that made him an expert, told him the North
End had to be a bad place.

The leading Boston savings banker, "a man 'way up there in the power
structure," to whom my friend referred me for my inquiry about the
money, confirmed what I learned, in the meantime, from people in the
North End. The money had not come through the grace of the great
American banking system, which now knows enough about planning to know a
slum as well as the planners do. "No sense in lending money into the
North End," the banker said. "It's a slum! It's still getting some
immigrants! Furthermore, back in the Depression it had a very large
number of foreclosures; bad record." (I had heard about this too, in the
meantime, and how families had worked and pooled their resources to buy
back some of those foreclosed buildings.)

The largest mortgage loans that had been fed into this district of some
15,000 people in the quarter-century since the Great Depression were for
\$3,000, the banker told me, "and very, very few of those." There had
been some others for \$1,000 and for \$2,000. The rehabilitation work
had been almost entirely financed by business and housing earnings
within the district, plowed back in, and by skilled work bartered among
residents and relatives of residents.

By this time I knew that this inability to borrow for improvement was a
galling worry to North Enders, and that furthermore some North Enders
were worried because it seemed impossible to get new building in the
area except at the price of seeing themselves and their community wiped
out in the fashion of the students' dreams of a city Eden, a fate which
they knew was not academic because it had already smashed completely a
socially similar---although physically more spacious---nearby district
called the West End. They were worried because they were aware also that
patch and fix with nothing else could not do forever. "Any chance of
loans for new construction in the North End?" I asked the banker.

"No, absolutely not!" he said, sounding impatient at my denseness.
"That's a slum!"

Bankers, like planners, have theories about cities on which they
[]{#calibre_link-322 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="12"}act. They
have gotten their theories from the same intellectual sources as the
planners. Bankers and government administrative officials who guarantee
mortgages do not invent planning theories nor, surprisingly, even
economic doctrine about cities. They are enlightened nowadays, and they
pick up their ideas from idealists, a generation late. Since theoretical
city planning has embraced no major new ideas for considerably more than
a generation, theoretical planners, financers and bureaucrats are all
just about even today.

And to put it bluntly, they are all in the same stage of elaborately
learned superstition as medical science was early in the last century,
when physicians put their faith in bloodletting, to draw out the evil
humors which were believed to cause disease. With bloodletting, it took
years of learning to know precisely which veins, by what rituals, were
to be opened for what symptoms. A superstructure of technical
complication was erected in such deadpan detail that the literature
still sounds almost plausible. However, because people, even when they
are thoroughly enmeshed in descriptions of reality which are at variance
with reality, are still seldom devoid of the powers of observation and
independent thought, the science of bloodletting, over most of its long
sway, appears usually to have been tempered with a certain amount of
common sense. Or it was tempered until it reached its highest peaks of
technique in, of all places, the young United States. Bloodletting went
wild here. It had an enormously influential proponent in Dr. Benjamin
Rush, still revered as the greatest statesman-physician of our
revolutionary and federal periods, and a genius of medical
administration. Dr. Rush Got Things Done. Among the things he got done,
some of them good and useful, were to develop, practice, teach and
spread the custom of bloodletting in cases where prudence or mercy had
heretofore restrained its use. He and his students drained the blood of
very young children, of consumptives, of the greatly aged, of almost
anyone unfortunate enough to be sick in his realms of influence. His
extreme practices aroused the alarm and horror of European bloodletting
physicians. And yet as late as 1851, a committee appointed by the State
Legislature of New York solemnly defended the thoroughgoing use of
bloodletting. It scathingly ridiculed and []{#calibre_link-324 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="13"}censured a physician, William Turner, who
had the temerity to write a pamphlet criticizing Dr. Rush's doctrines
and calling "the practice of taking blood in diseases contrary to common
sense, to general experience, to enlightened reason and to the manifest
laws of the divine Providence." Sick people needed fortifying, not
draining, said Dr. Turner, and he was squelched.

Medical analogies, applied to social organisms, are apt to be
far-fetched, and there is no point in mistaking mammalian chemistry for
what occurs in a city. But analogies as to what goes on in the brains of
earnest and learned men, dealing with complex phenomena they do not
understand at all and trying to make do with a pseudoscience, do have
point. As in the pseudoscience of bloodletting, just so in the
pseudoscience of city rebuilding and planning, years of learning and a
plethora of subtle and complicated dogma have arisen on a foundation of
nonsense. The tools of technique have steadily been perfected.
Naturally, in time, forceful and able men, admired administrators,
having swallowed the initial fallacies and having been provisioned with
tools and with public confidence, go on logically to the greatest
destructive excesses, which prudence or mercy might previously have
forbade. Bloodletting could heal only by accident or insofar as it broke
the rules, until the time when it was abandoned in favor of the hard,
complex business of assembling, using and testing, bit by bit, true
descriptions of reality drawn not from how it ought to be, but from how
it is. The pseudoscience of city planning and its companion, the art of
city design, have not yet broken with the specious comfort of wishes,
familiar superstitions, oversimplifications, and symbols, and have not
yet embarked upon the adventure of probing the real world.

So in this book we shall start, if only in a small way, adventuring in
the real world, ourselves. The way to get at what goes on in the
seemingly mysterious and perverse behavior of cities is, I think, to
look closely, and with as little previous expectation as is possible, at
the most ordinary scenes and events, and attempt to see what they mean
and whether any threads of principle emerge among them. This is what I
try to do in the first part of this book.

[]{#calibre_link-329 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="14"}One principle
emerges so ubiquitously, and in so many and such complex different
forms, that I turn my attention to its nature in the second part of this
book, a part which becomes the heart of my argument. This ubiquitous
principle is the need of cities for a most intricate and close-grained
diversity of uses that give each other constant mutual support, both
economically and socially. The components of this diversity can differ
enormously, but they must supplement each other in certain concrete
ways.

I think that unsuccessful city areas are areas which lack this kind of
intricate mutual support, and that the science of city planning and the
art of city design, in real life for real cities, must become the
science and art of catalyzing and nourishing these close-grained working
relationships. I think, from the evidence I can find, that there are
four primary conditions required for generating useful great city
diversity, and that by deliberately inducing these four conditions,
planning can induce city vitality (something that the plans of planners
alone, and the designs of designers alone, can never achieve). While
[Part I](#calibre_link-10){.calibre7} is principally about the social
behavior of people in cities, and is necessary for understanding what
follows, [Part II](#calibre_link-16){.calibre7} is principally about the
economic behavior of cities and is the most important part of this book.

Cities are fantastically dynamic places, and this is strikingly true of
their successful parts, which offer a fertile ground for the plans of
thousands of people. In the third part of this book, I examine some
aspects of decay and regeneration, in the light of how cities are used,
and how they and their people behave, in real life.

The last part of the book suggests changes in housing, traffic, design,
planning and administrative practices, and discusses, finally, the
*kind* of problem which cities pose---a problem in handling organized
complexity.

The look of things and the way they work are inextricably bound
together, and in no place more so than cities. But people who are
interested only in how a city "ought" to look and uninterested in how it
works will be disappointed by this book. It is futile to plan a city's
appearance, or speculate on how to endow it with a pleasing appearance
of order, without knowing what sort of innate, functioning order it has.
To seek for the look of things []{#calibre_link-334 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="15"}as a primary purpose or as the main drama is
apt to make nothing but trouble.

In New York's East Harlem there is a housing project with a conspicuous
rectangular lawn which became an object of hatred to the project
tenants. A social worker frequently at the project was astonished by how
often the subject of the lawn came up, usually gratuitously as far as
she could see, and how much the tenants despised it and urged that it be
done away with. When she asked why, the usual answer was, "What good is
it?" or "Who wants it?" Finally one day a tenant more articulate than
the others made this pronouncement: "Nobody cared what we wanted when
they built this place. They threw our houses down and pushed us here and
pushed our friends somewhere else. We don't have a place around here to
get a cup of coffee or a newspaper even, or borrow fifty cents. Nobody
cared what we need. But the big men come and look at that grass and say,
'Isn't it wonderful! Now the poor have everything!' "

This tenant was saying what moralists have said for thousands of years:
Handsome is as handsome does. All that glitters is not gold.

She was saying more: There is a quality even meaner than outright
ugliness or disorder, and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of
pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that
is struggling to exist and to be served.

In trying to explain the underlying order of cities, I use a
preponderance of examples from New York because that is where I live.
But most of the basic ideas in this book come from things I first
noticed or was told in other cities. For example, my first inkling about
the powerful effects of certain kinds of functional mixtures in the city
came from Pittsburgh, my first speculations about street safety from
Philadelphia and Baltimore, my first notions about the meanderings of
downtown from Boston, my first clues to the unmaking of slums from
Chicago. Most of the material for these musings was at my own front
door, but perhaps it is easiest to see things first where you don't take
them for granted. The basic idea, to try to begin understanding the
intricate social and economic order under the seeming disorder of
cities, was not my []{#calibre_link-339 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="16"}idea at all, but that of William Kirk, head worker of Union
Settlement in East Harlem, New York, who, by showing me East Harlem,
showed me a way of seeing other neighborhoods, and downtowns too. In
every case, I have tried to test out what I saw or heard in one city or
neighborhood against others, to find how relevant each city's or each
place's lessons might be outside its own special case.

I have concentrated on great cities, and on their inner areas, because
this is the problem that has been most consistently evaded in planning
theory. I think this may also have somewhat wider usefulness as time
passes, because many of the parts of today's cities in the worst, and
apparently most baffling, trouble were suburbs or dignified, quiet
residential areas not too long ago; eventually many of today's brand-new
suburbs or semisuburbs are going to be engulfed in cities and will
succeed or fail in that condition depending on whether they can adapt to
functioning successfully as city districts. Also, to be frank, I like
dense cities best and care about them most.

But I hope no reader will try to transfer my observations into guides as
to what goes on in towns, or little cities, or in suburbs which still
are suburban. Towns, suburbs and even little cities are totally
different organisms from great cities. We are in enough trouble already
from trying to understand big cities in terms of the behavior, and the
imagined behavior, of towns. To try to understand towns in terms of big
cities will only compound confusion.

I hope any reader of this book will constantly and skeptically test what
I say against his own knowledge of cities and their behavior. If I have
been inaccurate in observations or mistaken in inferences and
conclusions, I hope these faults will be quickly corrected. The point
is, we need desperately to learn and to apply as much knowledge that is
true and useful about cities as fast as possible.

I have been making unkind remarks about orthodox city planning theory,
and shall make more as occasion arises to do so. By now, these orthodox
ideas are part of our folklore. They harm us because we take them for
granted. To show how we got them, []{#calibre_link-345 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="17"}and how little they are to the point, I
shall give a quick outline here of the most influential ideas that have
contributed to the verities of orthodox modern city planning and city
architectural design.

The most important thread of influence starts, more or less, with
Ebenezer Howard, an English court reporter for whom planning was an
avocation. Howard looked at the living conditions of the poor in
late-nineteenth-century London, and justifiably did not like what he
smelled or saw or heard. He not only hated the wrongs and mistakes of
the city, he hated the city and thought it an outright evil and an
affront to nature that so many people should get themselves into an
agglomeration. His prescription for saving the people was to do the city
in.

The program he proposed, in 1898, was to halt the growth of London and
also repopulate the countryside, where villages were declining, by
building a new kind of town---the Garden City, where the city poor might
again live close to nature.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-36){#calibre_link-38
.calibre7} So they might earn their livings, industry was to be set up
in the Garden City, for while Howard was not planning cities, he was not
planning dormitory suburbs either. His aim was the creation of
self-sufficient small towns, really very nice towns if you were docile
and had no plans of your own and did not mind spending your life among
others with no plans of their own. As in all Utopias, the right to have
plans of any significance belonged only to the planners in charge. The
Garden City was to be encircled with a belt of agriculture. Industry was
to be in its planned preserves; schools, housing and greens in planned
living preserves; and in the center were to be commercial, club and
cultural places, held in []{#calibre_link-348 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="18"}common. The town and green belt, in their totality, were to
be permanently controlled by the public authority under which the town
was developed, to prevent speculation or supposedly irrational changes
in land use and also to do away with temptations to increase its
density---in brief, to prevent it from ever becoming a city. The maximum
population was to be held to thirty thousand people.

Nathan Glazer has summed up the vision well in *Architectural Forum*:
"The image was the English country town---with the manor house and its
park replaced by a community center, and with some factories hidden
behind a screen of trees, to supply work."

The closest American equivalent would probably be the model company
town, with profit-sharing, and with the Parent-Teacher Associations in
charge of the routine, custodial political life. For Howard was
envisioning not simply a new physical environment and social life, but a
paternalistic political and economic society.

Nevertheless, as Glazer has pointed out, the Garden City was "conceived
as an alternative to the city, and as a solution to city problems; this
was, and is still, the foundation of its immense power as a planning
idea." Howard managed to get two garden cities built, Letchworth and
Welwyn, and of course England and Sweden have, since the Second World
War, built a number of satellite towns based on Garden City principles.
In the United States, the suburb of Radburn, N.J., and the
depression-built, government-sponsored Green Belt towns (actually
suburbs) were all incomplete modifications on the idea. But Howard's
influence in the literal, or reasonably literal, acceptance of his
program was as nothing compared to his influence on conceptions
underlying all American city planning today. City planners and designers
with no interest in the Garden City, as such, are still thoroughly
governed intellectually by its underlying principles.

Howard set spinning powerful and city-destroying ideas: He conceived
that the way to deal with the city's functions was to sort and sift out
of the whole certain simple uses, and to arrange each of these in
relative self-containment. He focused on the provision of wholesome
housing as the central problem, to which everything else was subsidiary;
furthermore he defined wholesome []{#calibre_link-353 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="19"}housing in terms only of suburban physical
qualities and small-town social qualities. He conceived of commerce in
terms of routine, standardized supply of goods, and as serving a
self-limited market. He conceived of good planning as a series of static
acts; in each case the plan must anticipate all that is needed and be
protected, after it is built, against any but the most minor subsequent
changes. He conceived of planning also as essentially paternalistic, if
not authoritarian. He was uninterested in the aspects of the city which
could not be abstracted to serve his Utopia. In particular, he simply
wrote off the intricate, many-faceted, cultural life of the metropolis.
He was uninterested in such problems as the way great cities police
themselves, or exchange ideas, or operate politically, or invent new
economic arrangements, and he was oblivious to devising ways to
strengthen these functions because, after all, he was not designing for
this kind of life in any case.

Both in his preoccupations and in his omissions, Howard made sense in
his own terms but none in terms of city planning. Yet virtually all
modern city planning has been adapted from, and embroidered on, this
silly substance.

Howard's influence on American city planning converged on the city from
two directions: from town and regional planners on the one hand, and
from architects on the other. Along the avenue of planning, Sir Patrick
Geddes, a Scots biologist and philosopher, saw the Garden City idea not
as a fortuitous way to absorb population growth otherwise destined for a
great city, but as the starting point of a much grander and more
encompassing pattern. He thought of the planning of cities in terms of
the planning of whole regions. Under regional planning, garden cities
would be rationally distributed throughout large territories,
dovetailing into natural resources, balanced against agriculture and
woodland, forming one far-flung logical whole.

Howard's and Geddes' ideas were enthusiastically adopted in America
during the 1920's, and developed further by a group of extraordinarily
effective and dedicated people---among them Lewis Mumford, Clarence
Stein, the late Henry Wright, and Catherine Bauer. While they thought of
themselves as regional planners, Catherine Bauer has more recently
called this group the []{#calibre_link-357 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="20"}"Decentrists," and this name is more apt, for the primary
result of regional planning, as they saw it, would be to decentralize
great cities, thin them out, and disperse their enterprises and
populations into smaller, separated cities or, better yet, towns. At the
time, it appeared that the American population was both aging and
leveling off in numbers, and the problem appeared to be not one of
accommodating a rapidly growing population, but simply of redistributing
a static population.

As with Howard himself, this group's influence was less in getting
literal acceptance of its program---that got nowhere---than in
influencing city planning and legislation affecting housing and housing
finance. Model housing schemes by Stein and Wright, built mainly in
suburban settings or at the fringes of cities, together with the
writings and the diagrams, sketches and photographs presented by Mumford
and Bauer, demonstrated and popularized ideas such as these, which are
now taken for granted in orthodox planning: The street is bad as an
environment for humans; houses should be turned away from it and faced
inward, toward sheltered greens. Frequent streets are wasteful, of
advantage only to real estate speculators who measure value by the front
foot. The basic unit of city design is not the street, but the block and
more particularly the super-block. Commerce should be segregated from
residences and greens. A neighborhood's demand for goods should be
calculated "scientifically," and this much and no more commercial space
allocated. The presence of many other people is, at best, a necessary
evil, and good city planning must aim for at least an illusion of
isolation and suburbany privacy. The Decentrists also pounded in
Howard's premises that the planned community must be islanded off as a
self-contained unit, that it must resist future change, and that every
significant detail must be controlled by the planners from the start and
then stuck to. In short, good planning was project planning.

To reinforce and dramatize the necessity for the new order of things,
the Decentrists hammered away at the bad old city. They were incurious
about successes in great cities. They were interested only in failures.
All was failure. A book like Mumford's *The Culture of Cities* was
largely a morbid and biased catalog of ills. The great city was
Megalopolis, Tyrannopolis, Nekropolis, []{#calibre_link-360 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="21"}a monstrosity, a tyranny, a living death. It
must go. New York's midtown was "solidified chaos" (Mumford). The shape
and appearance of cities was nothing but "a chaotic accident...the
summation of the haphazard, antagonistic whims of many self-centered,
ill-advised individuals" (Stein). The centers of cities amounted to "a
foreground of noise, dirt, beggars, souvenirs and shrill competitive
advertising" (Bauer).

How could anything so bad be worth the attempt to understand it? The
Decentrists' analyses, the architectural and housing designs which were
companions and offshoots of these analyses, the national housing and
home financing legislation so directly influenced by the new
vision---none of these had anything to do with understanding cities, or
fostering successful large cities, nor were they intended to. They were
reasons and means for jettisoning cities, and the Decentrists were frank
about this.

But in the schools of planning and architecture, and in Congress, state
legislatures and city halls too, the Decentrists' ideas were gradually
accepted as basic guides for dealing constructively with big cities
themselves. This is the most amazing event in the whole sorry tale: that
finally people who sincerely wanted to strengthen great cities should
adopt recipes frankly devised for undermining their economies and
killing them.

The man with the most dramatic idea of how to get all this anti-city
planning right into the citadels of iniquity themselves was the European
architect Le Corbusier. He devised in the 1920's a dream city which he
called the Radiant City, composed not of the low buildings beloved of
the Decentrists, but instead mainly of skyscrapers within a park.
"Suppose we are entering the city by way of the Great Park," Le
Corbusier wrote. "Our fast car takes the special elevated motor track
between the majestic skyscrapers: as we approach nearer, there is seen
the repetition against the sky of the twenty-four skyscrapers; to our
left and right on the outskirts of each particular area are the
municipal and administrative buildings; and enclosing the space are the
museums and university buildings. The whole city is a Park." In Le
Corbusier's vertical city the common run of mankind was to be housed at
1,200 inhabitants to the acre, a fantastically high city density indeed,
but because of building up so high, 95 percent []{#calibre_link-364
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="22"}of the ground could remain open.
The skyscrapers would occupy only 5 percent of the ground. The
high-income people would be in lower, luxury housing around courts, with
85 percent of their ground left open. Here and there would be
restaurants and theaters.

Le Corbusier was planning not only a physical environment. He was
planning for a social Utopia too. Le Corbusier's Utopia was a condition
of what he called maximum individual liberty, by which he seems to have
meant not liberty to do anything much, but liberty from ordinary
responsibility. In his Radiant City nobody, presumably, was going to
have to be his brother's keeper any more. Nobody was going to have to
struggle with plans of his own. Nobody was going to be tied down.

The Decentrists and other loyal advocates of the Garden City were aghast
at Le Corbusier's city of towers in the park, and still are. Their
reaction to it was, and remains, much like that of progressive nursery
school teachers confronting an utterly institutional orphanage. And yet,
ironically, the Radiant City comes directly out of the Garden City. Le
Corbusier accepted the Garden City's fundamental image, superficially at
least, and worked to make it practical for high densities. He described
his creation as the Garden City made attainable. "The garden city is a
will-o'-the-wisp," he wrote. "Nature melts under the invasion of roads
and houses and the promised seclusion becomes a crowded settlement...The
solution will be found in the Vertical garden city.' "

In another sense too, in its relatively easy public reception, Le
Corbusier's Radiant City depended upon the Garden City. The Garden City
planners and their ever increasing following among housing reformers,
students and architects were indefatigably popularizing the ideas of the
super-block, the project neighborhood, the unchangeable plan, and grass,
grass, grass; what is more they were successfully establishing such
attributes as the hallmarks of humane, socially responsible, functional,
high-minded planning. Le Corbusier really did not have to justify his
vision in either humane or city-functional terms. If the great object of
city planning was that Christopher Robin might go hoppety-hoppety on the
grass, what was wrong with Le Corbusier? The Decentrists'
[]{#calibre_link-368 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="23"}cries of
insti­tutio­naliz­ation, mechanization, depersonalization seemed to others
foolishly sectarian.

Le Corbusier's dream city has had an immense impact on our cities. It
was hailed deliriously by architects, and has gradually been embodied in
scores of projects, ranging from low-income public housing to office
building projects. Aside from making at least the superficial Garden
City principles superficially practicable in dense city, Le Corbusier's
dream contained other marvels. He attempted to make planning for the
automobile an integral part of his scheme, and this was, in the 1920's
and early 1930's, a new, exciting idea. He included great arterial roads
for express one-way traffic. He cut the number of streets because
"cross-roads are an enemy to traffic." He proposed underground streets
for heavy vehicles and deliveries, and of course like the Garden City
planners he kept the pedestrians off the streets and in the parks. His
city was like a wonderful mechanical toy. Furthermore, his conception,
as an architectural work, had a dazzling clarity, simplicity and
harmony. It was so orderly, so visible, so easy to understand. It said
everything in a flash, like a good advertisement. This vision and its
bold symbolism have been all but irresistible to planners, housers,
designers, and to developers, lenders and mayors too. It exerts a great
pull on "progressive" zoners, who write rules calculated to encourage
nonproject builders to reflect, if only a little, the dream. No matter
how vulgarized or clumsy the design, how dreary and useless the open
space, how dull the close-up view, an imitation of Le Corbusier shouts
"Look what I made!" Like a great, visible ego it tells of someone's
achievement. But as to how the city works, it tells, like the Garden
City, nothing but lies.

Although the Decentrists, with their devotion to the ideal of a cozy
town life, have never made peace with the Le Corbusier vision, most of
their disciples have. Virtually all sophisticated city designers today
combine the two conceptions in various permutations. The rebuilding
technique variously known as "selective removal" or "spot renewal" or
"renewal planning" or "planned conservation"---meaning that total
clearance of a run-down area is avoided---is largely the trick of seeing
how many old buildings can be left standing and the area still converted
into a passable []{#calibre_link-371 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="24"}version of Radiant Garden City. Zoners, highway planners,
legislators, land-use planners, and parks and playground planners---none
of whom live in an ideological vacuum---constantly use, as fixed points
of reference, these two powerful visions and the more sophisticated
merged vision. They may wander from the visions, they may compromise,
they may vulgarize, but these are the points of departure.

We shall look briefly at one other, less important, line of ancestry in
orthodox planning. This one begins more or less with the great Columbian
Exposition in Chicago in 1893, just about the same time that Howard was
formulating his Garden City ideas. The Chicago fair snubbed the exciting
modern architecture which had begun to emerge in Chicago and instead
dramatized a retrogressive imitation Renaissance style. One heavy,
grandiose monument after another was arrayed in the exposition park,
like frosted pastries on a tray, in a sort of squat, decorated forecast
of Le Corbusier's later repetitive ranks of towers in a park. This
orgiastic assemblage of the rich and monumental captured the imagination
of both planners and public. It gave impetus to a movement called the
City Beautiful, and indeed the planning of the exposition was dominated
by the man who became the leading City Beautiful planner, Daniel Burnham
of Chicago.

The aim of the City Beautiful was the City Monumental. Great schemes
were drawn up for systems of baroque boulevards, which mainly came to
nothing. What did come out of the movement was the Center Monumental,
modeled on the fair. City after city built its civic center or its
cultural center. These buildings were arranged along a boulevard as at
Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, or along a mall like the
Government Center in Cleveland, or were bordered by park, like the Civic
Center at St. Louis, or were interspersed with park, like the Civic
Center at San Francisco. However they were arranged, the important point
was that the monuments had been sorted out from the rest of the city,
and assembled into the grandest effect thought possible, the whole being
treated as a complete unit, in a separate and well-defined way.

People were proud of them, but the centers were not a success. For one
thing, invariably the ordinary city around them ran []{#calibre_link-375
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="25"}down instead of being uplifted,
and they always acquired an incongruous rim of ratty tattoo parlors and
second-hand-clothing stores, or else just nondescript, dispirited decay.
For another, people stayed away from them to a remarkable degree.
Somehow, when the fair became part of the city, it did not work like the
fair.

The architecture of the City Beautiful centers went out of style. But
the idea behind the centers was not questioned, and it has never had
more force than it does today. The idea of sorting out certain cultural
or public functions and decontaminating their relationship with the
workaday city dovetailed nicely with the Garden City teachings. The
conceptions have harmoniously merged, much as the Garden City and the
Radiant City merged, into a sort of Radiant Garden City Beautiful, such
as the immense Lincoln Square project for New York, in which a
monumental City Beautiful cultural center is one among a series of
adjoining Radiant City and Radiant Garden City housing, shopping and
campus centers.

And by analogy, the principles of sorting out---and of bringing order by
repression of all plans but the planners'---have been easily extended to
all manner of city functions, until today a land-use master plan for a
big city is largely a matter of proposed placement, often in relation to
transportation, of many series of decontaminated sortings.

From beginning to end, from Howard and Burnham to the latest amendment
on urban-renewal law, the entire concoction is irrelevant to the
workings of cities. Unstudied, unrespected, cities have served as
sacrificial victims.

# The uses of sidewalks: safety {#calibre_link-391 .chaphead1}
:::

Streets in cities serve many purposes besides carrying vehicles, and
city sidewalks---the pedestrian parts of the streets---serve many
purposes besides carrying pedestrians. These uses are bound up with
circulation but are not identical with it and in their own right they
are at least as basic as circulation to the proper workings of cities.

A city sidewalk by itself is nothing. It is an abstraction. It means
something only in conjunction with the buildings and other uses that
border it, or border other sidewalks very near it. The same might be
said of streets, in the sense that they serve other purposes besides
carrying wheeled traffic in their middles. Streets and their sidewalks,
the main public places of a city, are its most vital organs. Think of a
city and what comes to mind? Its streets. If a city's streets look
interesting, the city looks interesting; if they look dull, the city
looks dull.

More than that, and here we get down to the first problem, if a
[]{#calibre_link-395 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="30"}city's
streets are safe from barbarism and fear, the city is thereby tolerably
safe from barbarism and fear. When people say that a city, or a part of
it, is dangerous or is a jungle what they mean primarily is that they do
not feel safe on the sidewalks.

But sidewalks and those who use them are not passive beneficiaries of
safety or helpless victims of danger. Sidewalks, their bordering uses,
and their users, are active participants in the drama of civilization
versus barbarism in cities. To keep the city safe is a fundamental task
of a city's streets and its sidewalks.

This task is totally unlike any service that sidewalks and streets in
little towns or true suburbs are called upon to do. Great cities are not
like towns, only larger. They are not like suburbs, only denser. They
differ from towns and suburbs in basic ways, and one of these is that
cities are, by definition, full of strangers. To any one person,
strangers are far more common in big cities than acquaintances. More
common not just in places of public assembly, but more common at a man's
own doorstep. Even residents who live near each other are strangers, and
must be, because of the sheer number of people in small geographical
compass.

The bedrock attribute of a successful city district is that a person
must feel personally safe and secure on the street among all these
strangers. He must not feel automatically menaced by them. A city
district that fails in this respect also does badly in other ways and
lays up for itself, and for its city at large, mountain on mountain of
trouble.

Today barbarism has taken over many city streets, or people fear it has,
which comes to much the same thing in the end. "I live in a lovely,
quiet residential area," says a friend of mine who is hunting another
place to live. "The only disturbing sound at night is the occasional
scream of someone being mugged." It does not take many incidents of
violence on a city street, or in a city district, to make people fear
the streets. And as they fear them, they use them less, which makes the
streets still more unsafe.

To be sure, there are people with hobgoblins in their heads, and such
people will never feel safe no matter what the objective circumstances
are. But this is a different matter from the fear that besets normally
prudent, tolerant and cheerful people who show nothing more than common
sense in refusing to venture after []{#calibre_link-401 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="31"}dark---or in a few places, by day---into
streets where they may well be assaulted, unseen or unrescued until too
late.

The barbarism and the real, not imagined, insecurity that gives rise to
such fears cannot be tagged a problem of the slums. The problem is most
serious, in fact, in genteel-looking "quiet residential areas" like that
my friend was leaving.

It cannot be tagged as a problem of older parts of cities. The problem
reaches its most baffling dimensions in some examples of rebuilt parts
of cities, including supposedly the best examples of rebuilding, such as
middle-income projects. The police precinct captain of a nationally
admired project of this kind (admired by planners and lenders) has
recently admonished residents not only about hanging around outdoors
after dark but has urged them never to answer their doors without
knowing the caller. Life here has much in common with life for the three
little pigs or the seven little kids of the nursery thrillers. The
problem of sidewalk and doorstep insecurity is as serious in cities
which have made conscientious efforts at rebuilding as it is in those
cities that have lagged. Nor is it illuminating to tag minority groups,
or the poor, or the outcast with responsibility for city danger. There
are immense variations in the degree of civilization and safety found
among such groups and among the city areas where they live. Some of the
safest sidewalks in New York City, for example, at any time of day or
night, are those along which poor people or minority groups live. And
some of the most dangerous are in streets occupied by the same kinds of
people. All this can also be said of other cities.

Deep and complicated social ills must lie behind delinquency and crime,
in suburbs and towns as well as in great cities. This book will not go
into speculation on the deeper reasons. It is sufficient, at this point,
to say that if we are to maintain a city society that can diagnose and
keep abreast of deeper social problems, the starting point must be, in
any case, to strengthen whatever workable forces for maintaining safety
and civilization do exist---in the cities we do have. To build city
districts that are custom made for easy crime is idiotic. Yet that is
what we do.

The first thing to understand is that the public peace---the sidewalk
and street peace---of cities is not kept primarily by the
[]{#calibre_link-406 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="32"}police,
necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost
unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the
people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves. In some city
areas---older public housing projects and streets with very high
population turnover are often conspicuous examples---the keeping of
public sidewalk law and order is left almost entirely to the police and
special guards. Such places are jungles. No amount of police can enforce
civilization where the normal, casual enforcement of it has broken down.

The second thing to understand is that the problem of insecurity cannot
be solved by spreading people out more thinly, trading the
characteristics of cities for the characteristics of suburbs. If this
could solve danger on the city streets, then Los Angeles should be a
safe city because superficially Los Angeles is almost all suburban. It
has virtually no districts compact enough to qualify as dense city
areas. Yet Los Angeles cannot, any more than any other great city, evade
the truth that, being a city, it *is* composed of strangers not all of
whom are nice. Los Angeles' crime figures are flabbergasting. Among the
seventeen standard metropolitan areas with populations over a million,
Los Angeles stands so pre-eminent in crime that it is in a category by
itself. And this is markedly true of crimes associated with personal
attack, the crimes that make people fear the streets.

Los Angeles, for example, has a forcible rape rate (1958 figures) of
31.9 per 100,000 population, more than twice as high as either of the
next two cities, which happen to be St. Louis and Philadelphia; three
times as high as the rate of 10.1 for Chicago, and more than four times
as high as the rate of 7.4 for New York.

In aggravated assault, Los Angeles has a rate of 185, compared with
149.5 for Baltimore and 139.2 for St. Louis (the two next highest), and
with 90.9 for New York and 79 for Chicago.

The overall Los Angeles rate for major crimes is 2,507.6 per 100,000
people, far ahead of St. Louis and Houston, which come next with 1,634.5
and 1,541.1, and of New York and Chicago, which have rates of 1,145.3
and 943.5.

The reasons for Los Angeles' high crime rates are undoubtedly complex,
and at least in part obscure. But of this we can be sure: thinning out a
city does not insure safety from crime and []{#calibre_link-412
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="33"}fear of crime. This is one of the
conclusions that can be drawn within individual cities too, where
pseudosuburbs or superannuated suburbs are ideally suited to rape,
muggings, beatings, holdups and the like.

Here we come up against an all-important question about any city street:
How much easy opportunity does it offer to crime? It may be that there
is some absolute amount of crime in a given city, which will find an
outlet somehow (I do not believe this). Whether this is so or not,
different kinds of city streets garner radically different shares of
barbarism and fear of barbarism.

Some city streets afford no opportunity to street barbarism. The streets
of the North End of Boston are outstanding examples. They are probably
as safe as any place on earth in this respect. Although most of the
North End's residents are Italian or of Italian descent, the district's
streets are also heavily and constantly used by people of every race and
background. Some of the strangers from outside work in or close to the
district; some come to shop and stroll; many, including members of
minority groups who have inherited dangerous districts previously
abandoned by others, make a point of cashing their paychecks in North
End stores and immediately making their big weekly purchases in streets
where they know they will not be parted from their money between the
getting and the spending.

Frank Havey, director of the North End Union, the local settlement
house, says, "I have been here in the North End twenty-eight years, and
in all that time I have never heard of a single case of rape, mugging,
molestation of a child or other street crime of that sort in the
district. And if there had been any, I would have heard of it even if it
did not reach the papers." Half a dozen times or so in the past three
decades, says Havey, would-be molesters have made an attempt at luring a
child or, late at night, attacking a woman. In every such case the try
was thwarted by passers-by, by kibitzers from windows, or shopkeepers.

Meantime, in the Elm Hill Avenue section of Roxbury, a part of inner
Boston that is suburban in superficial character, street assaults and
the ever present possibility of more street assaults with no kibitzers
to protect the victims, induce prudent people to stay off the sidewalks
at night. Not surprisingly, for this and other []{#calibre_link-417
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="34"}reasons that are related
(dispiritedness and dullness), most of Roxbury has run down. It has
become a place to leave.

I do not wish to single out Roxbury or its once fine Elm Hill Avenue
section especially as a vulnerable area; its disabilities, and
especially its Great Blight of Dullness, are all too common in other
cities too. But differences like these in public safety within the same
city are worth noting. The Elm Hill Avenue section's basic troubles are
not owing to a criminal or a discriminated against or a poverty-stricken
population. Its troubles stem from the fact that it is physically quite
unable to function safely and with related vitality as a city district.

Even within supposedly similar parts of supposedly similar places,
drastic differences in public safety exist. An incident at Washington
Houses, a public housing project in New York, illustrates this point. A
tenants' group at this project, struggling to establish itself, held
some outdoor ceremonies in mid-December 1958, and put up three Christmas
trees. The chief tree, so cumbersome it was a problem to transport,
erect, and trim, went into the project's inner "street," a landscaped
central mall and promenade. The other two trees, each less than six feet
tall and easy to carry, went on two small fringe plots at the outer
corners of the project where it abuts a busy avenue and lively cross
streets of the old city. The first night, the large tree and all its
trimmings were stolen. The two smaller trees remained intact, lights,
ornaments and all, until they were taken down at New Year's. "The place
where the tree was stolen, which is *theoretically* the most safe and
sheltered place in the project, is the same place that is unsafe for
people too, especially children," says a social worker who had been
helping the tenants' group. "People are no safer in that mall than the
Christmas tree. On the other hand, the place where the other trees were
safe, where the project is just one corner out of four, happens to be
safe for people."

This is something everyone already knows: A well-used city street is apt
to be a safe street. A deserted city street is apt to be unsafe. But how
does this work, really? And what makes a city street well used or
shunned? Why is the sidewalk mall in Washington Houses, which is
supposed to be an attraction, shunned? []{#calibre_link-422 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="35"}Why are the sidewalks of the old city just
to its west not shunned? What about streets that are busy part of the
time and then empty abruptly?

A city street equipped to handle strangers, and to make a safety asset,
in itself, out of the presence of strangers, as the streets of
successful city neighborhoods always do, must have three main qualities:

First, there must be a clear demarcation between what is public space
and what is private space. Public and private spaces cannot ooze into
each other as they do typically in suburban settings or in projects.

Second, there must be eyes upon the street, eyes belonging to those we
might call the natural proprietors of the street. The buildings on a
street equipped to handle strangers and to insure the safety of both
residents and strangers, must be oriented to the street. They cannot
turn their backs or blank sides on it and leave it blind.

And third, the sidewalk must have users on it fairly continuously, both
to add to the number of effective eyes on the street and to induce the
people in buildings along the street to watch the sidewalks in
sufficient numbers. Nobody enjoys sitting on a stoop or looking out a
window at an empty street. Almost nobody does such a thing. Large
numbers of people entertain themselves, off and on, by watching street
activity.

In settlements that are smaller and simpler than big cities, controls on
acceptable public behavior, if not on crime, seem to operate with
greater or lesser success through a web of reputation, gossip, approval,
disapproval and sanctions, all of which are powerful if people know each
other and word travels. But a city's streets, which must control not
only the behavior of the people of the city but also of visitors from
suburbs and towns who want to have a big time away from the gossip and
sanctions at home, have to operate by more direct, straightforward
methods. It is a wonder cities have solved such an inherently difficult
problem at all. And yet in many streets they do it magnificently.

It is futile to try to evade the issue of unsafe city streets by
attempting to make some other features of a locality, say interior
courtyards, or sheltered play spaces, safe instead. By definition
[]{#calibre_link-429 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="36"}again, the
streets of a city must do most of the job of handling strangers for this
is where strangers come and go. The streets must not only defend the
city against predatory strangers, they must protect the many, many
peaceable and well-meaning strangers who use them, insuring their safety
too as they pass through. Moreover, no normal person can spend his life
in some artificial haven, and this includes children. Everyone must use
the streets.

On the surface, we seem to have here some simple aims: To try to secure
streets where the public space is unequivocally public, physically
unmixed with private or with nothing-at-all space, so that the area
needing surveillance has clear and practicable limits; and to see that
these public street spaces have eyes on them as continuously as
possible.

But it is not so simple to achieve these objects, especially the latter.
You can't make people use streets they have no reason to use. You can't
make people watch streets they do not want to watch. Safety on the
streets by surveillance and mutual policing of one another sounds grim,
but in real life it is not grim. The safety of the street works best,
most casually, and with least frequent taint of hostility or suspicion
precisely where people are using and most enjoying the city streets
voluntarily and are least conscious, normally, that they are policing.

The basic requisite for such surveillance is a substantial quantity of
stores and other public places sprinkled along the sidewalks of a
district; enterprises and public places that are used by evening and
night must be among them especially. Stores, bars and restaurants, as
the chief examples, work in several different and complex ways to abet
sidewalk safety.

First, they give people---both residents and strangers---concrete
reasons for using the sidewalks on which these enterprises face.

Second, they draw people along the sidewalks past places which have no
attractions to public use in themselves but which become traveled and
peopled as routes to somewhere else; this influence does not carry very
far geographically, so enterprises must be frequent in a city district
if they are to populate with walkers those other stretches of street
that lack public places along the sidewalk. Moreover, there should be
many different kinds of enterprises, to give people reasons for
crisscrossing paths.

[]{#calibre_link-436 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="37"}Third,
storekeepers and other small businessmen are typically strong proponents
of peace and order themselves; they hate broken windows and holdups;
they hate having customers made nervous about safety. They are great
street watchers and sidewalk guardians if present in sufficient numbers.

Fourth, the activity generated by people on errands, or people aiming
for food or drink, is itself an attraction to still other people.

This last point, that the sight of people attracts still other people,
is something that city planners and city architectural designers seem to
find incomprehensible. They operate on the premise that city people seek
the sight of emptiness, obvious order and quiet. Nothing could be less
true. People's love of watching activity and other people is constantly
evident in cities everywhere. This trait reaches an almost ludicrous
extreme on upper Broadway in New York, where the street is divided by a
narrow central mall, right in the middle of traffic. At the cross-street
intersections of this long north-south mall, benches have been placed
behind big concrete buffers and on any day when the weather is even
barely tolerable these benches are filled with people at block after
block after block, watching the pedestrians who cross the mall in front
of them, watching the traffic, watching the people on the busy
sidewalks, watching each other. Eventually Broadway reaches Columbia
University and Barnard College, one to the right, the other to the left.
Here all is obvious order and quiet, No more stores, no more activity
generated by the stores, almost no more pedestrians crossing---and no
more watchers. The benches are there but they go empty in even the
finest weather. I have tried them and can see why. No place could be
more boring. Even the students of these institutions shun the solitude.
They are doing their outdoor loitering, outdoor homework and general
street watching on the steps overlooking the busiest campus crossing.

It is just so on city streets elsewhere. A lively street always has both
its users and pure watchers. Last year I was on such a street in the
Lower East Side of Manhattan, waiting for a bus. I had not been there
longer than a minute, barely long enough to begin taking in the street's
activity of errand goers, children playing, []{#calibre_link-440
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="38"}and loiterers on the stoops, when
my attention was attracted by a woman who opened a window on the third
floor of a tenement across the street and vigorously yoo-hooed at me.
When I caught on that she wanted my attention and responded, she shouted
down, "The bus doesn't run here on Saturdays!" Then by a combination of
shouts and pantomime she directed me around the corner. This woman was
one of thousands upon thousands of people in New York who casually take
care of the streets. They notice strangers. They observe everything
going on. If they need to take action, whether to direct a stranger
waiting in the wrong place or to call the police, they do so. Action
usually requires, to be sure, a certain self-assurance about the actor's
proprietorship of the street and the support he will get if necessary,
matters which will be gone into later in this book. But even more
fundamental than the action and necessary to the action, is the watching
itself.

Not everyone in cities helps to take care of the streets, and many a
city resident or city worker is unaware of why his neighborhood is safe.
The other day an incident occurred on the street where I live, and it
interested me because of this point.

My block of the street, I must explain, is a small one, but it contains
a remarkable range of buildings, varying from several vintages of
tenements to three- and four-story houses that have been converted into
low-rent flats with stores on the ground floor, or returned to
single-family use like ours. Across the street there used to be mostly
four-story brick tenements with stores below. But twelve years ago
several buildings, from the corner to the middle of the block, were
converted into one building with elevator apartments of small size and
high rents.

The incident that attracted my attention was a suppressed struggle going
on between a man and a little girl of eight or nine years old. The man
seemed to be trying to get the girl to go with him. By turns he Was
directing a cajoling attention to her, and then assuming an air of
nonchalance. The girl was making herself rigid, as children do when they
resist, against the wall of one of the tenements across the street.

As I watched from our second-floor window, making up my mind how to
intervene if it seemed advisable, I saw it was not going to be
necessary. From the butcher shop beneath the tenement
[]{#calibre_link-445 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="39"}had emerged
the woman who, with her husband, runs the shop; she was standing within
earshot of the man, her arms folded and a look of determination on her
face. Joe Cornacchia, who with his sons-in-law keeps the delicatessen,
emerged about the same moment and stood solidly to the other side.
Several heads poked out of the tenement windows above, one was withdrawn
quickly and its owner reappeared a moment later in the doorway behind
the man. Two men from the bar next to the butcher shop came to the
doorway and waited. On my side of the street, I saw that the locksmith,
the fruit man and the laundry proprietor had all come out of their shops
and that the scene was also being surveyed from a number of windows
besides ours. That man did not know it, but he was surrounded. Nobody
was going to allow a little girl to be dragged off, even if nobody knew
who she was.

I am sorry---sorry purely for dramatic purposes---to have to report that
the little girl turned out to be the man's daughter.

Throughout the duration of the little drama, perhaps five minutes in
all, no eyes appeared in the windows of the high-rent, small-apartment
building. It was the only building of which this was true. When we first
moved to our block, I used to anticipate happily that perhaps soon all
the buildings would be rehabilitated like that one. I know better now,
and can only anticipate with gloom and foreboding the recent news that
exactly this transformation is scheduled for the rest of the block
frontage adjoining the high-rent building. The high-rent tenants, most
of whom are so transient we cannot even keep track of their faces, have
not the remotest idea of who takes care of their street, or
how.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-39){#calibre_link-41 .calibre7} A city
neighborhood can absorb and protect a substantial number of these birds
of passage, as our neighborhood does. But if and when the neighborhood
finally *becomes* them, they will gradually find the streets less
secure, they will be vaguely mystified about it, and if things get bad
enough they will drift away to another neighborhood which is
mysteriously safer.

In some rich city neighborhoods, where there is little do-it-yourself
surveillance, such as residential Park Avenue or upper
[]{#calibre_link-449 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="40"}Fifth Avenue
in New York, street watchers are hired. The monotonous sidewalks of
residential Park Avenue, for example, are surprisingly little used;
their putative users are populating, instead, the interesting store-,
bar- and restaurant-filled sidewalks of Lexington Avenue and Madison
Avenue to east and west, and the cross streets leading to these. A
network of doormen and superintendents, of delivery boys and nursemaids,
a form of hired neighborhood, keeps residential Park Avenue supplied
with eyes. At night, with the security of the doormen as a bulwark, dog
walkers safely venture forth and supplement the doormen. But this street
is so blank of built-in eyes, so devoid of concrete reasons for using or
watching it instead of turning the first corner off of it, that if its
rents were to slip below the point where they could support a plentiful
hired neighborhood of doormen and elevator men, it would undoubtedly
become a woefully dangerous street.

Once a street is well equipped to handle strangers, once it has both a
good, effective demarcation between private and public spaces and has a
basic supply of activity and eyes, the more strangers the merrier.

Strangers become an enormous asset on the street on which I live, and
the spurs off it, particularly at night when safety assets are most
needed. We are fortunate enough, on the street, to be gifted not only
with a locally supported bar and another around the corner, but also
with a famous bar that draws continuous troops of strangers from
adjoining neighborhoods and even from out of town. It is famous because
the poet Dylan Thomas used to go there, and mentioned it in his writing.
This bar, indeed, works two distinct shifts. In the morning and early
afternoon it is a social gathering place for the old community of Irish
longshoremen and other craftsmen in the area, as it always was. But
beginning in midafternoon it takes on a different life, more like a
college bull session with beer, combined with a literary cocktail party,
and this continues until the early hours of the morning. On a cold
winter's night, as you pass the White Horse, and the doors open, a solid
wave of conversation and animation surges out and hits you; very
warming. The comings and goings from this bar do much to keep our street
reasonably populated until three in []{#calibre_link-452 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="41"}the morning, and it is a street always safe
to come home to. The only instance I know of a beating in our street
occurred in the dead hours between the closing of the bar and dawn. The
beating was halted by one of our neighbors who saw it from his window
and, unconsciously certain that even at night he was part of a web of
strong street law and order, intervened.

A friend of mine lives on a street uptown where a church youth and
community center, with many night dances and other activities, performs
the same service for his street that the White Horse bar does for ours.
Orthodox planning is much imbued with puritanical and Utopian
conceptions of how people should spend their free time, and in planning,
these moralisms on people's private lives are deeply confused with
concepts about the workings of cities. In maintaining city street
civilization, the White Horse bar and the church-sponsored youth center,
different as they undoubtedly are, perform much the same public street
civilizing service. There is not only room in cities for such
differences and many more in taste, purpose and interest of occupation;
cities also have a need for people with all these differences in taste
and proclivity. The preferences of Utopians, and of other compulsive
managers of other people's leisure, for one kind of legal enterprise
over others is worse than irrelevant for cities. It is harmful. The
greater and more plentiful the range of all legitimate interests (in the
strictly legal sense) that city streets and their enterprises can
satisfy, the better for the streets and for the safety and civilization
of the city.

::: {#calibre_link-454 .section_break}

:::

Bars, and indeed all commerce, have a bad name in many city districts
precisely because they do draw strangers, and the strangers do not work
out as an asset at all.

This sad circumstance is especially true in the dispirited gray belts of
great cities and in once fashionable or at least once solid inner
residential areas gone into decline. Because these neighborhoods are so
dangerous, and the streets typically so dark, it is commonly believed
that their trouble may be insufficient street lighting. Good lighting is
important, but darkness alone does not account for the gray areas' deep,
functional sickness, the Great Blight of Dullness.

[]{#calibre_link-458 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="42"}The value of
bright street lights for dispirited gray areas rises from the
reassurance they offer to some people who need to go out on the
sidewalk, or would like to, but lacking the good light would not do so.
Thus the lights induce these people to contribute their own eyes to the
upkeep of the street. Moreover, as is obvious, good lighting augments
every pair of eyes, makes the eyes count for more because their range is
greater. Each additional pair of eyes, and every increase in their
range, is that much to the good for dull gray areas. But unless eyes are
there, and unless in the brains behind those eyes is the almost
unconscious reassurance of general street support in upholding
civilization, lights can do no good. Horrifying public crimes can, and
do, occur in well-lighted subway stations when no effective eyes are
present. They virtually never occur in darkened theaters where many
people and eyes are present. Street lights can be like that famous stone
that falls in the desert where there are no ears to hear. Does it make a
noise? Without effective eyes to see, does a light cast light? Not for
practical purposes.

To explain the troubling effect of strangers on the streets of city gray
areas, I shall first point out, for purposes of analogy, the
peculiarities of another and figurative kind of street---the corridors
of high-rise public housing projects, those derivatives of Radiant City.
The elevators and corridors of these projects are, in a sense, streets.
They are streets piled up in the sky in order to eliminate streets on
the ground and permit the ground to become deserted parks like the mall
at Washington Houses where the tree was stolen.

Not only are these interior parts of the buildings streets in the sense
that they serve the comings and goings of residents, most of whom may
not know each other or recognize, necessarily, who is a resident and who
is not. They are streets also in the sense of being accessible to the
public. They have been designed in an *imitation* of upper-class
standards for apartment living without upper-class cash for doormen and
elevator men. Anyone at all can go into these buildings, unquestioned,
and use the traveling street of the elevator and the sidewalks that are
the corridors. These interior streets, although completely accessible to
public []{#calibre_link-461 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="43"}use,
are closed to public view and they thus lack the checks and inhibitions
exerted by eye-policed city streets.

Troubled, so far as I can determine, less by the amply proved dangers to
human beings in these blind-eyed streets than by the vandalism to
property that occurs in them, the New York City Housing Authority some
years back experimented with corridors open to public view in a Brooklyn
project which I shall call Blenheim Houses although that is not its
name. (I do not wish to add to its troubles by advertising it.)

Because the buildings of Blenheim Houses are sixteen stories high, and
because their height permits generous expanses of shunned ground area,
surveillance of the open corridors from the ground or from other
buildings offers little more than psychological effect, but this
psychological openness to view does appear effective to some degree.
More important and effective, the corridors were well designed to induce
surveillance from within the buildings themselves. Uses other than plain
circulation were built into them. They were equipped as play space, and
made sufficiently generous to act as narrow porches, as well as
passageways. This all turned out to be so lively and interesting that
the tenants added still another use and much the favorite: picnic
grounds---this in spite of continual pleas and threats from the
management which did not *plan* that the balcony-corridors should serve
as picnic grounds. (The plan should anticipate everything and then
permit no changes.) The tenants are devoted to the balcony-corridors;
and as a result of being intensively used the balconies are under
intense surveillance. There has been no problem of crime in these
particular corridors, nor of vandalism either. Not even light bulbs are
stolen or broken, although in projects of similar size with blind-eyed
corridors, light bulb replacements solely because of theft or vandalism
customarily run into the thousands each month.

So far so good.

A striking demonstration of the direct connection between city
surveillance and city safety!

Nonetheless, Blenheim Houses has a fearsome problem of vandalism and
scandalous behavior. The lighted balconies which are,
[]{#calibre_link-467 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="44"}as the
manager puts it, "the brightest and most attractive scene in sight,"
draw strangers, especially teen-agers, from all over Brooklyn. But these
strangers, lured by the magnet of the publicly visible corridors, do not
halt at the visible corridors. They go into other "streets" of the
buildings, streets that lack surveillance. These include the elevators
and, more important in this case, the fire stairs and their landings.
The housing police run up and down after the malefactors---who behave
barbarously and viciously in the blind-eyed, sixteen-story-high
stairways---and the malefactors elude them. It is easy to run the
elevators up to a high floor, jam the doors so the elevators cannot be
brought down, and then play hell with a building and anyone you can
catch. So serious is the problem and apparently so uncontrollable, that
the advantage of the safe corridors is all but canceled---at least in
the harried manager's eyes.

What happens at Blenheim Houses is somewhat the same as what happens in
dull gray areas of cities. The gray areas' pitifully few and thinly
spaced patches of brightness and life are like the visible corridors at
Blenheim Houses. They do attract strangers. But the relatively deserted,
dull, blind streets leading from these places are like the fire stairs
at Blenheim Houses. These are not equipped to handle strangers and the
presence of strangers in them is an automatic menace.

The temptation in such cases is to blame the balconies---or the commerce
or bars that serve as a magnet. A typical train of thought is
exemplified in the Hyde Park-Kenwood renewal project now under way in
Chicago. This piece of gray area adjoining the University of Chicago
contains many splendid houses and grounds, but for thirty years it has
been plagued with a frightening street crime problem, accompanied in
latter years by considerable physical decay. The "cause" of Hyde
Park-Kenwood's decline has been brilliantly identified, by the planning
heirs of the bloodletting doctors, as the presence of "blight." By
blight they mean that too many of the college professors and other
middle-class families steadily deserted this dull and dangerous area and
their places were often, quite naturally, taken by those with little
economic or social choice among living places. The plan designates and
removes these chunks of blight and replaces them with
[]{#calibre_link-470 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="45"}chunks of
Radiant Garden City designed, as usual, to minimize use of the streets.
The plan also adds still more empty spaces here and there, blurs even
further the district's already poor distinctions between private and
public space, and amputates the existing commerce, which is no great
shakes. The early plans for this renewal included a relatively large
imitation-suburban shopping center. But the thoughts of this brought a
faint reminder of realities and a glimmer of apprehension in the course
of the planning process. A large center, larger than that required for
the standard shopping needs of residents in the renewal district itself,
"might draw into the area extraneous people," as one of the
architectural planners put it. A small shopping center was thereupon
settled on. Large or small matters little.

It matters little because Hyde Park-Kenwood, like all city districts,
is, in real life, surrounded by "extraneous" people. The area is an
embedded part of Chicago. It cannot wish away its location. It cannot
bring back its one-time condition, long gone, of semisuburbia. To plan
as if it could, and to evade its deep, functional inadequacies, can have
only one of two possible results.

Either extraneous people will continue to come into the area as they
please, and if so they will include some strangers who are not at all
nice. So far as security is concerned, nothing will have changed except
that the opportunity for street crime will be a little easier, if
anything, because of the added emptiness. Or the plan can be accompanied
by determined, extraordinary means for keeping extraneous people out of
this area, just as the adjoining University of Chicago, the institution
that was the moving spirit in getting the plan under way, has itself
taken the extraordinary measure, as reported in the press, of loosing
police dogs every night to patrol its campus and hold at bay any human
being in this dangerous unurban inner keep. The barriers formed by new
projects at the edges of Hyde Park-Kenwood, plus extraordinary policing,
may indeed keep out extraneous people with sufficient effectiveness. If
so, the price will be hostility from the surrounding city and an ever
more beleaguered feeling within the fort. And who can be sure, either,
that all those thousands rightfully within the fort are trustworthy in
the dark?

Again, I do not wish to single out one area, or in this case one
[]{#calibre_link-474 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="46"}plan, as
uniquely opprobrious. Hyde Park-Kenwood is significant mainly because
the diagnosis and the corrective measures of the plan are typical---just
slightly more ambitious---of plans conceived for gray area renewal
experiments in cities all over the country. This is City Planning, with
all the stamp of orthodoxy on it, not some aberration of local
willfulness.

Suppose we continue with building, and with deliberate rebuilding, of
unsafe cities. How do we live with this insecurity? From the evidence
thus far, there seem to be three modes of living with it; maybe in time
others will be invented but I suspect these three will simply be further
developed, if that is the word for it.

The first mode is to let danger hold sway, and let those unfortunate
enough to be stuck with it take the consequences. This is the policy now
followed with respect to low-income housing projects, and to many
middle-income housing projects.

The second mode is to take refuge in vehicles. This is a technique
practiced in the big wild-animal reservations of Africa, where tourists
are warned to leave their cars under no circumstances until they reach a
lodge. It is also the technique practiced in Los Angeles. Surprised
visitors to that city are forever recounting how the police of Beverly
Hills stopped them, made them prove their reasons for being afoot, and
warned them of the danger. This technique of public safety does not seem
to work too effectively yet in Los Angeles, as the crime rate shows, but
in time it may. And think what the crime figures might be if more people
without metal shells were helpless upon the vast, blind-eyed reservation
of Los Angeles.

People in dangerous parts of other cities often use automobiles as
protection too, of course, or try to. A letter to the editor in the *New
York Post,* reads, "I live on a dark street off Utica Avenue in Brooklyn
and therefore decided to take a cab home even though it was not late.
The cab driver asked that I get off at the corner of Utica, saying he
did not want to go down the dark street. If I had wanted to walk down
the dark street, who needed him?"

The third mode, at which I have already hinted while discussing
[]{#calibre_link-481 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="47"}Hyde
Park-Kenwood, was developed by hoodlum gangs and has been adopted widely
by developers of the rebuilt city. This mode is to cultivate the
institution of Turf.

Under the Turf system in its historical form, a gang appropriates as its
territory certain streets or housing projects or parks---often a
combination of the three. Members of other gangs cannot enter this Turf
without permission from the Turf-owning gang, or if they do so it is at
peril of being beaten or run off. In 1956, the New York City Youth
Board, fairly desperate because of gang warfare, arranged through its
gang youth workers a series of truces among fighting gangs. The truces
were reported to stipulate, among other provisions, a mutual
understanding of Turf boundaries among the gangs concerned and agreement
not to trespass.

The city's police commissioner, Stephen P. Kennedy, thereupon expressed
outrage at agreements respecting Turf. The police, he said, aimed to
protect the right of every person to walk any part of the city in safety
and with impunity as a basic right. Pacts about Turf, he indicated, were
intolerably subversive both of public rights and public safety.

I think Commissioner Kennedy was profoundly right. However, we must
reflect upon the problem facing the Youth Board workers. It was a real
one, and they were trying as well as they could to meet it with whatever
empirical means they could. The safety of the city, on which public
right and freedom of movement ultimately depend, was missing from the
unsuccessful streets, parks and projects dominated by these gangs.
Freedom of the city, under these circumstances, was a rather academic
ideal.

Now consider the redevelopment projects of cities: the middle- and
upper-income housing occupying many acres of city, many former blocks,
with their own grounds and their own streets to serve these "islands
within the city," "cities within the city," and "new concepts in city
living," as the advertisements for them say. The technique here is also
to designate the Turf and fence the other gangs out. At first the fences
were never visible. Patrolling guards were sufficient to enforce the
line. But in the past few years the fences have become literal.

Perhaps the first was the high cyclone fence around a Radiant
[]{#calibre_link-487 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="48"}Garden City
project adjoining Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore (great educational
institutions seem to be deplorably inventive with Turf devices). In case
anyone mistakes what the fence means, the signs on the project street
also say "Keep Out. No Trespassing." It is uncanny to see a city
neighborhood, in a civilian city, walled off like this. It looks not
only ugly, in a deep sense, but surrealistic. You can imagine how it
sits with the neighbors, in spite of the antidote message on the project
church's bulletin board: "Christ's Love Is The Best Tonic Of All."

New York has been quick to copy the lesson of Baltimore, in its own
fashion. Indeed, at the back of Amalgamated Houses on the Lower East
Side, New York has gone further. At the northern end of the project's
parklike central promenade, an iron-bar gate has been permanently
padlocked and is crowned not with mere metal netting but with a tangle
of barbed wire. And does this defended promenade give out on depraved
old megalopolis? Not at all. Its neighbor is a public playground and
beyond this more project housing for a different income class.

In the rebuilt city it takes a heap of fences to make a balanced
neighborhood. The "juncture" between two differently price-tagged
populations, again in the rebuilt Lower East Side, that between
middle-income cooperative Corlears Hook and low-income Vladeck Houses,
is especially elaborate. Corlears Hook buffers its Turf against its
next-door neighbors with a wide parking lot running the full width of
the super-block juncture, next a spindly hedge and a six-foot-high
cyclone fence, next a completely fenced-in no man's land some thirty
feet wide consisting mainly of dirty blowing papers and deliberately
inaccessible to anything else. Then begins the Vladeck Turf.

Similarly, on the Upper West Side, the rental agent of Park West
Village, "Your Own World in the Heart of New York," on whom I have
foisted myself as a prospective tenant, tells me reassuringly, "Madam,
as soon as the shopping center is completed, the entire grounds will be
fenced in."

"Cyclone fences?"

"That is correct, madam. And eventually"---waving his hand at the city
surrounding his domain---"all that will go. Those people will go. We are
the pioneers here."

[]{#calibre_link-494 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="49"}I suppose it
is rather like pioneer life in a stockaded village, except that the
pioneers were working toward greater security for their civilization,
not less.

Some members of the gangs on the new Turfs find this way of life hard to
take. Such was one who wrote a letter to the *New York Post* in 1959:
"The other day for the first time my pride at being a resident of
Stuyvesant Town and of New York City was replaced by indignation and
shame. I noticed two boys about 12 years old sitting on a Stuyvesant
Town bench. They were deep in conversation, quiet, well-behaved---and
Puerto Rican. Suddenly two Stuyvesant Town guards were approaching---one
from the north and one from the south. The one signaled the other by
pointing to the two boys. One went up to the boys and after several
words, quietly spoken on both sides, the boys rose and left. They tried
to look unconcerned...How can we expect people to have any dignity and
self-respect if we rip it from them even before they reach adulthood?
How really poor are we of Stuyvesant Town and of New York City, too,
that we can't share a bench with two boys."

The Letters Editor gave this communication the headline, "Stay in Your
Own Turf."

But on the whole, people seem to get used very quickly to living in a
Turf with either a figurative or a literal fence, and to wonder how they
got on without it formerly. This phenomenon was described, before the
Turf fences came into the city, by the *New Yorker*, with reference not
to fenced city but to fenced town. It seems that when Oak Ridge,
Tennessee, was demilitarized after the war, the prospect of losing the
fence that went with the militarization drew frightened and impassioned
protests from many residents and occasioned town meetings of high
excitement. Everyone in Oak Ridge had come, not many years before, from
unfenced towns or cities, yet stockade life had become normal and they
feared for their safety without the fence.

Just so, my ten-year-old nephew David, born and brought up in Stuyvesant
Town, "A City Within a City," comments in wonder that anyone at all can
walk on the street outside our door. "Doesn't anybody keep track whether
they pay rent on this []{#calibre_link-499 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="50"}street?" he asks. "Who puts them out if they don't belong
here?"

The technique of dividing the city into Turfs is not simply a New York
solution. It is a Rebuilt American City solution. At the Harvard Design
Conference of 1959, one of the topics pondered by city architectural
designers turned out to be the puzzle of Turf, although they did not use
that designation. The examples discussed happened to be the Lake Meadows
middle-income project of Chicago and the Lafayette Park high-income
project of Detroit. Do you keep the rest of the city out of these
blind-eyed purlieus? How difficult and how unpalatable. Do you invite
the rest of the city in? How difficult and how impossible.

Like the Youth Board workers, the developers and residents of Radiant
City and Radiant Garden City and Radiant Garden City Beautiful have a
genuine difficulty and they have to do the best they can with it by the
empirical means at their disposal. They have little choice. Wherever the
rebuilt city rises the barbaric concept of Turf must follow, because the
rebuilt city has junked a basic function of the city street and with it,
necessarily, the freedom of the city.

::: {#calibre_link-502 .section_break}

:::

Under the seeming disorder of the old city, wherever the old city is
working successfully, is a marvelous order for maintaining the safety of
the streets and the freedom of the city. It is a complex order. Its
essence is intricacy of sidewalk use, bringing with it a constant
succession of eyes. This order is all composed of movement and change,
and although it is life, not art, we may fancifully call it the art form
of the city and liken it to the dance---not to a simple-minded precision
dance with everyone kicking up at the same time, twirling in unison and
bowing off en masse, but to an intricate ballet in which the individual
dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously
reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole. The ballet of the
good city sidewalk never repeats itself from place to place, and in any
one place is always replete with new improvisations.

The stretch of Hudson Street where I live is each day the scene of an
intricate sidewalk ballet. I make my own first entrance into it a little
after eight when I put out the garbage can, surely a prosaic occupation,
but I enjoy my part, my little clang, as the []{#calibre_link-505
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="51"}droves of junior high school
students walk by the center of the stage dropping candy wrappers. (How
do they eat so much candy so early in the morning?)

While I sweep up the wrappers I watch the other rituals of morning: Mr.
Halpert unlocking the laundry's handcart from its mooring to a cellar
door, Joe Cornacchia's son-in-law stacking out the empty crates from the
delicatessen, the barber bringing out his sidewalk folding chair, Mr.
Goldstein arranging the coils of wire which proclaim the hardware store
is open, the wife of the tenement's superintendent depositing her chunky
three-year-old with a toy mandolin on the stoop, the vantage point from
which he is learning the English his mother cannot speak. Now the
primary children, heading for St. Luke's, dribble through to the south;
the children for St. Veronica's cross, heading to the west, and the
children for P.S. 41, heading toward the east. Two new entrances are
being made from the wings: well-dressed and even elegant women and men
with brief cases emerge from doorways and side streets. Most of these
are heading for the bus and subways, but some hover on the curbs,
stopping taxis which have miraculously appeared at the right moment, for
the taxis are part of a wider morning ritual: having dropped passengers
from midtown in the downtown financial district, they are now bringing
downtowners up to midtown. Simultaneously, numbers of women in
housedresses have emerged and as they crisscross with one another they
pause for quick conversations that sound with either laughter or joint
indignation, never, it seems, anything between. It is time for me to
hurry to work too, and I exchange my ritual farewell with Mr. Lofaro,
the short, thick-bodied, white-aproned fruit man who stands outside his
doorway a little up the street, his arms folded, his feet planted,
looking solid as earth itself. We nod; we each glance quickly up and
down the street, then look back to each other and smile. We have done
this many a morning for more than ten years, and we both know what it
means: All is well.

The heart-of-the-day ballet I seldom see, because part of the nature of
it is that working people who live there, like me, are mostly gone,
filling the roles of strangers on other sidewalks. But from days off, I
know enough of it to know that it becomes []{#calibre_link-508 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="52"}more and more intricate. Longshoremen who
are not working that day gather at the White Horse or the Ideal or the
International for beer and conversation. The executives and business
lunchers from the industries just to the west throng the Dorgene
restaurant and the Lion's Head coffee house; meat-market workers and
communications scientists fill the bakery lunchroom. Character dancers
come on, a strange old man with strings of old shoes over his shoulders,
motor-scooter riders with big beards and girl friends who bounce on the
back of the scooters and wear their hair long in front of their faces as
well as behind, drunks who follow the advice of the Hat Council and are
always turned out in hats, but not hats the Council would approve. Mr.
Lacey, the locksmith, shuts up his shop for a while and goes to exchange
the time of day with Mr. Slube at the cigar store. Mr. Koochagian, the
tailor, waters the luxuriant jungle of plants in his window, gives them
a critical look from the outside, accepts a compliment on them from two
passers-by, fingers the leaves on the plane tree in front of our house
with a thoughtful gardener's appraisal, and crosses the street for a
bite at the Ideal where he can keep an eye on customers and wigwag
across the message that he is coming. The baby carriages come out, and
clusters of everyone from toddlers with dolls to teen-agers with
homework gather at the stoops.

When I get home after work, the ballet is reaching its crescendo. This
is the time of roller skates and stilts and tricycles, and games in the
lee of the stoop with bottletops and plastic cowboys; this is the time
of bundles and packages, zigzagging from the drug store to the fruit
stand and back over to the butcher's; this is the time when teen-agers,
all dressed up, are pausing to ask if their slips show or their collars
look right; this is the time when beautiful girls get out of MG's; this
is the time when the fire engines go through; this is the time when
anybody you know around Hudson Street will go by.

As darkness thickens and Mr. Halpert moors the laundry cart to the
cellar door again, the ballet goes on under lights, eddying back and
forth but intensifying at the bright spotlight pools of Joe's sidewalk
pizza dispensary, the bars, the delicatessen, the restaurant and the
drug store. The night workers stop now at []{#calibre_link-511 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="53"}the delicatessen, to pick up salami and a
container of milk. Things have settled down for the evening but the
street and its ballet have not come to a stop.

I know the deep night ballet and its seasons best from waking long after
midnight to tend a baby and, sitting in the dark, seeing the shadows and
hearing the sounds of the sidewalk. Mostly it is a sound like infinitely
pattering snatches of party conversation and, about three in the
morning, singing, very good singing. Sometimes there is sharpness and
anger or sad, sad weeping, or a flurry of search for a string of beads
broken. One night a young man came roaring along, bellowing terrible
language at two girls whom he had apparently picked up and who were
disappointing him. Doors opened, a wary semicircle formed around him,
not too close, until the police came. Out came the heads, too, along
Hudson Street, offering opinion, "Drunk...Crazy...A wild kid from the
suburbs."

Deep in the night, I am almost unaware how many people are on the street
unless something calls them together, like the bagpipe. Who the piper
was and why he favored our street I have no
idea.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-40){#calibre_link-42 .calibre7} The bagpipe
just skirled out in the February night, and as if it were a signal the
random, dwindled movements of the sidewalk took on direction. Swiftly,
quietly, almost magically a little crowd was there, a crowd that evolved
into a circle with a Highland fling inside it. The crowd could be seen
on the shadowy sidewalk, the dancers could be seen, but the bagpiper
himself was almost invisible because his bravura was all in his music.
He was a very little man in a plain brown overcoat. When he finished and
vanished, the dancers and watchers applauded, and applause came from the
galleries too, half a dozen of the hundred windows on Hudson Street.
Then the windows closed, and the little crowd dissolved into the random
movements of the night street.

The strangers on Hudson Street, the allies whose eyes help us natives
keep the peace of the street, are so many that they always seem to be
different people from one day to the next. That does
[]{#calibre_link-515 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="54"}not matter.
Whether they are so many always-different people as they seem to be, I
do not know. Likely they are. When Jimmy Rogan fell through a
plate-glass window (he was separating some scuffling friends) and almost
lost his arm, a stranger in an old T shirt emerged from the Ideal bar,
swiftly applied an expert tourniquet and, according to the hospital's
emergency staff, saved Jimmy's life. Nobody remembered seeing the man
before and no one has seen him since. The hospital was called in this
way: a woman sitting on the steps next to the accident ran over to the
bus stop, wordlessly snatched the dime from the hand of a stranger who
was waiting with his fifteen-cent fare ready, and raced into the Ideal's
phone booth. The stranger raced after her to offer the nickel too.
Nobody remembered seeing him before, and no one has seen him since. When
you see the same stranger three or four times on Hudson Street, you
begin to nod. This is almost getting to be an acquaintance, a public
acquaintance, of course.

I have made the daily ballet of Hudson Street sound more frenetic than
it is, because writing it telescopes it. In real life, it is not that
way. In real life, to be sure, something is always going on, the ballet
is never at a halt, but the general effect is peaceful and the general
tenor even leisurely. People who know well such animated city streets
will know how it is. I am afraid people who do not will always have it a
little wrong in their heads---like the old prints of rhinoceroses made
from travelers' descriptions of rhinoceroses.

On Hudson Street, the same as in the North End of Boston or in any other
animated neighborhoods of great cities, we are not innately more
competent at keeping the sidewalks safe than are the people who try to
live off the hostile truce of Turf in a blind-eyed city. We are the
lucky possessors of a city order that makes it relatively simple to keep
the peace because there are plenty of eyes on the street. But there is
nothing simple about that order itself, or the bewildering number of
components that go into it. Most of those components are specialized in
one way or another. They unite in their joint effect upon the sidewalk,
which is not specialized in the least. That is its strength.

# The uses of sidewalks: contact {#calibre_link-523 .chaphead1}
:::

Reformers have long observed city people loitering on busy corners,
hanging around in candy stores and bars and drinking soda pop on stoops,
and have passed a judgment, the gist of which is: "This is deplorable!
If these people had decent homes and a more private or bosky outdoor
place, they wouldn't be on the street!"

This judgment represents a profound misunderstanding of cities. It makes
no more sense than to drop in at a testimonial banquet in a hotel and
conclude that if these people had wives who could cook, they would give
their parties at home.

The point of both the testimonial banquet and the social life of city
sidewalks is precisely that they are public. They bring together people
who do not know each other in an intimate, private social fashion and in
most cases do not care to know each other in that fashion.

Nobody can keep open house in a great city. Nobody wants
[]{#calibre_link-528 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="56"}to. And yet
if interesting, useful and significant contacts among the people of
cities are confined to acquaintanceships suitable for private life, the
city becomes stultified. Cities are full of people with whom, from your
viewpoint, or mine, or any other individual's, a certain degree of
contact is useful or enjoyable; but you do not want them in your hair.
And they do not want you in theirs either.

In speaking about city sidewalk safety, I mentioned how necessary it is
that there should be, in the brains behind the eyes on the street, an
almost unconscious assumption of general street support when the chips
are down---when a citizen has to choose, for instance, whether he will
take responsibility, or abdicate it, in combating barbarism or
protecting strangers. There is a short word for this assumption of
support: trust. The trust of a city street is formed over time from
many, many little public sidewalk contacts. It grows out of people
stopping by at the bar for a beer, getting advice from the grocer and
giving advice to the newsstand man, comparing opinions with other
customers at the bakery and nodding hello to the two boys drinking pop
on the stoop, eying the girls while waiting to be called for dinner,
admonishing the children, hearing about a job from the hardware man and
borrowing a dollar from the druggist, admiring the new babies and
sympathizing over the way a coat faded. Customs vary: in some
neighborhoods people compare notes on their dogs; in others they compare
notes on their landlords.

Most of it is ostensibly utterly trivial but the sum is not trivial at
all. The sum of such casual, public contact at a local level---most of
it fortuitous, most of it associated with errands, all of it metered by
the person concerned and not thrust upon him by anyone---is a feeling
for the public identity of people, a web of public respect and trust,
and a resource in time of personal or neighborhood need. The absence of
this trust is a disaster to a city street. Its cultivation cannot be
institutionalized. And above all, *it implies no private commitments.*

I have seen a striking difference between presence and absence of casual
public trust on two sides of the same wide street in East Harlem,
composed of residents of roughly the same incomes []{#calibre_link-532
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="57"}and same races. On the old-city
side, which was full of public places and the sidewalk loitering so
deplored by Utopian minders of other people's leisure, the children were
being kept well in hand. On the project side of the street across the
way, the children, who had a fire hydrant open beside their play area,
were behaving destructively, drenching the open windows of houses with
water, squirting it on adults who ignorantly walked on the project side
of the street, throwing it into the windows of cars as they went by.
Nobody dared to stop them. These were anonymous children, and the
identities behind them were an unknown. What if you scolded or stopped
them? Who would back you up over there in the blind-eyed Turf? Would you
get, instead, revenge? Better to keep out of it. Impersonal city streets
make anonymous people, and this is not a matter of esthetic quality nor
of a mystical emotional effect in architectural scale. It is a matter of
what kinds of tangible enterprises sidewalks have, and therefore of how
people use the sidewalks in practical, everyday life.

The casual public sidewalk life of cities ties directly into other types
of public life, of which I shall mention one as illustrative, although
there is no end to their variety.

Formal types of local city organizations are frequently assumed by
planners and even by some social workers to grow in direct, common-sense
fashion out of announcements of meetings, the presence of meeting rooms,
and the existence of problems of obvious public concern. Perhaps they
grow so in suburbs and towns. They do not grow so in cities.

Formal public organizations in cities require an informal public life
underlying them, mediating between them and the privacy of the people of
the city. We catch a hint of what happens by contrasting, again, a city
area possessing a public sidewalk life with a city area lacking it, as
told about in the report of a settlement-house social researcher who was
studying problems relating to public schools in a section of New York
City:

> Mr. W------ \[principal of an elementary school\] was questioned on

Mr. W------ was wrong in one respect. There were not fewer places (or at
any rate there was not less space) for people to gather in the project,
if we count places deliberately planned for constructive socializing. Of
course there were no bars, no candy stores, no hole-in-the-wall
*bodegas,* no restaurants in the project. But the project under
discussion was equipped with a model complement of meeting rooms, craft,
art and game rooms, outdoor benches, malls, etc., enough to gladden the
heart of even the Garden City advocates.

Why are such places dead and useless without the most determined efforts
and expense to inveigle users---and then to maintain control over the
users? What services do the public sidewalk and its enterprises fulfill
that these planned gathering places do not? And why? How does an
informal public sidewalk life bolster a more formal, organizational
public life?

::: {#calibre_link-540 .section_break}

:::

To understand such problems---to understand why drinking pop on the
stoop differs from drinking pop in the game room, and why getting advice
from the grocer or the bartender differs from getting advice from either
your next-door neighbor or from an institutional lady who may be
hand-in-glove with an institutional landlord---we must look into the
matter of city privacy.

Privacy is precious in cities. It is indispensable. Perhaps it is
precious and indispensable everywhere, but most places you cannot get
it. In small settlements everyone knows your affairs. In the city
everyone does not---only those you choose to tell will know much about
you. This is one of the attributes of cities that is precious to most
city people, whether their incomes are high or their incomes are low,
whether they are white or colored, []{#calibre_link-543 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="59"}whether they are old inhabitants or new, and
it is a gift of great-city life deeply cherished and jealously guarded.

Architectural and planning literature deals with privacy in terms of
windows, overlooks, sight lines. The idea is that if no one from outside
can peek into where you live---behold, privacy. This is simple-minded.
Window privacy is the easiest commodity in the world to get. You just
pull down the shades or adjust the blinds. The privacy of keeping one's
personal affairs to those selected to know them, and the privacy of
having reasonable control over who shall make inroads on your time and
when, are rare commodities in most of this world, however, and they have
nothing to do with the orientation of windows.

Anthropologist Elena Padilla, author of *Up from Puerto Rico*,
describing Puerto Rican life in a poor and squalid district of New York,
tells how much people know about each other---who is to be trusted and
who not, who is defiant of the law and who upholds it, who is competent
and well informed and who is inept and ignorant---and how these things
are known from the public life of the sidewalk and its associated
enterprises. These are matters of public character. But she also tells
how select are those permitted to drop into the kitchen for a cup of
coffee, how strong are the ties, and how limited the number of a
person's genuine confidants, those who share in a person's private life
and private affairs. She tells how it is not considered dignified for
everyone to know one's affairs. Nor is it considered dignified to snoop
on others beyond the face presented in public. It does violence to a
person's privacy and rights. In this, the people she describes are
essentially the same as the people of the mixed, Americanized city
street on which I live, and essentially the same as the people who live
in high-income apartments or fine town houses, too.

A good city street neighborhood achieves a marvel of balance between its
people's determination to have essential privacy and their simultaneous
wishes for differing degrees of contact, enjoyment or help from the
people around. This balance is largely made up of small, sensitively
managed details, practiced and accepted so casually that they are
normally taken for granted.

Perhaps I can best explain this subtle but all-important balance in
terms of the stores where people leave keys for their friends, a
[]{#calibre_link-548 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="60"}common custom
in New York. In our family, for example, when a friend wants to use our
place while we are away for a week end or everyone happens to be out
during the day, or a visitor for whom we do not wish to wait up is
spending the night, we tell such a friend that he can pick up the key at
the delicatessen across the street. Joe Cornacchia, who keeps the
delicatessen, usually has a dozen or so keys at a time for handing out
like this. He has a special drawer for them.

Now why do I, and many others, select Joe as a logical custodian for
keys? Because we trust him, first, to be a responsible custodian, but
equally important because we know that he combines a feeling of good
will with a feeling of no personal responsibility about our private
affairs. Joe considers it no concern of his whom we choose to permit in
our places and why.

Around on the other side of our block, people leave their keys at a
Spanish grocery. On the other side of Joe's block, people leave them at
the candy store. Down a block they leave them at the coffee shop, and a
few hundred feet around the corner from that, in a barber shop. Around
one corner from two fashionable blocks of town houses and apartments in
the Upper East Side, people leave their keys in a butcher shop and a
bookshop; around another corner they leave them in a cleaner's and a
drug store. In unfashionable East Harlem keys are left with at least one
florist, in bakeries, in luncheonettes, in Spanish and Italian
groceries.

The point, wherever they are left, is not the kind of ostensible service
that the enterprise offers, but the kind of proprietor it has.

A service like this cannot be formalized.
Identifications...questions...insurance against mishaps. The
all-essential line between public service and privacy would be
transgressed by insti­tutio­naliz­ation. Nobody in his right mind would
leave his key in such a place. The service must be given as a favor by
someone with an unshakable understanding of the difference between a
person's key and a person's private life, or it cannot be given at all.

Or consider the line drawn by Mr. Jaffe at the candy store around our
corner---a line so well understood by his customers []{#calibre_link-554
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="61"}and by other storekeepers too that
they can spend their whole lives in its presence and never think about
it consciously. One ordinary morning last winter, Mr. Jaffe, whose
formal business name is Bernie, and his wife, whose formal business name
is Ann, supervised the small children crossing at the corner on the way
to P.S. 41, as Bernie always does because he sees the need; lent an
umbrella to one customer and a dollar to another; took custody of two
keys; took in some packages for people in the next building who were
away; lectured two youngsters who asked for cigarettes; gave street
directions; took custody of a watch to give the repair man across the
street when he opened later; gave out information on the range of rents
in the neighborhood to an apartment seeker; listened to a tale of
domestic difficulty and offered reassurance; told some rowdies they
could not come in unless they behaved and then defined (and got) good
behavior; provided an incidental forum for half a dozen conversations
among customers who dropped in for oddments; set aside certain newly
arrived papers and magazines for regular customers who would depend on
getting them; advised a mother who came for a birthday present not to
get the ship-model kit because another child going to the same birthday
party was giving that; and got a back copy (this was for me) of the
previous day's newspaper out of the deliverer's surplus returns when he
came by.

After considering this multiplicity of extra-merchandising services I
asked Bernie, "Do you ever introduce your customers to each other?"

He looked startled at the idea, even dismayed. "No," he said
thoughtfully. "That would just not be advisable. Sometimes, if I know
two customers who are in at the same time have an interest in common, I
bring up the subject in conversation and let them carry it on from there
if they want to. But oh no, I wouldn't introduce them."

When I told this to an acquaintance in a suburb, she promptly assumed
that Mr. Jaffe felt that to make an introduction would be to step above
his social class. Not at all. In our neighborhood, storekeepers like the
Jaffes enjoy an excellent social status, that of businessmen. In income
they are apt to be the peers of the general run of customers and in
independence they are the []{#calibre_link-558 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="62"}superiors. Their advice, as men or women of
common sense and experience, is sought and respected. They are well
known as individuals, rather than unknown as class symbols. No; this is
that almost unconsciously enforced, well-balanced line showing, the line
between the city public world and the world of privacy.

This line can be maintained, without awkwardness to anyone, because of
the great plenty of opportunities for public contact in the enterprises
along the sidewalks, or on the sidewalks themselves as people move to
and fro or deliberately loiter when they feel like it, and also because
of the presence of many public hosts, so to speak, proprietors of
meeting places like Bernie's where one is free either to hang around or
dash in and out, no strings attached.

Under this system, it is possible in a city street neighborhood to know
all kinds of people without unwelcome entanglements, without boredom,
necessity for excuses, explanations, fears of giving offense,
embarrassments respecting impositions or commitments, and all such
paraphernalia of obligations which can accompany less limited
relationships. It is possible to be on excellent sidewalk terms with
people who are very different from oneself, and even, as time passes, on
familiar public terms with them. Such relationships can, and do, endure
for many years, for decades; they could never have formed without that
line, much less endured. They form precisely because they are by-the-way
to people's normal public sorties.

"Togetherness" is a fittingly nauseating name for an old ideal in
planning theory. This ideal is that if anything is shared among people,
much should be shared. "Togetherness," apparently a spiritual resource
of the new suburbs, works destructively in cities. The requirement that
much shall be shared drives city people apart.

When an area of a city lacks a sidewalk life, the people of the place
must enlarge their private lives if they are to have anything
approaching equivalent contact with their neighbors. They must settle
for some form of "togetherness," in which more is shared with one
another than in the life of the sidewalks, or else they
[]{#calibre_link-564 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="63"}must settle
for lack of contact. Inevitably the outcome is one or the other; it has
to be; and either has distressing results.

In the case of the first outcome, where people do share much, they
become exceedingly choosy as to who their neighbors are, or with whom
they associate at all. They have to become so. A friend of mine, Penny
Kostritsky, is unwittingly and unwillingly in this fix on a street in
Baltimore. Her street of nothing but residences, embedded in an area of
almost nothing but residences, has been experimentally equipped with a
charming sidewalk park. The sidewalk has been widened and attractively
paved, wheeled traffic discouraged from the narrow street roadbed, trees
and flowers planted, and a piece of play sculpture is to go in. All
these are splendid ideas so far as they go.

However, there are no stores. The mothers from nearby blocks who bring
small children here, and come here to find some contact with others
themselves, perforce go into the houses of acquaintances along the
street to warm up in winter, to make telephone calls, to take their
children in emergencies to the bathroom. Their hostesses offer them
coffee, for there is no other place to get coffee, and naturally
considerable social life of this kind has arisen around the park. Much
is shared.

Mrs. Kostritsky, who lives in one of the conveniently located houses,
and who has two small children, is in the thick of this narrow and
accidental social life. "I have lost the advantage of living in the
city," she says, "without getting the advantages of living in the
suburbs." Still more distressing, when mothers of different income or
color or educational background bring their children to the street park,
they and their children are rudely and pointedly ostracized. They fit
awkwardly into the suburbanlike sharing of private lives that has grown
in default of city sidewalk life. The park lacks benches purposely; the
"togetherness" people ruled them out because they might be interpreted
as an invitation to people who cannot fit in.

"If only we had a couple of stores on the street," Mrs. Kostritsky
laments. "If only there were a grocery store or a drug store or a snack
joint. Then the telephone calls and the warming up and the gathering
could be done naturally in public, and then people []{#calibre_link-569
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="64"}would act more decent to each
other because everybody would have a right to be here."

Much the same thing that happens in this sidewalk park without a city
public life happens sometimes in middle-class projects and colonies,
such as Chatham Village in Pittsburgh for example, a famous model of
Garden City planning.

The houses here are grouped in colonies around shared interior lawns and
play yards, and the whole development is equipped with other devices for
close sharing, such as a residents' club which holds parties, dances,
reunions, has ladies' activities like bridge and sewing parties, and
holds dances and parties for the children. There is no public life here,
in any city sense. There are differing degrees of extended private life.

Chatham Village's success as a "model" neighborhood where much is shared
has required that the residents be similar to one another in their
standards, interests and backgrounds. In the main they are middle-class
professionals and their families. It has also required that residents
set themselves distinctly apart from the different people in the
surrounding city; these are in the main also middle class, but lower
middle class, and this is too different for the degree of chumminess
that neighborliness in Chatham Village entails.

The inevitable insularity (and homogeneity) of Chatham Village has
practical consequences. As one illustration, the junior high school
serving the area has problems, as all schools do. Chatham Village is
large enough to dominate the elementary school to which its children go,
and therefore to work at helping solve this school's problems. To deal
with the junior high, however, Chatham Village's people must cooperate
with entirely different neighborhoods. But there is no public
acquaintanceship, no foundation of casual public trust, no
cross-connections with the necessary people---and no practice or ease in
applying the most ordinary techniques of city public life at lowly
levels.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-43){#calibre_link-46 .calibre7} Feeling
helpless, as indeed they are, some Chatham Village families move away
when their children reach junior high age; others contrive
[]{#calibre_link-574 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="65"}to send them
to private high schools. Ironically, just such neighborhood islands as
Chatham Village are encouraged in orthodox planning on the specific
grounds that cities need the talents and stabilizing influence of the
middle class. Presumably these qualities are to seep out by osmosis.

People who do not fit happily into such colonies eventually get out, and
in time managements become sophisticated in knowing who among applicants
will fit in. Along with basic similarities of standards, values and
backgrounds, the arrangement seems to demand a formidable amount of
forbearance and tact.

City residential planning that depends, for contact among neighbors, on
personal sharing of this sort, and that cultivates it, often does work
well socially, if rather narrowly, *for self-selected upper-middle-class
people*. It solves easy problems for an easy kind of population. So far
as I have been able to discover, it fails to work, however, even on its
own terms, *with any other kind of population*.

The more common outcome in cities, where people are faced with the
choice of sharing much or nothing, is nothing. In city areas that lack a
natural and casual public life, it is common for residents to isolate
themselves from each other to a fantastic degree. If mere contact with
your neighbors threatens to entangle you in their private lives, or
entangle them in yours, and if you cannot be so careful who your
neighbors are as self-selected upper-middle-class people can be, the
logical solution is absolutely to avoid friendliness or casual offers of
help. Better to stay thoroughly distant. As a practical result, the
ordinary public jobs---like keeping children in hand---for which people
must take a little personal initiative, or those for which they must
band together in limited common purposes, go undone. The abysses this
opens up can be almost unbelievable.

For example, in one New York City project which is designed---like all
orthodox residential city planning---for sharing much or nothing, a
remarkably outgoing woman prided herself that she had become acquainted,
by making a deliberate effort, with the mothers of every one of the
ninety families in her building. She called on them. She buttonholed
them at the door or in the hall. She struck up conversations if she sat
beside them on a bench.

[]{#calibre_link-580 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="66"}It so
happened that her eight-year-old son, one day, got stuck in the elevator
and was left there without help for more than two hours, although he
screamed, cried and pounded. The next day the mother expressed her
dismay to one of her ninety acquaintances. "Oh, was that *your* son?"
said the other woman. "I didn't know whose boy he was. If I had realized
he was *your* son I would have helped him."

This woman, who had not behaved in any such insanely calloused fashion
on her old public street---to which she constantly returned, by the way,
for public life---was afraid of a possible entanglement that might not
be kept easily on a public plane.

Dozens of illustrations of this defense can be found wherever the choice
is sharing much or nothing. A thorough and detailed report by Ellen
Lurie, a social worker in East Harlem, on life in a low-income project
there, has this to say:

> It is...extremely important to recognize that for considerably
> complicated reasons, many adults either don't want to become involved

Along with nothingness, considerable "togetherness" can be found in such
places, however. Mrs. Lurie reports on this type of relationship:

> Often two women from two different buildings will meet in the laundry
> room, recognize each other; although they may never have spoken a
> single word to each other back on 99th Street, suddenly here they

> in her own building, the other is likely to be drawn into that circle
> and begins to make her friendships, not with women on her floor, but
> rather on her friend's floor.

These friendships do not go into an ever-widening circle. There are
certain definite well-traveled paths in the project, and after a while
no new people are met.

Mrs. Lurie, who works at community organization in East Harlem, with
remarkable success, has looked into the history of many past attempts at
project tenant organization. She has told []{#calibre_link-594 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="68"}me that "togetherness," itself, is one of
the factors that make this kind of organization so difficult. "These
projects are not lacking in natural leaders," she says. "They contain
people with real ability, wonderful people many of them, but the typical
sequence is that in the course of organization leaders have found each
other, gotten all involved in each others' social lives, and have ended
up talking to nobody but each other. They have not found their
followers. Everything tends to degenerate into ineffective cliques, as a
natural course. There is no normal public life. Just the mechanics of
people learning what is going on is so difficult. It all makes the
simplest social gain extra hard for these people."

Residents of unplanned city residential areas that lack neighborhood
commerce and sidewalk life seem sometimes to follow the same course as
residents of public projects when faced with the choice of sharing much
or nothing. Thus researchers hunting the secrets of the social structure
in a dull gray-area district of Detroit came to the unexpected
conclusion there was no social structure.

::: {#calibre_link-596 .section_break}
---
:::

The social structure of sidewalk life hangs partly on what can be called
self-appointed public characters. A public character is anyone who is in
frequent contact with a wide circle of people and who is sufficiently
interested to make himself a public character. A public character need
have no special talents or wisdom to fulfill his function---although he
often does. He just needs to be present, and there need to be enough of
his counterparts. His main qualification is that he *is* public, that he
talks to lots of different people. In this way, news travels that is of
sidewalk interest.

Most public sidewalk characters are steadily stationed in public places.
They are storekeepers or barkeepers or the like. These are the basic
public characters. All other public characters of city sidewalks depend
on them---if only indirectly because of the presence of sidewalk routes
to such enterprises and their proprietors.

Settlement-house workers and pastors, two more formalized kinds of
public characters, typically depend on the street grapevine news systems
that have their ganglia in the stores. The director of a settlement on
New York's Lower East Side, as an []{#calibre_link-600 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="69"}example, makes a regular round of stores. He
learns from the cleaner who does his suits about the presence of dope
pushers in the neighborhood. He learns from the grocer that the Dragons
are working up to something and need attention. He learns from the candy
store that two girls are agitating the Sportsmen toward a rumble. One of
his most important information spots is an unused breadbox on Rivington
Street. That is, it is not used for bread. It stands outside a grocery
and is used for sitting on and lounging beside, between the settlement
house, a candy store and a pool parlor. A message spoken there for any
teen-ager within many blocks will reach his ears unerringly and
surprisingly quickly, and the opposite flow along the grapevine
similarly brings news quickly in to the breadbox.

Blake Hobbs, the head of the Union Settlement music school in East
Harlem, notes that when he gets a first student from one block of the
old busy street neighborhoods, he rapidly gets at least three or four
more and sometimes almost every child on the block. But when he gets a
child from the nearby projects---perhaps through the public school or a
playground conversation he has initiated---he almost never gets another
as a direct sequence. Word does not move around where public characters
and sidewalk life are lacking.

Besides the anchored public characters of the sidewalk, and the
well-recognized roving public characters, there are apt to be various
more specialized public characters on a city sidewalk. In a curious way,
some of these help establish an identity not only for themselves but for
others. Describing the everyday life of a retired tenor at such sidewalk
establishments as the restaurant and the *bocce* court, a San Francisco
news story notes, "It is said of Meloni that because of his intensity,
his dramatic manner and his lifelong interest in music, he transmits a
feeling of vicarious importance to his many friends." Precisely.

One need not have either the artistry or the personality of such a man
to become a specialized sidewalk character---but only a pertinent
specialty of some sort. It is easy. I am a specialized public character
of sorts along our street, owing of course to the fundamental presence
of the basic, anchored public characters. The way I became one started
with the fact that Greenwich Village, []{#calibre_link-604 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="70"}where I live, was waging an interminable and
horrendous battle to save its main park from being bisected by a
highway. During the course of battle I undertook, at the behest of a
committee organizer away over on the other side of Greenwich Village, to
deposit in stores on a few blocks of our street supplies of petition
cards protesting the proposed roadway. Customers would sign the cards
while in the stores, and from time to time I would make my pickups. As a
result of engaging in this messenger work, I have since become
automatically the sidewalk public character on petition strategy. Before
long, for instance, Mr. Fox at the liquor store was consulting me, as he
wrapped up my bottle, on how we could get the city to remove a long
abandoned and dangerous eyesore, a closed-up comfort station near his
corner. If I would undertake to compose the petitions and find the
effective way of presenting them to City Hall, he proposed, he and his
partners would undertake to have them printed, circulated and picked up.
Soon the stores round about had comfort station removal petitions. Our
street by now has many public experts on petition tactics, including the
children.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-45){#calibre_link-48 .calibre7}

Not only do public characters spread the news and learn the news at
retail, so to speak. They connect with each other and thus spread word
wholesale, in effect.

A sidewalk life, so far as I can observe, arises out of no mysterious
qualities or talents for it in this or that type of population. It
arises only when the concrete, tangible facilities it requires are
present. These happen to be the same facilities, in the same abundance
and ubiquity, that are required for cultivating sidewalk safety. If they
are absent, public sidewalk contacts are absent too.

The well-off have many ways of assuaging needs for which poorer people
may depend much on sidewalk life---from hearing of jobs to being
recognized by the headwaiter. But nevertheless, many of the rich or
near-rich in cities appear to appreciate sidewalk life as much as
anybody. At any rate, they pay enormous rents to move into areas with an
exuberant and varied sidewalk life. They actually crowd out the middle
class and the poor in []{#calibre_link-608 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="71"}lively areas like Yorkville or Greenwich Village in New York,
or Telegraph Hill just off the North Beach streets of San Francisco.
They capriciously desert, after only a few decades of fashion at most,
the monotonous streets of "quiet residential areas" and leave them to
the less fortunate. Talk to residents of Georgetown in the District of
Columbia and by the second or third sentence at least you will begin to
hear rhapsodies about the charming restaurants, "more good restaurants
than in all the rest of the city put together," the uniqueness and
friendliness of the stores, the pleasures of running into people when
doing errands at the next corner---and nothing but pride over the fact
that Georgetown has become a specialty shopping district for its whole
metropolitan area. The city area, rich or poor or in between, harmed by
an interesting sidewalk life and plentiful sidewalk contacts has yet to
be found.

Efficiency of public sidewalk characters declines drastically if too
much burden is put upon them. A store, for example, can reach a turnover
in its contacts, or potential contacts, which is so large and so
superficial that it is socially useless. An example of this can be seen
at the candy and newspaper store owned by the housing cooperative of
Corlears Hook on New York's Lower East Side. This planned project store
replaces perhaps forty superficially similar stores which were wiped out
(without compensation to their proprietors) on that project site and the
adjoining sites. The place is a mill. Its clerks are so busy making
change and screaming ineffectual imprecations at rowdies that they never
hear anything except "I want that." This, or utter disinterest, is the
usual atmosphere where shopping center planning or repressive zoning
artificially contrives commercial monopolies for city neighborhoods. A
store like this would fail economically if it had competition. Meantime,
although monopoly insures the financial success planned for it, it fails
the city socially.

::: {#calibre_link-610 .section_break}

Sidewalk public contact and sidewalk public safety, taken together, bear
directly on our country's most serious social problem---segregation and
racial discrimination.

I do not mean to imply that a city's planning and design, or its types
of streets and street life, can automatically overcome segregation
[]{#calibre_link-613 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="72"}and
discrimination. Too many other kinds of effort are also required to
right these injustices.

But I do mean to say that to build and to rebuild big cities whose
sidewalks are unsafe and whose people must settle for sharing much or
nothing, *can* make it *much harder* for American cities to overcome
discrimination no matter how much effort is expended.

Considering the amount of prejudice and fear that accompany
discrimination and bolster it, overcoming residential discrimination is
just that much harder if people feel unsafe on their sidewalks anyway.
Overcoming residential discrimination comes hard where people have no
means of keeping a civilized public life on a basically dignified public
footing, and their private lives on a private footing.

To be sure, token model housing integration schemes here and there can
be achieved in city areas handicapped by danger and by lack of public
life---achieved by applying great effort and settling for abnormal
(abnormal for cities) choosiness among new neighbors. This is an evasion
of the size of the task and its urgency.

The tolerance, the room for great differences among
neighbors---differences that often go far deeper than differences in
color---which are possible and normal in intensely urban life, but which
are so foreign to suburbs and pseudosuburbs, are possible and normal
only when streets of great cities have built-in equipment allowing
strangers to dwell in peace together on civilized but essentially
dignified and reserved terms.

Lowly, unpurposeful and random as they may appear, sidewalk contacts are
the small change from which a city's wealth of public life may grow.

Los Angeles is an extreme example of a metropolis with little public
life, depending mainly instead on contacts of a more private social
nature.

On one plane, for instance, an acquaintance there comments that although
she has lived in the city for ten years and knows it contains Mexicans,
she, has never laid eyes on a Mexican or an item of Mexican culture,
much less ever exchanged any words with a Mexican.

[]{#calibre_link-623 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="73"}On another
plane, Orson Welles has written that Hollywood is the only theatrical
center in the world that has failed to develop a theatrical bistro.

And on still another plane, one of Los Angeles' most powerful
businessmen comes upon a blank in public relationships which would be
inconceivable in other cities of this size. This businessman,
volunteering that the city is "culturally behind," as he put it, told me
that he for one was at work to remedy this. He was heading a committee
to raise funds for a first-rate art museum. Later in our conversation,
after he had told me about the businessmen's club life of Los Angeles, a
life with which he is involved as one of its leaders, I asked him how or
where Hollywood people gathered in corresponding fashion. He was unable
to answer this. He then added that he knew no one at all connected with
the film industry, nor did he know anyone who did have such
acquaintanceship. "I know that must sound strange," he reflected. "We
are glad to have the film industry here, but those connected with it are
just not people one would know socially."

Here again is "togetherness" or nothing. Consider this man's handicap in
his attempts to get a metropolitan art museum established. He has no way
of reaching with any ease, practice or trust some of his committee's
potentially best prospects.

In its upper economic, political and cultural echelons, Los Angeles
operates according to the same provincial premises of social insularity
as the street with the sidewalk park in Baltimore or as Chatham Village
in Pittsburgh. Such a metropolis lacks means for bringing together
necessary ideas, necessary enthusiasms, necessary money. Los Angeles is
embarked on a strange experiment: trying to run not just projects, not
just gray areas, but a whole metropolis, by dint of "togetherness" or
nothing. I think this is an inevitable outcome for great cities whose
people lack city public life in ordinary living and working.

:::

Among the superstitions of planning and housing is a fantasy about the
transformation of children. It goes like this: A population of children
is condemned to play on the city streets. These pale and rickety
children, in their sinister moral environment, are telling each other
canards about sex, sniggering evilly and learning new forms of
corruption as efficiently as if they were in reform school. This
situation is called "the moral and physical toll taken of our youth by
the streets," sometimes it is called simply "the gutter."

If only these deprived children can be gotten off the streets into parks
and playgrounds with equipment on which to exercise, space in which to
run, grass to lift their souls! Clean and happy places, filled with the
laughter of children responding to a wholesome environment. So much for
the fantasy.

Let us consider a story from real life, as discovered by Charles
Guggenheim, a documentary-film maker in St. Louis. Guggenheim
[]{#calibre_link-636 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="75"}was working
on a film depicting the activities of a St. Louis children's day-care
center. He noticed that at the end of the afternoon roughly half the
children left with the greatest reluctance.

Guggenheim became sufficiently curious to investigate. Without
exception, the children who left unwillingly came from a nearby housing
project. And without exception again, those who left willingly came from
the old "slum" streets nearby. The mystery, Guggenheim found, was
simplicity itself. The children returning to the project, with its
generous playgrounds and lawns, ran a gauntlet of bullies who made them
turn out their pockets or submit to a beating, sometimes both. These
small children could not get home each day without enduring an ordeal
that they dreaded. The children going back to the old streets were safe
from extortion, Guggenheim found. They had many streets to select from,
and they astutely chose the safest. "If anybody picked on them, there
was always a storekeeper they could run to or somebody to come to their
aid," says Guggenheim. "They also had any number of ways of escaping
along different routes if anybody was laying for them. These little kids
felt safe and cocky and they enjoyed their trip home too." Guggenheim
made the related observation of how boring the project's landscaped
grounds and playgrounds were, how deserted they seemed, and in contrast
how rich in interest, variety and material for both the camera and the
imagination were the older streets nearby.

Consider another story from real life, an adolescent gang battle in the
summer of 1959 in New York, which culminated in the death of a
fifteen-year-old girl who had no connection with the battle, but
happened to be standing at the grounds of the project where she lives.
The events leading to the day's final tragedy, and their locales, were
reported by the *New York Post* during the subsequent trial, as follows:

> The first fracas occurred about noon when the Sportsmen stepped into
> the Forsyth St. Boys' turf in Sara Delano Roosevelt
> Park[\*^1^](#calibre_link-49){#calibre_link-51 .calibre7}...During the
> afternoon the decision was made by the []{#calibre_link-640 .calibre8
> type="pagebreak" title="76"}Forsyth St. Boys to use their ultimate

> the Lillian Wald housing project and, from the no-man's land of Avenue
> D \[the project grounds' boundary\] lobbed their gasoline bombs into
> the group while Cruz crouched and triggered the rifle.

Where did these three battles occur? In a park and at the parklike
grounds of the project. After outbreaks of this kind, one of the
remedies invariably called for is more parks and playgrounds. We are
bemused by the sound of symbols.

"Street gangs" do their "street fighting" predominately in parks and
playgrounds. When the *New York Times* in September 1959 summed up the
worst adolescent gang outbreaks of the past decade in the city, each and
every one was designated as having occurred in a park. Moreover, more
and more frequently, not only in New York but in other cities too,
children engaged in such horrors turn out to be from super-block
projects, where their everyday play has successfully been removed from
the streets (the streets themselves have largely been removed). The
highest delinquency belt in New York's Lower East Side, where the gang
war described above occurred, is precisely the parklike belt of public
housing projects. The two most formidable gangs in Brooklyn are rooted
in two of the oldest projects. Ralph Whelan, director of the New York
City Youth Board, reports, according to the *New York Times*, an
"invariable rise in delinquency rates" wherever a new housing project is
built. The worst girls' gang in Philadelphia has grown up on the grounds
of that city's second-oldest housing project, and the highest
delinquency []{#calibre_link-643 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="77"}belt of that city corresponds with its major belt of
projects. In St. Louis the project where Guggenheim found the extortion
going on is considered relatively safe compared with the city's largest
project, fifty-seven acres of mostly grass, dotted with playgrounds and
devoid of city streets, a prime breeding ground of delinquency in that
city. Such projects are examples, among other things, of an intent to
take children off the streets. They are designed as they are partly for
just this purpose.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-50){#calibre_link-52 .calibre7}

The disappointing results are hardly strange. The same rules of city
safety and city public life that apply to adults apply to children too,
except that children are even more vulnerable to danger and barbarism
than adults.

In real life, what significant change *does* occur if children are
transferred from a lively city street to the usual park or to the usual
public or project playground?

In most cases (not all, fortunately), the most significant change is
this: The children have moved from under the eyes of a high numerical
ratio of adults, into a place where the ratio of adults is low or even
nil. To think this represents an improvement in city child rearing is
pure daydreaming.

City children themselves know this; they have known it for generations.
"When we wanted to do anything antisocial, we always made for Lindy Park
because none of the grownups would see us there," says Jesse Reichek, an
artist who grew up in Brooklyn. "Mostly we played on the streets where
we couldn't get away with anything much."

Life is the same today. My son, reporting how he escaped four boys who
set upon him, says, "I was scared they would catch me when I had to pass
the playground. If they caught me *there* I'd be sunk!"

A few days after the murder of two sixteen-year-old boys in a playground
on the midtown West Side of Manhattan, I paid a morbid visit to the
area. The nearby streets were evidently back to normal. Hundreds of
children, directly under the eyes of innumerable adults using the
sidewalks themselves and looking from []{#calibre_link-650 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="78"}windows, were engaged in a vast variety of
sidewalk games and whooping pursuits. The sidewalks were dirty, they
were too narrow for the demands put upon them, and they needed shade
from the sun. But here was no scene of arson, mayhem or the flourishing
of dangerous weapons. In the playground where the nighttime murder had
occurred, things were apparently back to normal too. Three small boys
were setting a fire under a wooden bench. Another was having his head
beaten against the concrete. The custodian was absorbed in solemnly and
slowly hauling down the American flag.

On my return home, as I passed the relatively genteel playground near
where I live, I noted that its only inhabitants in the late afternoon,
with the mothers and the custodian gone, were two small boys threatening
to bash a little girl with their skates, and an alcoholic who had roused
himself to shake his head and mumble that they shouldn't do that.
Farther down the street, on a block with many Puerto Rican immigrants,
was another scene of contrast. Twenty-eight children of all ages were
playing on the sidewalk without mayhem, arson, or any event more serious
than a squabble over a bag of candy. They were under the casual
surveillance of adults primarily visiting in public with each other. The
surveillance was only seemingly casual, as was proved when the candy
squabble broke out and peace and justice were re-established. The
identities of the adults kept changing because different ones kept
putting their heads out the windows, and different ones kept coming in
and going out on errands, or passing by and lingering a little. But the
numbers of adults stayed fairly constant---between eight and
eleven---during the hour I watched. Arriving home, I noticed that at our
end of our block, in front of the tenement, the tailor's, our house, the
laundry, the pizza place and the fruit man's, twelve children were
playing on the sidewalk in sight of fourteen adults.

To be sure, all city sidewalks are not under surveillance in this
fashion, and this is one of the troubles of the city that planning ought
properly to help correct. Underused sidewalks are not under suitable
surveillance for child rearing. Nor are sidewalks apt to be safe, even
with eyes upon them, if they are bordered by a population which is
constantly and rapidly turning over in residence---another
[]{#calibre_link-653 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="79"}urgent
planning problem. But the playgrounds and parks near such streets are
even less wholesome.

Nor are all playgrounds and parks unsafe or under poor surveillance, as
we shall see in the next chapter. But those that are wholesome are
typically in neighborhoods where streets are lively and safe and where a
strong tone of civilized public sidewalk life prevails. Whatever
differentials exist in safety and wholesomeness between playgrounds and
sidewalks in any given area are invariably, so far as I can find, in the
favor of the much maligned streets.

People with actual, not theoretical, responsibility for bringing up
children in cities often know this well. "You can go out," say city
mothers, "but stay on the sidewalk." I say it to my own children. And by
this we mean more than "Don't go into the street where the cars are."

Describing the miraculous rescue of a nine-year-old boy who was pushed
down a sewer by an unidentified assailant---in a park, of course---the
*New York Times* reported, "The mother had told the boys earlier in the
day not to play in High Bridge Park...Finally she said all right." The
boy's frightened companions intelligently raced out of the park and back
to the evil streets where they enlisted help quickly.

Frank Havey, the settlement-house director in Boston's North End, says
that parents come to him time and again with this problem: "I tell my
children to play on the sidewalk after supper. But I hear children
shouldn't play on the street. Am I doing wrong?" Havey tells them they
are doing right. He attributes much of the North End's low delinquency
rate to the excellent community surveillance of children at play where
the community is at its strongest---on the sidewalks.

Garden City planners, with their hatred of the street, thought the
solution to keeping children off the streets *and* under wholesome
surveillance was to build interior enclaves for them in the centers of
super-blocks. This policy has been inherited by the designers of Radiant
Garden City. Today many large renewal areas are being replanned on the
principle of enclosed park enclaves within blocks.

The trouble with this scheme, as can be seen in such already
[]{#calibre_link-660 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="80"}existing
examples as Chatham Village in Pittsburgh and Baldwin Hills Village in
Los Angeles, and smaller courtyard colonies in New York and Baltimore,
is that no child of enterprise or spirit will willingly stay in such a
boring place after he reaches the age of six. Most want out earlier.
These sheltered, "togetherness" worlds are suitable, and in real life
are used, for about three or four years of a small child's life, in many
ways the easiest four years to manage. Nor do the adult residents of
these places even want the play of older children in their sheltered
courts. In Chatham Village and Baldwin Hills Village it is expressly
forbidden. Little tots are decorative and relatively docile, but older
children are noisy and energetic, and they act on their environment
instead of just letting it act on them. Since the environment is already
"perfect" this will not do. Furthermore, as can also be seen both in
examples already existing and in plans for construction, this type of
planning requires that buildings be oriented toward the interior
enclave. Otherwise the enclave's prettiness goes unexploited and it is
left without easy surveillance and access. The relatively dead backs of
the buildings or, worse still, blank end walls, thus face on the
streets. The safety of the unspecialized sidewalks is thus exchanged for
a specialized form of safety for a specialized part of the population
for a few years of its life. When the children venture forth, as they
must and will, they are ill served, along with everyone else.

I have been dwelling on a negative aspect of child rearing in cities:
the factor of protection---protection of children from their own
idiocies, from adults bent on ill, and from each other. I have dwelt on
it because it has been my purpose to show, by means of the most easily
understood problem, how nonsensical is the fantasy that playgrounds and
parks are automatically O.K. places for children, and streets are
automatically not O.K. places for children.

But lively sidewalks have positive aspects for city children's play too,
and these are at least as important as safety and protection.

::: {#calibre_link-663 .section_break}

Children in cities need a variety of places in which to play and to
learn. They need, among other things, opportunities for all
[]{#calibre_link-665 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="81"}kinds of
sports and exercise and physical skills---more opportunities, more
easily obtained, than they now enjoy in most cases. However, at the same
time, they need an unspecialized outdoor home base from which to play,
to hang around in, and to help form their notions of the world.

It is this form of unspecialized play that the sidewalks serve---and
that lively city sidewalks can serve splendidly. When this home-base
play is transferred to playgrounds and parks it is not only provided for
unsafely, but paid personnel, equipment and space are frittered away
that could be devoted instead to more ice-skating rinks, swimming pools,
boat ponds and other various and specific outdoor uses. Poor,
generalized play use eats up substance that could instead be used for
good specialized play.

To waste the normal presence of adults on lively sidewalks and to bank
instead (however idealistically) on hiring substitutes for them, is
frivolous in the extreme. It is frivolous not only socially but also
economically, because cities have desperate shortages of money and of
personnel for more interesting uses of the outdoors than
playgrounds---and of money and personnel for other aspects of children's
lives. For example, city school systems today typically have between
thirty and forty children in their classes---sometimes more---and these
include children with all manner of problems too, from ignorance of
English to bad emotional upsets. City schools need something approaching
a 50-percent increase in teachers to handle severe problems and also
reduce normal class sizes to a figure permitting better education. New
York's city-run hospitals in 1959 had 58 percent of their professional
nursing positions unfilled, and in many another city the shortage of
nurses has become alarming. Libraries, and often museums, curtail their
hours, and notably the hours of their children's sections. Funds are
lacking for the increased numbers of settlement houses drastically
needed in the new slums and new projects of cities. Even the existing
settlement houses lack funds for needed expansions and changes in their
programs, in short for more staff. Requirements like these should have
high priority on public and philanthropic funds---not only on funds at
the present dismally inadequate levels, but on funds greatly increased.

The people of cities who have other jobs and duties, and who
[]{#calibre_link-669 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="82"}lack, too,
the training needed, cannot volunteer as teachers or registered nurses
or librarians or museum guards or social workers. But at least they can,
and on lively diversified sidewalks they do, supervise the incidental
play of children and assimilate the children into city society. They do
it *in the course of carrying on their other pursuits.*

Planners do not seem to realize how high a ratio of adults is needed to
rear children at incidental play. Nor do they seem to understand that
spaces and equipment do not rear children. These can be useful adjuncts,
but only people rear children and assimilate them into civilized
society.

It is folly to build cities in a way that wastes this normal, casual
manpower for child rearing and either leaves this essential job too much
undone---with terrible consequences---or makes it necessary to hire
substitutes. The myth that playgrounds and grass and hired guards or
supervisors are innately wholesome for children and that city streets,
filled with ordinary people, are innately evil for children, boils down
to a deep contempt for ordinary people.

In real life, only from the ordinary adults of the city sidewalks do
children learn---if they learn it at all---the first fundamental of
successful city life: People must take a modicum of public
responsibility for each other even if they have no ties to each other.
This is a lesson nobody learns by being told. It is learned from the
experience of having *other people without ties of kinship or close
friendship or formal responsibility to you* take a modicum of public
responsibility for you. When Mr. Lacey, the locksmith, bawls out one of
my sons for running into the street, and then later reports the
transgression to my husband as he passes the locksmith shop, my son gets
more than an overt lesson in safety and obedience. He also gets,
indirectly, the lesson that Mr. Lacey, with whom we have no ties other
than street propinquity, feels responsible for him to a degree. The boy
who went unrescued in the elevator in the "togethemess"-or-nothing
project learns opposite lessons from his experiences. So do the project
children who squirt water into house windows and on passers-by, and go
unrebuked because they are anonymous children in anonymous grounds.

[]{#calibre_link-674 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="83"}The lesson
that city dwellers have to take responsibility for what goes on in city
streets is taught again and again to children on sidewalks which enjoy a
local public life. They can absorb it astonishingly early. They show
they have absorbed it by taking it for granted that they, too, are part
of the management. They volunteer (before they are asked) directions to
people who are lost; they tell a man he will get a ticket if he parks
where he thinks he is going to park; they offer unsolicited advice to
the building superintendent to use rock salt instead of a chopper to
attack the ice. The presence or absence of this kind of street bossiness
in city children is a fairly good tip-off to the presence or absence of
responsible adult behavior toward the sidewalk and the children who use
it. The children are imitating adult attitudes. This has nothing to do
with income. Some of the poorest parts of cities do the best by their
children in this respect. And some do the worst.

This is instruction in city living that people hired to look after
children cannot teach, because the essence of this responsibility is
that you do it without being hired. It is a lesson that parents, by
themselves, are powerless to teach. If parents take minor public
responsibility for strangers or neighbors in a society where nobody else
does, this simply means that the parents are embarrassingly different
and meddlesome, not that this is the proper way to behave. Such
instruction must come from society itself, and in cities, if it comes,
it comes almost entirely during the time children spend at incidental
play on the sidewalks.

::: {#calibre_link-676 .section_break}

:::

Play on lively, diversified sidewalks differs from virtually all other
daily incidental play offered American children today: It is play not
conducted in a matriarchy.

Most city architectural designers and planners are men. Curiously, they
design and plan to exclude men as part of normal, daytime life wherever
people live. In planning residential life, they aim at filling the
presumed daily needs of impossibly vacuous housewives and preschool
tots. They plan, in short, strictly for matriarchal societies.

The ideal of a matriarchy inevitably accompanies all planning in which
residences are isolated from other parts of life. It accompanies
[]{#calibre_link-680 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="84"}all planning
for children in which their incidental play is set apart in its own
preserves. Whatever adult society does accompany the daily life of
children affected by such planning has to be a matriarchy. Chatham
Village, that Pittsburgh model of Garden City life, is as thoroughly
matriarchal in conception and in operation as the newest dormitory
suburb. All housing projects are.

Placing work and commerce *near* residences, but buffering it off, in
the tradition set by Garden City theory, is fully as matriarchal an
arrangement as if the residences were miles away from work and from men.
Men are not an abstraction. They are either around, in person, or they
are not. Working places and commerce must be mingled right in with
residences if men, like the men who work on or near Hudson Street, for
example, are to be around city children in daily life---men who are part
of normal daily life, as opposed to men who put in an occasional
playground appearance while they substitute for women or imitate the
occupations of women.

The opportunity (in modern life it has become a privilege) of playing
and growing up in a daily world composed of both men and women is
possible and usual for children who play on lively, diversified city
sidewalks. I cannot understand why this arrangement should be
discouraged by planning and by zoning. It ought, instead, to be abetted
by examining the conditions that stimulate minglings and mixtures of
work and commerce with residences, a subject taken up later in this
book.

The fascination of street life for city children has long been noted by
recreation experts, usually with disapproval. Back in 1928, the Regional
Plan Association of New York, in a report which remains to this day the
most exhaustive American study of big-city recreation, had this to say:

> Careful checking within a radius of ¼ mile of playgrounds under a wide
> range of conditions in many cities shows that about
> [![](images/000004.jpg){.inline}![](images/000004.jpg){.squeeze-amzn1}]{.figure_inline_small}

> playground activity so compellingly attractive as to draw the children
> from the streets and hold their interest from day to day is a rare
> faculty in play leadership, combining personality and technical skill
> of a high order.

The same report then deplores the stubborn tendency of children to "fool
around" instead of playing "recognized games." (Recognized by whom?)
This yearning for the Organization Child on the part of those who would
incarcerate incidental play, and children's stubborn preference for
fooling around on city streets, teeming with life and adventure, are
both as characteristic today as they were in 1928.

"I know Greenwich Village like my hand," brags my younger son, taking me
to see a "secret passage" he has discovered under a street, down one
subway stair and up another, and a secret hiding place some nine inches
wide between two buildings, where he secretes treasures that people have
put out for the sanitation truck collections along his morning route to
school and that he can thus save and retrieve on his return from school.
(I had such a hiding place, for the same purpose, at his age, but mine
was a crack in a cliff on my way to school instead of a crack between
two buildings, and he finds stranger and richer treasures.)

Why do children so frequently find that roaming the lively city
sidewalks is more interesting than back yards or playgrounds? Because
the sidewalks are more interesting. It is just as sensible to ask: Why
do adults find lively streets more interesting than playgrounds?

The wonderful convenience of city sidewalks is an important asset to
children too. Children are at the mercy of convenience more than anyone
else, except the aged. A great part of children's outdoor play,
especially after they start school, and after they also find a certain
number of organized activities (sports, arts, handcrafts or whatever
else their interests and the local opportunities provide), occurs at
incidental times and must be sandwiched in. A lot of outdoor life for
children adds up from bits. It happens in a small leftover interval
after lunch. It happens after school while children may be pondering
what to do and []{#calibre_link-691 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="86"}wondering who will turn up. It happens while they are waiting
to be called for their suppers. It happens in brief intervals between
supper and homework, or homework and bed.

During such times children have, and use, all manner of ways to exercise
and amuse themselves. They slop in puddles, write with chalk, jump rope,
roller skate, shoot marbles, trot out their possessions, converse, trade
cards, play stoop ball, walk stilts, decorate soap-box scooters,
dismember old baby carriages, climb on railings, run up and down. It is
not in the nature of things to make a big deal out of such activities.
It is not in the nature of things to go somewhere formally to do them by
plan, officially. Part of their charm is the accompanying sense of
freedom to roam up and down the sidewalks, a different matter from being
boxed into a preserve. If it is impossible to do such things both
incidentally and conveniently, they are seldom done.

As children get older, this incidental outdoor activity---say, while
waiting to be called to eat---becomes less bumptious physically and
entails more loitering with others, sizing people up, flirting, talking,
pushing, shoving and horseplay. Adolescents are always being criticized
for this kind of loitering, but they can hardly grow up without it. The
trouble comes when it is done not within society, but as a form of
outlaw life.

The requisite for any of these varieties of incidental play is not
pretentious equipment of any sort, but rather space at an immediately
convenient and interesting place. The play gets crowded out if sidewalks
are too narrow relative to the total demands put on them. It is
especially crowded out if the sidewalks also lack minor irregularities
in building line. An immense amount of both loitering and play goes on
in shallow sidewalk niches out of the line of moving pedestrian feet.

There is no point in planning for play on sidewalks unless the sidewalks
are used for a wide variety of other purposes and by a wide variety of
other people too. These uses need each other, for proper surveillance,
for a public life of some vitality, and for general interest. If
sidewalks on a lively street are sufficiently wide, play flourishes
mightily right along with other uses. If the sidewalks are skimped, rope
jumping is the first play casualty. []{#calibre_link-696 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="87"}Roller skating, tricycle and bicycle riding
are the next casualties. The narrower the sidewalks, the more sedentary
incidental play becomes. The more frequent too become sporadic forays by
children into the vehicular roadways.

Sidewalks thirty or thirty-five feet wide can accommodate virtually any
demand of incidental play put upon them---along with trees to shade the
activities, and sufficient space for pedestrian circulation and adult
public sidewalk life and loitering. Few sidewalks of this luxurious
width can be found. Sidewalk width is invariably sacrificed for
vehicular width, partly because city sidewalks are conventionally
considered to be purely space for pedestrian travel and access to
buildings, and go unrecognized and unrespected as the uniquely vital and
irreplaceable organs of city safety, public life and child rearing that
they are.

Twenty-foot sidewalks, which usually preclude rope jumping but can
feasibly permit roller skating and the use of other wheeled toys, can
still be found, although the street wideners erode them year by year
(often in the belief that shunned malls and "promenades" are a
constructive substitute). The livelier and more popular a sidewalk, and
the greater the number and variety of its users, the greater the total
width needed for it to serve its purposes pleasantly.

But even when proper space is lacking, convenience of location and the
interest of the streets are both so important to children---and good
surveillance so important to their parents---that children will and do
adapt to skimpy sidewalk space. This does not mean we do right in taking
unscrupulous advantage of their adaptability. In fact, we wrong both
them and cities.

Some city sidewalks are undoubtedly evil places for rearing children.
They are evil for anybody. In such neighborhoods we need to foster the
qualities and facilities that make for safety, vitality and stability in
city streets. This is a complex problem; it is a central problem of
planning for cities. In defective city neighborhoods, shooing the
children into parks and playgrounds is worse than useless, either as a
solution to the streets' problems or as a solution for the children.

The whole idea of doing away with city streets, insofar as
[]{#calibre_link-702 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="88"}that is
possible, and downgrading and minimizing their social and their economic
part in city life is the most mischievous and destructive idea in
orthodox city planning. That it is so often done in the name of vaporous
fantasies about city child care is as bitter as irony can get.

Conventionally, neighborhood parks or parklike open spaces are
considered boons conferred on the deprived populations of cities. Let us
turn this thought around, and consider city parks deprived places that
need the boon of life and appreciation conferred on *them.* This is more
nearly in accord with reality, for people do confer use on parks and
make them successes---or else withhold use and doom parks to rejection
and failure.

Parks are volatile places. They tend to run to extremes of popularity
and unpopularity. Their behavior is far from simple. They can be
delightful features of city districts, and economic assets to their
surroundings as well, but pitifully few are. They can grow more beloved
and valuable with the years, but pitifully few show this staying power.
For every Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia, or Rockefeller Plaza or
Washington Square in New York, or Boston Common, or their loved
equivalents in other cities, there are dozens of dispirited city vacuums
called parks, []{#calibre_link-711 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="90"}eaten around with decay, little used, unloved. As a woman in
Indiana said when asked if she liked the town square, "Nobody there but
dirty old men who spit tobacco juice and try to look up your skirt."

In orthodox city planning, neighborhood open spaces are venerated in an
amazingly uncritical fashion, much as savages venerate magical fetishes.
Ask a houser how his planned neighborhood improves on the old city and
he will cite, as a self-evident virtue, More Open Space. Ask a zoner
about the improvements in progressive codes and he will cite, again as a
self-evident virtue, their incentives toward leaving More Open Space.
Walk with a planner through a dispirited neighborhood and though it be
already scabby with deserted parks and tired landscaping festooned with
old Kleenex, he will envision a future of More Open Space.

More Open Space for what? For muggings? For bleak vacuums between
buildings? Or for ordinary people to use and enjoy? But people do not
use city open space just because it is there and because city planners
or designers wish they would.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-53){#calibre_link-59
.calibre7}

In certain specifics of its behavior, every city park is a case unto
itself and defies generalizations. Moreover, large parks such as
Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, Central Park and Bronx Park and Prospect
Park in New York, Forest Park in St. Louis, Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco, Grant Park in Chicago---and even smaller Boston
Common---differ much within themselves from part to part, and they also
receive differing influences from the different parts of their cities
which they touch. Some of the factors in the behavior of large
metropolitan parks are too complex to deal with in the first part of
this book; they will be discussed later, in [Chapter
Fourteen](#calibre_link-25){.calibre7}, The Curse of Border Vacuums.

Nevertheless, even though it is misleading to consider any two city
parks actual or potential duplicates of one another, or to believe that
generalizations can thoroughly explain all the peculiarities of any
single park, it is possible to generalize about a few
[]{#calibre_link-716 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="91"}basic
principles that deeply affect virtually all neighborhood parks.
Moreover, understanding these principles helps somewhat in understanding
influences working on city parks of all kinds---from little outdoor
lobbies which serve as enlargements of the street, to large parks with
major metropolitan attractions like zoos, lakes, woods, museums.

The reason neighborhood parks reveal certain general principles about
park behavior more clearly than specialized parks do is precisely that
neighborhood parks are the most generalized form of city park that we
possess. They are typically intended for general bread-and-butter use as
local public yards---whether the locality is predominately a working
place, predominately a residential place, or a thoroughgoing mixture.
Most city squares fall into this category of generalized public-yard
use; so does most project land; and so does much city parkland that
takes advantage of natural features like river banks or hilltops.

The first necessity in understanding how cities and their parks
influence each other is to jettison confusion between real uses and
mythical uses---for example, the science-fiction nonsense that parks are
"the lungs of the *city*." It takes about three acres of woods to absorb
as much carbon dioxide as four people exude in breathing, cooking and
heating. The oceans of air circulating about us, not parks, keep cities
from suffocating.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-54){#calibre_link-60 .calibre7}

Nor is more air let into the city by a given acreage of greenery
[]{#calibre_link-720 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="92"}than by an
equivalent acreage of streets. Subtracting streets and adding their
square footage to parks or project malls is irrelevant to the quantities
of fresh air a city receives. Air knows nothing of grass fetishes and
fails to pick and choose for itself in accordance with them.

It is necessary too, in understanding park behavior, to junk the false
reassurance that parks are real estate stabilizers or community anchors.
Parks are not automatically anything, and least of all are these
volatile elements stabilizers of values or of their neighborhoods and
districts.

Philadelphia affords almost a controlled experiment on this point. When
Penn laid out the city, he placed at its center the square now occupied
by City Hall, and at equal distances from this center he placed four
residential squares. What has become of these four, all the same age,
the same size, the same original use, and as nearly the same in presumed
advantages of location as they could be made?

Their fates are wildly different.

The best known of Penn's four squares is Rittenhouse Square, a beloved,
successful, much-used park, one of Philadelphia's greatest assets today,
the center of a fashionable neighborhood---indeed, the only old
neighborhood in Philadelphia which is spontaneously rehabilitating its
edges and extending its real estate values.

The second of Penn's little parks is Franklin Square, the city's Skid
Row park where the homeless, the unemployed and the people of indigent
leisure gather amid the adjacent flophouses, cheap hotels, missions,
second-hand clothing stores, reading and writing lobbies, pawnshops,
employment agencies, tattoo parlors, burlesque houses and eateries. This
park and its users are both seedy, but it is not a dangerous or crime
park. Nevertheless, it has hardly worked as an anchor to real estate
values or to social stability. Its neighborhood is scheduled for
large-scale clearance.

The third is Washington Square, the center of an area that was at one
time the heart of downtown, but is now specialized as a massive office
center---insurance companies, publishing, advertising. Several decades
ago Washington Square became Philadelphia's pervert park, to the point
where it was shunned by office []{#calibre_link-727 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="93"}lunchers and was an unmanageable vice and
crime problem to park workers and police. In the mid-1950's it was torn
up, closed for more than a year, and redesigned. In the process its
users were dispersed, which was the intent. Today it gets brief and
desultory use, lying mostly empty except at lunchtime on fine days.
Washington Square's district, like Franklin Square's, has failed at
spontaneously maintaining its values, let alone raising them. Beyond the
rim of offices, it is today designated for large-scale urban renewal.

The fourth of Penn's squares has been whittled to a small traffic
island, Logan Circle, in Benjamin Franklin Boulevard, an example of City
Beautiful planning. The circle is adorned with a great soaring fountain
and beautifully maintained planting. Although it is discouraging to
reach on foot, and is mainly an elegant amenity for those speeding by,
it gets a trickle of population on fine days. The district immediately
adjoining the monumental cultural center of which it is a part decayed
terribly and has already been slum-cleared and converted to Radiant
City.

The varying fates of these squares---especially the three that remain
squares---illustrate the volatile behavior that is characteristic of
city parks. These squares also happen to illustrate much about basic
principles of park behavior, and I shall return to them and their
lessons soon.

The fickle behavior of parks and their neighborhoods can be extreme. One
of the most charming and individual small parks to be found in any
American city, the Plaza in Los Angeles, ringed with immense magnolia
trees, a lovely place of shade and history is today incongruously
encircled on three sides with abandoned ghost buildings and with squalor
so miserable the stink of it rolls over the sidewalks. (Off the fourth
side is a Mexican tourist bazaar, doing fine.) Madison Park in Boston,
the residential grassy square of a row-house neighborhood, a park
precisely of the kind that is popping into many of today's sophisticated
redevelopment plans, is the center of a neighborhood that appears to
have been bombed. The houses around it---inherently no different from
those in high demand at outer reaches of Philadelphia's Rittenhouse
Square neighborhood---are crumbling from lack of value, with consequent
neglect. As one house in a row cracks, it is demolished
[]{#calibre_link-731 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="94"}and the
family in the next house is moved for safety; a few months later that
one goes and the house beyond is emptied. No plan is involved in this,
merely purposeless, gaping holes, rubble and abandonment, with the
little ghost park, theoretically a good residential anchorage, at the
center of the havoc. Federal Hill in Baltimore is a most beautiful and
serene park and affords the finest view in Baltimore of the city and the
bay, Its neighborhood, although decent, is moribund like the park
itself. For generations it has failed to attract newcomers by choice.
One of the bitterest disappointments in housing project history is the
failure of the parks and open grounds in these establishments to
increase adjacent values or to stabilize, let alone improve, their
neighborhoods. Notice the rim of any city park, civic plaza or project
parkland: how rare is the city open space with a rim that consistently
reflects the supposed magnetism or stabilizing influence residing in
parks.

And consider also the parks that go to waste most of the time, just as
Baltimore's beautiful Federal Hill does. In Cincinnati's two finest
parks, overlooking the river, I was able to find on a splendid, hot
September afternoon a grand total of five users (three teen-age girls
and one young couple); meanwhile, street after street in Cincinnati was
swarming with people at leisure who lacked the slightest amenity for
enjoying the city or the least kindness of shade. On a similar
afternoon, with the temperature above ninety degrees, I was able to find
in Corlears Hook park, a landscaped breezy river-front oasis in
Manhattan's heavily populated Lower East Side, just eighteen people,
most of them lone, apparently indigent,
men.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-55){#calibre_link-61 .calibre7} The children
were not there; no mother in her right mind would send a child in there
alone, and the mothers of the Lower East Side are not out of their
minds. A boat trip around Manhattan conveys the erroneous impression
that here is a city composed largely of parkland---and almost de-void
[]{#calibre_link-733 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="95"}of
inhabitants. Why are there so often no people where the parks are and no
parks where the people are?

Unpopular parks are troubling not only because of the waste and missed
opportunities they imply, but also because of their frequent negative
effects. They have the same problems as streets without eyes, and their
dangers spill over into the areas surrounding, so that streets along
such parks become known as danger places too and are avoided.

Moreover, underused parks and their equipment suffer from vandalism,
which is quite a different matter from wear. This fact was obliquely
recognized by Stuart Constable, Executive Officer, at the time, of New
York City's park department, when he was asked by the press what he
thought of a London proposal to install television in parks. After
explaining that he did not think television a suitable park use,
Constable added, "I don't think \[the sets\] would last half an hour
before they disappeared."

Every fine summer night, television sets can be seen outdoors, used
publicly, on the busy old sidewalks of East Harlem. Each machine, its
extension cord run along the sidewalk from some store's electric outlet,
is the informal headquarters spot of a dozen or so men who divide their
attention among the machine, the children they are in charge of, their
cans of beer, each others' comments and the greetings of passers-by.
Strangers stop, as they wish, to join the viewing. Nobody is concerned
about peril to the machines. Yet Constable's skepticism about their
safety in the Parks Department's territories was amply justified. There
speaks a man of experience who has presided over many, many unpopular,
dangerous and ill-used parks, along with a few good ones.

Too much is expected of city parks. Far from transforming any essential
quality in their surroundings, far from automatically uplifting their
neighborhoods, neighborhood parks themselves are directly and
drastically affected by the way the neighborhood acts upon them.

::: {#calibre_link-738 .section_break}

:::

Cities are thoroughly physical places. In seeking understanding of their
behavior, we get useful information by observing what
[]{#calibre_link-740 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="96"}occurs
tangibly and physically, instead of sailing off on metaphysical fancies.
Penn's three squares in Philadelphia are three ordinary,
bread-and-butter types of city parks. Let us see what they tell us about
their ordinary physical interactions with their neighborhoods.

Rittenhouse Square, the success, possesses a diverse rim and diverse
neighborhood hinterland. Immediately on its edges it has in sequence, as
this is written, an art club with restaurant and galleries, a music
school, an Army office building, an apartment house, a club, an old
apothecary shop, a Navy office building which used to be a hotel,
apartments, a church, a parochial school, apartments, a public-library
branch, apartments, a vacant site where town houses have been torn down
for prospective apartments, a cultural society, apartments, a vacant
site where a town house is planned, another town house, apartments.
Immediately beyond the rim, in the streets leading off at right angles
and in the next streets parallel to the park sides, is an abundance of
shops and services of all sorts with old houses or newer apartments
above, mingled with a variety of offices.

Does anything about this physical arrangement of the neighborhood affect
the park physically? Yes. This mixture of uses of buildings directly
produces for the park a mixture of users who enter and leave the park at
different times. They use the park at different times from one another
because their daily schedules differ. The park thus possesses an
intricate sequence of uses and users.

Joseph Guess, a Philadelphia newspaperman who lives at Rittenhouse
Square and has amused himself by watching its ballet, says it has this
sequence: "First, a few early-bird walkers who live beside the park take
brisk strolls. They are shortly joined, and followed, by residents who
cross the park on their way to work out of the district. Next come
people from outside the district, crossing the park on their way to work
within the neighborhood. Soon after these people have left the square
the errand-goers start to come through, many of them lingering, and in
mid-morning mothers and small children come in, along with an increasing
number of shoppers. Before noon the mothers and children leave, but the
square's population continues to grow []{#calibre_link-744 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="97"}because of employees on their lunch hour and
also because of people coming from elsewhere to lunch at the art club
and the other restaurants around. In the afternoon mothers and children
turn up again, the shoppers and errand-goers linger longer, and school
children eventually add themselves in. In the later afternoon the
mothers have left but the homeward-bound workers come through---first
those leaving the neighborhood, and then those returning to it. Some of
these linger. From then on into the evening the square gets many young
people on dates, some who are dining out nearby, some who live nearby,
some who seem to come just because of the nice combination of liveliness
and leisure. All through the day, there is a sprinkling of old people
with time on their hands, some people who are indigent, and various
unidentified idlers."

In short, Rittenhouse Square is busy fairly continuously for the same
basic reasons that a lively sidewalk is used continuously: because of
functional physical diversity among adjacent uses, and hence diversity
among users and their schedules.

Philadelphia's Washington Square---the one that became a pervert
park---affords an extreme contrast in this respect. Its rim is dominated
by huge office buildings, and both this rim and its immediate hinterland
lack any equivalent to the diversity of Rittenhouse Square---services,
restaurants, cultural facilities. The neighborhood hinterland possesses
a low density of dwellings. Washington Square thus has had in recent
decades only one significant reservoir of potential local users: the
office workers.

Does anything about this fact affect the park physically? Yes. This
principal reservoir of users all operate on much the same daily time
schedule. They all enter the district at once. They are then
incarcerated all morning until lunch, and incarcerated again after
lunch. They are absent after working hours. Therefore, Washington
Square, of necessity, is a vacuum most of the day and evening. Into it
came what usually fills city vacuums---a form of blight.

Here it is necessary to take issue with a common belief about
cities---the belief that uses of low status drive out uses of high
status. This is not how cities behave, and the belief that it is (Fight
Blight!) renders futile much energy aimed at attacking
[]{#calibre_link-749 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="98"}symptoms and
ignoring causes. People or uses with more money at their command, or
greater respectability (in a credit society the two often go together),
can fairly easily supplant those less prosperous or of less status, and
commonly do so in city neighborhoods that achieve popularity. The
reverse seldom happens. People or uses with less money at their command,
less choice or less open respectability move into already weakened areas
of cities, neighborhoods that are no longer coveted by people with the
luxury of choice, or neighborhoods that can draw for financing only upon
hot money, exploitative money and loan-shark money. The newcomers
thereupon must try to make do with something which, for one reason or
another, or more typically for a complexity of reasons, has already
failed to sustain popularity. Overcrowding, deterioration, crime, and
other forms of blight are surface symptoms of prior and deeper economic
and functional failure of the district.

The perverts who completely took over Philadelphia's Washington Square
for several decades were a manifestation of this city behavior, in
microcosm. They did not kill off a vital and appreciated park. They did
not drive out respectable users. They moved into an abandoned place and
entrenched themselves. As this is written, the unwelcome users have
successfully been chased away to find other vacuums, but this act has
still not supplied the park with a sufficient sequence of welcome users.

Far in the past, Washington Square did have a good population of users.
But although it is still the "same" park, its use and essence changed
completely when its surroundings changed. Like all neighborhood parks,
it is the creature of its surroundings *and of the way its surroundings
generate mutual support from diverse uses, or fail to generate such
support*.

It need not have been office work that depopulated this park. Any
single, overwhelmingly dominant use imposing a limited schedule of users
would have had a similar effect. The same basic situation occurs in
parks where residence is the overwhelmingly dominant neighborhood use.
In this case, the single big daily potential reservoir of adult users is
mothers. City parks or playgrounds cannot be continuously populated by
mothers alone, any more than by office workers alone. Mothers, using a
park in their []{#calibre_link-753 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="99"}own relatively simple sequences, can populate it
significantly for about a maximum of five hours, roughly two hours in
the morning and three in the afternoon, and that only if they comprise a
mixture of classes.[\*^4^](#calibre_link-56){#calibre_link-62 .calibre7}
Mothers' daily tenure of parks is not only relatively brief but is
circumscribed in choice of time by meals, housework, children's naps
and, very sensitively, by weather.

A generalized neighborhood park that is stuck with functional monotony
of surroundings in any form is inexorably a vacuum for a significant
part of the day. And here a vicious circle takes over. Even if the
vacuum is protected against various forms of blight, it exerts little
attraction for its limited potential reservoir of users. It comes to
bore them dreadfully, for moribundity is boring. In cities, liveliness
and variety attract more liveliness; deadness and monotony repel life.
And this is a principle vital not only to the ways cities behave
socially, but also to the ways they behave economically.

There is, however, one important exception to the rule that it takes a
wide functional mixture of users to populate and enliven a neighborhood
park through the day. There is one group in cities which, all by itself,
can enjoy and populate a park long and well---although it seldom draws
other types of users. This is the group of people with total leisure,
the people who lack even the responsibilities of home, and in
Philadelphia these are the people of Penn's third park, Franklin Square,
the Skid Row park.

There is much distaste for Skid Row parks, which is natural because
human failure in such undiluted doses is hard to swallow. Customarily,
too, little distinction is drawn between these and criminal parks,
although they are quite different. (With time, of course, one may become
the other, just as in the case of Franklin Square, an originally
residential park that eventually turned into a Skid Row park after the
park and its neighborhood had lost their appeal to people with choice.)

A good Skid Row park like Franklin Square has something to
[]{#calibre_link-758 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="100"}be said for
it. Supply and demand have come together for once, and the accident is
clearly appreciated among those who have been disinherited by themselves
or circumstance. In Franklin Square, if the weather permits, a day-long
outdoor reception holds sway. The benches at the center of the reception
are filled, with a voluble standing overflow milling about.
Conversational groups continually form and dissolve into one another.
The guests behave respectfully to one another and are courteous to
interlopers too. Almost imperceptibly, like the hand of a clock, this
raggle-taggle reception creeps around the circular pool at the center of
the square. And indeed, it is the hand of a clock, for it is following
the sun, staying in the warmth. When the sun goes down the clock stops;
the reception is over until
tomorrow.[\*^5^](#calibre_link-57){#calibre_link-63 .calibre7}

Not all cities have well-developed Skid Row parks. New York lacks one,
for example, although it has many small park fragments and playgrounds
used primarily by bums, and the vicious Sara Delano Roosevelt park gets
a lot of bums. Possibly America's biggest Skid Row park---its population
vast compared with Franklin Square---is the main downtown park of Los
Angeles, Pershing Square. This tells us something interesting about its
surroundings too. So spattered and decentralized are the central
functions of Los Angeles that the only element of its downtown that has
full metropolitan dimensions and intensity is that of the leisured
indigent. Pershing Square is more like a forum than a reception, a forum
composed of scores of panel discussions, each with its leading
monologist or moderator. The confabs extend all around the periphery of
the square, where the benches and walls are, and rise to crescendos at
the corners. Some benches are stenciled "Reserved for Ladies" and this
nicety is observed. Los Angeles is fortunate that the vacuum of a
disintegrated downtown has not been appropriated by predators but has
been relatively respectably populated by a flourishing Skid Row.

But We can hardly count on polite Skid Rows to save all the unpopular
parks of our cities. A generalized neighborhood park
[]{#calibre_link-761 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="101"}that is not
headquarters for the leisured indigent can become populated naturally
and casually only by being situated very close indeed to where active
and different currents of life and function come to a focus. If
downtown, it must get shoppers, visitors and strollers as well as
downtown workers. If not downtown, it must still be where life
swirls---where there is work, cultural, residential and commercial
activity---as much as possible of everything different that cities can
offer. The main problem of neighborhood park planning boils down to the
problem of nurturing diversified neighborhoods capable of using and
supporting parks.

However, many city districts do already possess precisely such ignored
focal points of life which cry out for close-by neighborhood parks or
public squares. It is easy to identify such centers of district life and
activity, because they are where people with leaflets to hand out choose
to work (if permitted by the police).

But there is no point in bringing parks to where the people are, if in
the process the *reasons* that the people are there are wiped out and
the park *substituted* for them. This is one of the basic errors in
housing-project and civic- and cultural-center design. Neighborhood
parks fail to substitute in any way for plentiful city diversity. Those
that are successful never serve as barriers or as interruptions to the
intricate functioning of the city around them. Rather, they help to knit
together diverse surrounding functions by giving them a pleasant joint
facility; in the process they add another appreciated element to the
diversity and give something back to their surroundings, as Rittenhouse
Square or any other good park gives back.

You can neither lie to a neighborhood park, nor reason with it.
"Artist's conceptions" and persuasive renderings can put *pictures* of
life into proposed neighborhood parks or park malls, and verbal
rationalizations can conjure up users who ought to appreciate them, but
in real life only diverse surroundings have the practical power of
inducing a natural, continuing flow of life and use. Superficial
architectural variety may look like diversity, but only a genuine
content of economic and social diversity, resulting in people with
different schedules, has meaning to the park and the power to confer the
boon of life upon it.

[]{#calibre_link-766 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="102"}Given good
location, a bread-and-butter neighborhood park can make much of its
assets, but it can also fritter them away. It is obvious that a place
that looks like a jail yard will neither attract users nor reciprocate
with its surroundings in the same fashion as a place that looks like an
oasis. But there are all kinds of oases too, and some of their salient
characteristics for success are not so obvious.

Outstandingly successful neighborhood parks seldom have much competition
from other open spaces. This is understandable, because people in
cities, with all their other interests and duties, can hardly enliven
unlimited amounts of local, generalized park. City people would have to
devote themselves to park use as if it were a business (or as the
leisured indigent do) to justify, for example, the plethora of malls,
promenades, playgrounds, parks and indeterminate land oozes afforded in
typical Radiant Garden City schemes, and enforced in official urban
rebuilding by stringent requirements that high percentages of land be
left open.

We can already see that city districts with relatively large amounts of
generalized park, like Morningside Heights or Harlem in New York, seldom
develop intense community focus on a park and intense love for it, such
as the people of Boston's North End have for their little Prado or the
people of Greenwich Village have for Washington Square, or the people of
the Rittenhouse Square district have for their park. Greatly loved
neighborhood parks benefit from a certain rarity value.

The ability of a neighborhood park to stimulate passionate attachment
or, conversely, only apathy, seems to have little or nothing to do with
the incomes or occupations of a population in a district. This is an
inference which can be drawn from the widely differing income,
occupational and cultural groups who are simultaneously deeply attached
to a park like New York's Washington Square. The relationship of
differing income classes to given parks can also sometimes be observed
in sequence over time, either positively or negatively. Over the years,
the economic condition of people in Boston's North End has risen
appreciably. Both in time of poverty and in time of prosperity, the
Prado, a minute but central park, has been the heart of the
neighborhood. []{#calibre_link-770 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="103"}Harlem in New York affords an illustration of consistent
reverse behavior. Over the course of years Harlem has changed from a
fashionable upper-middle-class residential district, to a
lower-middle-class district, to a district predominantly of the poor and
the discriminated against. During all this sequence of different
populations, Harlem, with a wealth of local parks as compared to
Greenwich Village, for example, has never seen a period in which one of
its parks was a vital focus of community life and identity. The same sad
observation can be made of Morningside Heights. And it is also true
typically of project grounds, even including those carefully designed.

This inability of a neighborhood or district to attach itself with
affection---and with the immense resulting power of symbolism---to a
neighborhood park is due, I think, to a combination of negative factors:
first, parks that are possible candidates are handicapped because of
insufficient diversity in their immediate surroundings, and consequent
dullness; and second, what diversity and life are available are
dispersed and dissipated among too many different parks, too similar in
purpose to each other.

Certain qualities in design can apparently make a difference too. For if
the object of a generalized bread-and-butter neighborhood park is to
attract as many different kinds of people, with as many different
schedules, interests, and purposes as possible, it is clear that the
design of the park should abet this generalization of patronage rather
than work at cross-purposes to it. Parks intensely used in generalized
public-yard fashion tend to have four elements in their design which I
shall call intricacy, centering, sun and enclosure.

Intricacy is related to the variety of reasons for which people come to
neighborhood parks. Even the same person comes for different reasons at
different times; sometimes to sit tiredly, sometimes to play or to watch
a game, sometimes to read or work, sometimes to show off, sometimes to
fall in love, sometimes to keep an appointment, sometimes to savor the
hustle of the city from a retreat, sometimes in the hope of finding
acquaintances, sometimes to get closer to a bit of nature, sometimes to
keep a child occupied, sometimes simply to see what offers, and almost
always to be entertained by the sight of other people.

[]{#calibre_link-775 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="104"}If the whole
thing can be absorbed in a glance, like a good poster, and if every
place looks like every other place in the park and also feels like every
other place when you try it, the park affords little stimulation to all
these differing uses and moods. Nor is there much reason to return to it
again and again.

An intelligent and able woman who lives beside Rittenhouse Square
remarks, "I've used it almost every day for fifteen years, but the other
night I tried to draw a plan of it from memory and couldn't. It was too
complicated for me." The same phenomenon is true of Washington Square in
New York. In the course of a community battle to protect it from a
highway, the strategists frequently tried to sketch the park roughly
during meetings, to illustrate a point. Very difficult.

Yet neither of these parks is so complex in plan as all that. Intricacy
that counts is mainly intricacy at eye level, change in the rise of
ground, groupings of trees, openings leading to various focal
points---in short, subtle expressions of difference. The subtle
differences in setting are then exaggerated by the differences in use
that grow up among them. Successful parks always look much more
intricate in use than when they are empty.

Even very small squares that are successful often get ingenious
variation into the stage sets they provide for their users. Rockefeller
Center does it by making drama out of four changes in level. Union
Square in downtown San Francisco has a plan that looks deadly dull on
paper or from a high building; but it is bent onto such changes in
ground level, like Dali's painting of the wet watches, that it appears
remarkably various. (This is, of course, exactly the transformation that
happens, on a larger scale, to San Francisco's straight, regular
gridiron street patterns as they tumble up and down the hills.) Paper
plans of squares and parks are deceptive---sometimes they are crammed
full of apparent differences that mean almost nothing because they are
all below eye level, or are discounted by the eye because they are too
often repeated.

Probably the most important element in intricacy is centering. Good
small parks typically have a place somewhere within them commonly
understood to be the center---at the very least a main crossroads and
pausing point, a climax. Some small parks or []{#calibre_link-780
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="105"}squares are virtually all center,
and get their intricacy from minor differences at their peripheries.

People try hard to create centers and climaxes to a park, even against
odds. Sometimes it is impossible. Long strip parks, like the dismally
unsuccessful Sara Delano Roosevelt park in New York and many riverside
parks, are frequently designed as if they were rolled out from a die
stamper. Sara Delano Roosevelt park has four identical brick
"recreation" barracks stamped along it at intervals. What can users make
of this? The more they move back and forth, the more they are in the
same place. It is like a trudge on a treadmill. This too is a common
failing in project design, and almost unavoidable there, because most
projects are essentially die-stamped design for die-stamped functions.

People can be inventive in their use of park centers. The fountain basin
in New York's Washington Square is used inventively and exuberantly.
Once, beyond memory, the basin possessed an ornamental iron centerpiece
with a fountain. What remains is the sunken concrete circular basin, dry
most of the year, bordered with four steps ascending to a stone coping
that forms an outer rim a few feet above ground level. In effect, this
is a circular arena, a theater in the round, and that is how it is used,
with complete confusion as to who are spectators and who are the show.
Everybody is both, although some are more so: guitar players, singers,
crowds of darting children, impromptu dancers, sunbathers, conversers,
show-offs, photographers, tourists, and mixed in with them all a
bewildering sprinkling of absorbed readers---not there for lack of
choice, because quiet benches to the east are half-deserted.

The city officials regularly concoct improvement schemes by which this
center within the park would be sown to grass and flowers and surrounded
by a fence. The invariable phrase used to describe this is, "restoring
the land to park use."

That is a different form of park use, legitimate in places. But for
neighborhood parks, the finest centers are stage settings for people.

Sun is part of a park's setting for people, shaded, to be sure, in
summer. A high building effectively cutting the sun angle across the
south side of a park can kill off a lot of it. Rittenhouse Square,
[]{#calibre_link-786 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="106"}for all its
virtues, has this misfortune. On a good October afternoon, for example,
almost a third of the square lies completely empty; the great building
shadow across it from a new apartment house is a great eraser of human
beings within its pall.

Although buildings should not cut sun from a park---if the object is to
encourage full use---the presence of buildings around a park is
important in design. They enclose it. They make a definite shape out of
the space, so that it appears as an important event in the city scene, a
positive feature, rather than a no-account leftover. Far from being
attracted by indefinite leftovers of land oozing around buildings,
people behave as if repelled by them. They even cross streets as they
meet up with them, a phenomenon that can be watched wherever a housing
project, for example, breaks into a busy street. Richard Nelson, a
Chicago real estate analyst who watches the behavior of people in cities
as a clue to economic values, reports, "On a warm September afternoon,
Mellon Square in downtown Pittsburgh contained too many users to count.
But that same afternoon, during a period of two hours, only three
people---one old lady knitting, one bum, one unidentifiable character
asleep with a newspaper over his face---used the park of the downtown
Gateway Center."

Gateway Center is a Radiant City office and hotel project with the
buildings set here and there in empty land. It lacks the degree of
diversity of Mellon Square's surroundings, but its diversity is not low
enough to account for only four users (counting Nelson himself) during
the heart of a good afternoon. City park users simply do not seek
settings for buildings; they seek settings for themselves. To them,
parks are foreground, buildings background, rather than the reverse.

Cities are full of generalized parks that can hardly be expected to
justify themselves, even if their districts are successfully enlivened.
This is because some parks are basically unfitted, whether by location,
size or shape, to serve successfully in the public-yard fashion I have
been discussing. Nor are they fitted by size or inherent variety of
scene to become major metropolitan parks. What can be done with them?

Some of these, if sufficiently small, can do another job well:
[]{#calibre_link-792 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="107"}simply
pleasing the eye. San Francisco is good at this. A tiny triangular
street intersection leftover, which in most cities would either be
flattened into asphalt or else have a hedge, a few benches and be a
dusty nonentity, in San Francisco is a fenced miniature world of its
own, a deep, cool world of water and exotic forest, populated by the
birds that have been attracted. You cannot go in yourself. You do not
need to, because your eyes go in and take you farther into this world
than feet could ever go. San Francisco gives an impression of much
verdure and relief from city stoniness. Yet San Francisco is a crowded
city and little ground is used to convey this impression. The effect
arises mainly from small bits of intensive cultivation, and it is
multiplied because so much of San Francisco's greenery is
vertical---window boxes, trees, vines, thick ground cover on little
patches of "waste" slopes.

Gramercy Park in New York overcomes an awkward situation by pleasing the
eye. This park happens to be a fenced private yard in a public place;
the property goes with the residential buildings across the surrounding
streets. It must be entered with a key. Since it is blessed with
splendid trees, excellent maintenance and an air of glamor, it
successfully provides for the passing public a place to please the eye,
and so far as the public is concerned this is its justification.

But parks primarily to please the eye, uncombined with other uses, are
by definition where eyes will see them; and again by definition they are
best small because to do their job well they must do it beautifully and
intensively, not perfunctorily.

The worst problem parks are located precisely where people do not pass
by and likely never will. A city park in this fix, afflicted (for in
such cases it is an affliction) with a good-sized terrain, is
figuratively in the same position as a large store in a bad economic
location. If such a store can be rescued and justified, it will be by
dint of heavy concentration on what merchants call "demand goods"
instead of reliance on "impulse sales." If the demand goods do bring
enough customers, a certain gravy from impulse sales may follow.

From the standpoint of a park, what is demand goods?

We can get some hints by looking at a few such problem parks. Jefferson
Park in East Harlem is an example. It consists of []{#calibre_link-798
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="108"}a number of parts, the ostensibly
principal one intended for general neighborhood use---equivalent to
impulse sales in merchandising vocabulary. But everything about it
thwarts this purpose. Its location is at the far edge of its community,
bounded on one side by the river. It is further isolated by a wide,
heavy traffic street. Its internal planning runs largely to long,
isolated walks without effective centers. To an outsider it looks
weirdly deserted; to insiders, it is a focus of neighborhood conflict,
violence and fear. Since a brutal evening murder of a visitor by
teen-agers in 1958, it has been more than ever shunned and avoided.

However, among Jefferson Park's several separate sections, one does
redeem itself handsomely. This is a big outdoor swimming pool, obviously
not big enough. Sometimes it contains more people than water.

Consider Corlears Hook, the portion of the East River parklands where I
could find only eighteen people amid the lawns and benches on a good
day. Corlears Hook possesses, off to a side, a ball field, nothing
special, and yet on that same day most of the park's life, such as it
was, was in the ball field. Corlears Hook also contains, among its
meaningless acres of lawns, a band shell. Six times a year, on summer
evenings, thousands of people from the Lower East Side pour into the
park to hear a concert series. For a total of some eighteen hours in the
year, Corlears Hook park comes alive and is vastly enjoyed.

Here we see demand goods operating, although obviously too limited in
quantity and too desultory in time. It is clear, however, that people do
come to these parks for certain special demand goods, although they
simply do not come for generalized or impulse park use. In short, if a
generalized city park cannot be supported by uses arising from natural,
nearby intense diversity, it must convert from a generalized park to a
specialized park. Effective diversity of use, drawing deliberately a
sequence of diversified users, must be deliberately introduced into the
park itself.

Only experience and trial and error can indicate what diverse
combinations of activities can operate effectively as demand goods for
any specific problem park. But we can make some useful generalized
guesses about components. First, a negative generalization: Magnificent
views and handsome landscaping fail to operate []{#calibre_link-803
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="109"}as demand goods; maybe these
"should," but demonstrably they do not. They can work as adjuncts only.

On the other hand, swimming operates as demand goods. So does fishing,
especially if there is bait buying and boating along with it. Sports
fields do. So do carnivals, or carnival-like
activities.[\*^6^](#calibre_link-58){#calibre_link-64 .calibre7}

::: {#calibre_link-805 .section_break}
---
:::

Music (including recorded music) and plays also serve as demand goods.
It is curious that relatively little is done with these in parks,
because the casual introduction of cultural life is part of the historic
mission of cities. It is a mission that can still operate full force, as
the *New Yorker* indicated in this comment on the free Shakespeare
season of 1958 in Central Park:

> The ambiance, the weather, the color and lights, and simple curiosity
> brought them out; some had never seen any sort of play in the flesh.
> Hundreds came back again and again; a fellow we know says he met a

This suggests, for one thing, that universities with drama departments
(and, so often, with dead, problem parks in their vicinities) might try
putting two and two together, rather than cultivating hostile policies
of defended Turf. Columbia University in New York is taking a
constructive step by planning sports facilities---for both the
university and the neighborhood---in Morningside Park, which has been
shunned and feared for decades. []{#calibre_link-809 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="110"}Adding a few other activities too, like
music or shows, could convert a dreadful neighborhood liability into an
outstanding neighborhood asset.

Cities lack minor park activities that could serve as minor "demand
goods." Some are discoverable by observation of what people try to do if
they can get away with it. For instance, the manager of a shopping
center near Montreal found his ornamental pool mysteriously filthy every
morning. Spying after closing hours he found that children were sneaking
in and washing and polishing their bikes there. Places to wash bikes
(where people have bikes), places to hire and to ride bikes, places to
dig in the ground, places to build ramshackle wigwams and huts out of
old lumber, are activities usually crowded out of cities. The Puerto
Ricans who come to our cities today have no place to roast pigs outdoors
unless they can find a private yard for the purpose, but outdoor pig
roasts and the parties that follow can be as much fun as the Italian
street festivals many city dwellers have learned to love. Kite flying is
a minor activity but there are those who love it, and it suggests
kite-flying places where materials for making kites are sold too, and
where there are terraces on which to work at them. Ice skating used to
be enjoyed on many ponds within northern cities until it was crowded
out. Fifth Avenue in New York used to have five fashionable skating
ponds between Thirty-first and Ninety-eighth streets, one only four
blocks from the present rink at Rockefeller Plaza. Artificial rinks have
permitted the rediscovery of city ice skating in our time, and in cities
at the latitudes of New York, Cleveland, Detroit and Chicago artificial
rinks extend the skating season to include almost half the year. Every
city district could probably enjoy and use an outdoor park ice rink if
it had one, and provide a population of entranced watchers too. Indeed,
relatively small rinks placed at more numerous locations are much more
civilized and pleasant than huge centralized rinks.

All this takes money. But American cities today, under the illusions
that open land is an automatic good and that quantity is equivalent to
quality, are instead frittering away money on parks, playgrounds and
project land-oozes too large, too frequent, too []{#calibre_link-812
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="111"}perfunctory, too ill-located, and
hence too dull or too inconvenient to be used.

City parks are not abstractions, or automatic repositories of virtue or
uplift, any more than sidewalks are abstractions. They mean nothing
divorced from their practical, tangible uses, and hence they mean
nothing divorced from the tangible effects on them---for good or for
ill---of the city districts and uses touching them.

Generalized parks can and do add great attraction to neighborhoods that
people find attractive for a great variety of other uses. They further
depress neighborhoods that people find unattractive for a wide variety
of other uses, for they exaggerate the dullness, the danger, the
emptiness. The more successfully a city mingles everyday diversity of
uses and users in its everyday streets, the more successfully, casually
(and economically) its people thereby enliven and support well-located
parks that can thus give back grace and delight to their neighborhoods
instead of vacuity.

[\*^2^](#calibre_link-60){.calibre7} Los Angeles, which needs lung help
more than any other American city, also happens to have more open space
than any other large city; its smog is partly owing to local
eccentricities of circulation in the ocean of air, but also partly to
the city's very scatter and amplitude of open space itself. The scatter
requires tremendous automobile travel and this in turn contributes
almost two-thirds of the chemicals to the city's smog stew. Of the
thousand tons of air-polluting chemicals released each day by Los
Angeles' three million registered vehicles, about 600 tons are
hydrocarbons, which may be largely eliminated eventually by requiring
exhaust after-burners on cars. But about 400 tons are oxides of
nitrogen, and, as this is written, research has not even been started on
devices for reducing this component of exhausts. The air and open land
paradox, and it is obviously not a temporary paradox, is this: in modern
cities generous scatters of open space promote air pollution instead of
combating it. This was an effect Ebenezer Howard could hardly have
foreseen. But foresight is no longer required; only hindsight.

passing city.

contacts with plenty of other people; (2) work, including even drudgery;
and (3) violent play. It is Menninger's belief that cities afford
disastrously little opportunity for violent play. The types he singled
out as having proved useful were active outdoor sports, bowling, and
shooting galleries like those found in carnivals and amusement parks but
only occasionally (Times Square, for instance) in cities.

# The uses of city neighborhoods {#calibre_link-820 .chaphead1}
:::

Neighborhood is a word that has come to sound like a Valentine. As a
sentimental concept, "neighborhood" is harmful to city planning. It
leads to attempts at warping city life into imitations of town or
suburban life. Sentimentality plays with sweet intentions in place of
good sense.

A successful city neighborhood is a place that keeps sufficiently
abreast of its problems so it is not destroyed by them. An unsuccessful
neighborhood is a place that is overwhelmed by its defects and problems
and is progressively more helpless before them. Our cities contain all
degrees of success and failure. But on the whole we Americans are poor
at handling city neighborhoods, as can be seen by the long accumulations
of failures in our great gray belts on the one hand, and by the Turfs of
rebuilt city on the other hand.

It is fashionable to suppose that certain touchstones of the good life
will create good neighborhoods---schools, parks, clean housing
[]{#calibre_link-824 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="113"}and the
like. How easy life would be if this were so! How charming to control a
complicated and ornery society by bestowing upon it rather simple
physical goodies. In real life, cause and effect are not so simple. Thus
a Pittsburgh study, undertaken to show the supposed clear correlation
between better housing and improved social conditions, compared
delinquency records in still uncleared slums to delinquency records in
new housing projects, and came to the embarrassing discovery that the
delinquency was higher in the improved housing. Does this mean improved
shelter increases delinquency? Not at all. It means other things may be
more important than housing, however, and it means also that there is no
direct, simple relationship between good housing and good behavior, a
fact which the whole tale of the Western world's history, the whole
collection of our literature, and the whole fund of observation open to
any of us should long since have made evident. Good shelter is a useful
good in itself, as shelter. When we try to justify good shelter instead
on the pretentious grounds that it will work social or family miracles
we fool ourselves. Reinhold Niebuhr has called this particular
self-deception, "The doctrine of salvation by bricks."

It is even the same with schools. Important as good schools are, they
prove totally undependable at rescuing bad neighborhoods and at creating
good neighborhoods. Nor does a good school building guarantee a good
education. Schools, like parks, are apt to be volatile creatures of
their neighborhoods (as well as being creatures of larger policy). In
bad neighborhoods, schools are brought to ruination, physically and
socially; while successful neighborhoods improve their schools by
fighting for them.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-65){#calibre_link-71 .calibre7}

Nor can we conclude, either, that middle-class families or upper-class
families build good neighborhoods, and poor families
[]{#calibre_link-827 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="114"}fail to. For
example, within the poverty of the North End in Boston, within the
poverty of the West Greenwich Village waterfront neighborhoods, within
the poverty of the slaughterhouse district in Chicago (three areas,
incidentally, that were all written off as hopeless by their cities'
planners), good neighborhoods were created: neighborhoods whose internal
problems have grown less with time instead of greater. Meantime, within
the once upper-class grace and serenity of Baltimore's beautiful Eutaw
Place, within the one-time upper-class solidity of Boston's South End,
within the culturally privileged purlieus of New York's Morningside
Heights, within miles upon miles of dull, respectable middle-class gray
area, bad neighborhoods were created, neighborhoods whose apathy and
internal failure grew greater with time instead of less.

To hunt for city neighborhood touchstones of success in high standards
of physical facilities, or in supposedly competent and nonproblem
populations, or in nostalgic memories of town life, is a waste of time.
It evades the meat of the question, which is the problem of what city
neighborhoods do, if anything, that may be socially and economically
useful in cities themselves, and how they do it.

We shall have something solid to chew on if we think of city
neighborhoods as mundane organs of self-government. Our failures with
city neighborhoods are, ultimately, failures in localized
self-government. And our successes are successes at localized
self-government. I am using self-government in its broadest sense,
meaning both the informal and formal self-management of society.

Both the demands on self-government and the techniques for it differ in
big cities from the demands and techniques in smaller places. For
instance, there is the problem of all those strangers. To think of city
neighborhoods as organs of city self-government or self-management, we
must first jettison some orthodox but irrelevant notions about
neighborhoods which may apply to communities in smaller settlements but
not in cities. We must first of all drop any ideal of neighborhoods as
self-contained or introverted units.

Unfortunately orthodox planning theory is deeply committed to
[]{#calibre_link-832 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="115"}the ideal of
supposedly cozy, inward-turned city neighborhoods. In its pure form, the
ideal is a neighborhood composed of about 7,000 persons, a unit
supposedly of sufficient size to populate an elementary school and to
support convenience shopping and a community center. This unit is then
further rationalized into smaller groupings of a size scaled to the play
and supposed management of children and the chitchat of housewives.
Although the "ideal" is seldom literally reproduced, it is the point of
departure for nearly all neighborhood renewal plans, for all project
building, for much modern zoning, and also for the practice work done by
today's architectural-planning students, who will be inflicting their
adaptations of it on cities tomorrow. In New York City alone, by 1959,
more than half a million people were already living in adaptations of
this vision of planned neighborhoods. This "ideal" of the city
neighborhood as an island, turned inward on itself, is an important
factor in our lives nowadays.

To see why it is a silly and even harmful "ideal" for cities, we must
recognize a basic difference between these concoctions grafted into
cities, and town life. In a town of 5,000 or 10,000 population, if you
go to Main Street (analogous to the consolidated commercial facilities
or community center for a planned neighborhood), you run into people you
also know at work, or went to school with, or see at church, or people
who are your children's teachers, or who have sold or given you
professional or artisan's services, or whom you know to be friends of
your casual acquaintances, or whom you know by reputation. Within the
limits of a town or village, the connections among its people keep
crossing and recrossing and this can make workable and essentially
cohesive communities out of even larger towns than those of 7,000
population, and to some extent out of little cities.

But a population of 5,000 or 10,000 residents in a big city has no such
innate degree of natural cross-connections within itself, except under
the most extraordinary circumstances. Nor can city neighborhood
planning, no matter how cozy in intent, change this fact. If it could,
the price would be destruction of a city by converting it into a parcel
of towns. As it is, the price of trying, and not even succeeding at a
misguided aim is conversion of a city into a parcel of mutually
suspicious and hostile Turfs. There []{#calibre_link-835 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="116"}are many other flaws in this "ideal" of the
planned neighborhood and its various adaptations.

Lately a few planners, notably Reginald Isaacs of Harvard, have daringly
begun to question whether the conception of neighborhood in big cities
has any meaning at all. Isaacs points out that city people are mobile.
They can and do pick and choose from the entire city (and beyond) for
everything from a job, a dentist, recreation, or friends, to shops,
entertainment, or even in some cases their children's schools. City
people, says Isaacs, are not stuck with the provincialism of a
neighborhood, and why should they be? Isn't wide choice and rich
opportunity the point of
cities?[\*^2^](#calibre_link-66){#calibre_link-72 .calibre7}

This is indeed the point of cities. Furthermore, this very fluidity of
use and choice among city people is precisely the foundation underlying
most city cultural activities and special enterprises of all kinds.
Because these can draw skills, materials, customers or clienteles from a
great pool, they can exist in extraordinary variety, and not only
downtown but in other city districts that develop specialties and
characters of their own. And in drawing upon the great pool of the city
in this way, city enterprises increase, in turn, the choices available
to city people for jobs, goods, entertainment, ideas, contacts,
services.

[]{#calibre_link-840 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="117"}Whatever
city neighborhoods may be, or may not be, and whatever usefulness they
may have, or may be coaxed into having, their qualities cannot work at
cross-purposes to thoroughgoing city mobility and fluidity of *use,*
without economically weakening the city of which they are a part. The
lack of either economic or social self-containment is natural and
necessary to city neighborhoods---simply because they are parts of
cities. Isaacs is right when he implies that the conception of
neighborhood in cities is meaningless---so long as we think of
neighborhoods as being self-contained units to any significant degree,
modeled upon town neighborhoods.

But for all the innate extroversion of city neighborhoods, it fails to
follow that city people can therefore get along magically without
neighborhoods. Even the most urbane citizen does care about the
atmosphere of the street and district where he lives, no matter how much
choice he has of pursuits outside it; and the common run of city people
do depend greatly on their neighborhoods for the kind of everyday lives
they lead.

Let us assume (as is often the case) that city neighbors have nothing
more fundamental in common with each other than that they share a
fragment of geography. Even so, if they fail at managing that fragment
decently, the fragment will fail. There exists no inconceivably
energetic and all-wise "They" to take over and substitute for localized
self-management. Neighborhoods in cities need not supply for their
people an artificial town or village life, and to aim at this is both
silly and destructive. But neighborhoods in cities do need to supply
some means for civilized self-government. This is the problem.

::: {#calibre_link-843 .section_break}
---
:::

Looking at city neighborhoods as organs of self-government, I can see
evidence that only three kinds of neighborhoods are useful: (1) the city
as a whole; (2) street neighborhoods; (and 3) districts of large,
subcity size, composed of 100,000 people or more in the case of the
largest cities.

Each of these kinds of neighborhoods has different functions, but the
three supplement each other in complex fashion. It is impossible to say
that one is more important than the others. For success with staying
power at any spot, all three are necessary. []{#calibre_link-846
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="118"}But I think that other
neighborhoods than these three kinds just get in the way, and make
successful self-government difficult or impossible.

The most obvious of the three, although it is seldom called a
neighborhood, is the city as a whole. We must never forget or minimize
this parent community while thinking of a city's smaller parts. This is
the source from which most public money flows, even when it comes
ultimately from the federal or state coffers. This is where most
administrative and policy decisions are made, for good or ill. This is
where general welfare often comes into direst conflict, open or hidden,
with illegal or other destructive interests.

Moreover, up on this plane we find vital special-interest communities
and pressure groups. The neighborhood of the entire city is where people
especially interested in the theater or in music or in other arts find
one another and get together, no matter where they may live. This is
where people immersed in specific professions or businesses or concerned
about particular problems exchange ideas and sometimes start action.
Professor P. Sargant Florence, a British specialist on urban economics,
has written, "My own experience is that, apart from the special habitat
of intellectuals like Oxford or Cambridge, a city of a million is
required to give me, say, the twenty or thirty congenial friends I
require!" This sounds rather snooty, to be sure, but Professor Florence
has an important truth here. Presumably he likes his friends to know
what he is talking about. When William Kirk of Union Settlement and
Helen Hall of Henry Street Settlement, miles apart in New York City, get
together with *Consumers' Union,* a magazine located still other miles
away, and with researchers from Columbia University, and with the
trustees of a foundation, to consider the personal and community ruin
wrought by loan shark-installment peddlers in low-income projects, they
know what each is talking about and, what is more, can put their
peculiar kinds of knowledge together with a special kind of money to
learn more about the trouble and find ways to fight it. When my sister,
Betty, a housewife, helps devise a scheme in the Manhattan public school
which one of her children attends, whereby parents who know English give
homework help to the []{#calibre_link-849 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="119"}children of parents who do not, and the scheme works, this
knowledge filters into a special-interest neighborhood of the city as a
whole; as a result, one evening Betty finds herself away over in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, telling a district group of ten
P-TA presidents there how the scheme works, and learning some new things
herself.

A city's very wholeness in bringing together people with communities of
interest is one of its greatest assets, possibly the greatest. And, in
turn, one of the assets a city district needs is people with access to
the political, the administrative, and the special interest communities
of the city as a whole.

In most big cities, we Americans do reasonably well at creating useful
neighborhoods belonging to the whole city. People with similar and
supplementing interests do find each other fairly well. Indeed, they
typically do so most efficiently in the largest cities (except for Los
Angeles which does miserably at this, and Boston which is pretty
pathetic). Moreover, big-city governments, as Seymour Freedgood of
*Fortune* magazine so well documented in *The Exploding Metropolis*, are
able and energetic at the top in many instances, more so than one would
surmise from looking at social and economic affairs in the endless
failed neighborhoods of the same cities. Whatever our disastrous
weakness may be, it is hardly sheer incapability for forming
neighborhoods at the top, out of cities as a whole.

::: {#calibre_link-852 .section_break}
---
:::

At the other end of the scale are a city's streets, and the minuscule
neighborhoods they form, like our neighborhood of Hudson Street for
example.

In the first several chapters of this book I have dwelt heavily upon the
self-government functions of city streets: to weave webs of public
surveillance and thus to protect strangers as well as themselves; to
grow networks of small-scale, everyday public life and thus of trust and
social control; and to help assimilate children into reasonably
responsible and tolerant city life.

The street neighborhoods of a city have still another function in
self-government, however, and a vital one: they must draw effectively on
help when trouble comes along that is too big for the street to handle.
This help must sometimes come from the []{#calibre_link-856 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="120"}city as a whole, at the other end of the
scale. This is a loose end I shall leave hanging, but ask you to
remember.

The self-government functions of streets are all humble, but they are
indispensable. In spite of much experiment, planned and unplanned, there
exists no substitute for lively streets.

How large is a city street neighborhood that functions capably? If we
look at successful street-neighborhood networks in real life, we find
this is a meaningless question, because wherever they work best, street
neighborhoods have no beginnings and ends setting them apart as distinct
units. The size even differs for different people from the same spot,
because some people range farther, or hang around more, or extend their
street acquaintance farther than others. Indeed, a great part of the
success of these neighborhoods of the streets depends on their
overlapping and interweaving, turning the corners. This is one means by
which they become capable of economic and visual variation for their
users. Residential Park Avenue in New York appears to be an extreme
example of neighborhood monotony, and so it would be if it were an
isolated strip of street neighborhood. But the street neighborhood of a
Park Avenue resident only begins on Park, quickly turns a corner off it,
and then another corner. It is part of a set of interweaving
neighborhoods containing great diversity, not a strip.

Isolated street neighborhoods that do have definite boundaries can be
found in plenty, to be sure. They are typically associated with long
blocks (and hence with infrequent streets), because long blocks tend
almost always to be physically self-isolating. Distinctly separate
street neighborhoods are nothing to aim for; they are generally
characteristic of failure. Describing the troubles of an area of long,
monotonous, self-isolating blocks on Manhattan's West Side, Dr. Dan W.
Dodson of New York University's Center for Human Relations Studies,
notes: "Each \[street\] appears to be a separate world of its own with a
separate, culture. Many of those interviewed had no conception of the
neighborhood other than the street on which they resided."

Summing up the incompetence of the area, Dr. Dodson comments, "The
present state of the neighborhood indicates that the people there have
lost the capacity for collective action, or else []{#calibre_link-861
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="121"}they would long since have
pressured the city government and the social agencies into correcting
some of the problems of community living." These two observations by Dr.
Dodson on street isolation and incompetence are closely related.

Successful street neighborhoods, in short, are not discrete units. They
are physical, social and economic continuities---small scale to be sure,
but small scale in the sense that the lengths of fibers making up a rope
are small scale.

Where our city streets do have sufficient frequency of commerce, general
liveliness, use and interest, to cultivate continuities of public street
life, we Americans do prove fairly capable at street self-government.
This capability is most often noticed and commented on in districts of
poor, or one-time poor people. But casual street neighborhoods, good at
their functions, are also characteristic of high-income areas that
maintain a persistent popularity---rather than ephemeral fashion---such
as Manhattan's East Side from the Fifties to the Eighties, or the
Rittenhouse Square district in Philadelphia, for example.

To be sure, our cities lack sufficient streets equipped for city life.
We have too much area afflicted with the Great Blight of Dullness
instead. But many, many city streets perform their humble jobs well and
command loyalty too, unless and until they are destroyed by the
impingement of city problems too big for them, or by neglect for too
long a time of facilities that can be supplied only from the city as a
whole, or by deliberate planning policies that the people of the
neighborhood are too weak to defeat.

::: {#calibre_link-865 .section_break}
---
:::

And here we come to the third kind of city neighborhood that is useful
for self-government: the district. This, I think, is where we are
typically most weak and fail most disastrously. We have plenty of city
districts in name. We have few that function.

The chief function of a successful district is to mediate between the
indispensable, but inherently politically powerless, street
neighborhoods, and the inherently powerful city as a whole.

Among those responsible for cities, at the top, there is much ignorance.
This is inescapable, because big cities are just too big
[]{#calibre_link-869 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="122"}and too
complex to be comprehended in detail from any vantage point---even if
this vantage point is at the top---or to be comprehended by any human;
yet detail is of the essence. A district citizens' group from East
Harlem, in anticipation of a meeting it had arranged with the Mayor and
his commissioners, prepared a document recounting the devastation
wrought in the district by remote decisions (most of them well meant, of
course), and they added this comment: "We must state how often we find
that those of us who live or work in East Harlem, coming into daily
contact with it, see it quite differently from...the people who only
ride through on their way to work, or read about it in their daily
papers or, too often, we believe, make decisions about it from desks
downtown." I have heard almost these same words in Boston, in Chicago,
in Cincinnati, in St. Louis. It is a complaint that echoes and re-echoes
in all our big cities.

Districts have to help bring the resources of a city down to where they
are needed by street neighborhoods, and they have to help translate the
experiences of real life, in street neighborhoods, into policies and
purposes of their city as a whole. And they have to help maintain an
area that is usable, in a civilized way, not only for its own residents
but for other users---workers, customers, visitors---from the city as a
whole.

To accomplish these functions, an effective district has to be large
enough to count as a force in the life of the city as a whole. The
"ideal" neighborhood of planning theory is useless for such a role. A
district has to be big and powerful enough to fight city hall. Nothing
less is to any purpose. To be sure, fighting city hall is not a
district's only function, or necessarily the most important.
Nevertheless, this is a good definition of size, in functional terms,
because sometimes a district has to do exactly this, and also because a
district lacking the power and will to fight city hall---and to
win---when its people feel deeply threatened, is unlikely to possess the
power and will to contend with other serious problems.

Let us go back to the street neighborhoods for a moment, and pick up a
loose end I left dangling: the job, incumbent upon []{#calibre_link-873
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="123"}good street neighborhoods, to get
help when too big a problem comes along.

Nothing is more helpless than a city street alone, when its problems
exceed its powers. Consider, as an illustration, what happened with
respect to a case of narcotics pushing on a street in uptown West Side
Manhattan in 1955. The street on which this case occurred had residents
who worked all over the city and had friends and acquaintances outside
the street as well as on it. On the street itself they had a reasonably
flourishing public life centered around the stoops, but they had no
neighborhood stores and no regular public characters. They also had no
connection with a district neighborhood; indeed, their area has no such
thing, except in name.

When heroin began to be sold from one of the apartments, a stream of
drug addicts filtered into the street---not to live, but to make their
connections. They needed money to buy the drugs. An epidemic of holdups
and robberies on the street was one answer. People became afraid to come
home with their pay on Fridays. Sometimes at night terrible screaming
terrorized the residents. They were ashamed to have friends visit them.
Some of the adolescents on the street were addicts, and more were
becoming so.

The residents, most of whom were conscientious and respectable, did what
they could. They called the police many times. Some individuals took the
initiative of finding that the responsible outfit to talk with was the
Narcotics Squad. They told the detectives of the squad where the heroin
was being sold, and by whom, and when, and what days supplies seemed to
come.

Nothing happened---except that things continued to get worse.

Nothing much ever happens when one helpless little street fights alone
some of the most serious problems of a great city.

Had the police been bribed? How is anybody to know?

Lacking a district neighborhood, lacking knowledge of any other persons
who cared about this problem in this place and could bring weight to
bear on it, the residents had gone as far as they knew how to go. Why
didn't they at least call their local assemblyman, or get in touch with
the political club? Nobody []{#calibre_link-881 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="124"}on the street knew those people (an
assemblyman has about 115,000 constituents) or knew anybody who did know
them. In short, this street simply had no connections of any kind with a
district neighborhood, let alone effective connections with an effective
district neighborhood. Those on the street who could possibly manage it
moved away when they saw that the street's situation was evidently
hopeless. The street plunged into thorough chaos and barbarism.

New York had an able and energetic police commissioner during these
events, but he could not be reached by everyone. Without effective
intelligence from the streets and pressure from districts, he too must
become to a degree helpless. Because of this gap, so much good intent at
the top comes to so little purpose at the bottom, and vice-versa.

Sometimes the city is not the potential helper, but the antagonist of a
street, and again, unless the street contains extraordinarily
influential citizens, it is usually helpless alone. On Hudson Street we
recently had this problem. The Manhattan Borough engineers decided to
cut ten feet off our sidewalks. This was part of a mindless, routinized
city program of vehicular road widening.

We people on the street did what we could. The job printer stopped his
press, took off of it work on which he had an urgent deadline, and
printed emergency petitions on a Saturday morning so the children, out
of school, could help get them around. People from overlapping street
neighborhoods took petitions and spread them farther. The two parochial
schools, Episcopal and Catholic, sent petitions home with their
children. We gathered about a thousand signatures from the street and
the tributaries off it; these signatures must have represented most of
the adults directly affected. Many businessmen and residents wrote
letters, and a representative group formed a delegation to visit the
Borough President, the elected official responsible.

But by ourselves, we would still hardly have had a chance. We were up
against a sanctified general policy on street treatment, and were
opposing a construction job that would mean a lot of money for somebody,
on which arrangements were already far advanced. We had learned of the
plan in advance of the demolition []{#calibre_link-886 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="125"}purely by luck. No public hearing was
required, for technically this was merely an adjustment in the curb
line.

We were told at first that the plans would not be changed; the sidewalk
must go. We needed power to back up our pipsqueak protest. This power
came from our district---Greenwich Village. Indeed, a main purpose of
our petitions, although not an ostensible purpose, was to dramatize to
the district at large that an issue had erupted. The swift resolutions
passed by district-wide organizations counted more for us than the
street-neighborhood expressions of opinion. The man who got our
delegation its appointment, Anthony Dapolito, the president of the
citizens' Greenwich Village Association, and the people on our
delegation who swung the most weight were from other streets than ours
entirely; some from the other side of the district. They swung weight
precisely because they represented opinion, and opinion makers, at
district scale. With their help, we won.

Without the possibility of such support, most city streets hardly try to
fight back---whether their troubles emanate from city hall or from other
drawbacks of the human condition. Nobody likes to practice futility.

The help we got puts some individuals on our street under obligation, of
course, to help other streets or aid more general district causes when
help is wanted. If we neglect this, we may not get help next time we
need it.

Districts effective at carrying the intelligence from the streets upward
sometimes help translate it into city policy. There is no end to such
examples, but this will do for illustration: As this is written, New
York City is supposedly somewhat reforming its treatment for drug
addicts, and simultaneously city hall is pressuring the federal
government to expand and reform its treatment work, and to increase its
efforts at blocking narcotics smuggling from abroad. The study and
agitation that have helped push these moves did not originate with some
mysterious "They." The first public agitation for reform and expansion
of treatment was stirred not by officials at all, but by district
pressure groups from districts like East Harlem and Greenwich Village.
The disgraceful way in which arrest rolls are padded with victims while
sellers operate openly and untouched is exposed and []{#calibre_link-891
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="126"}publicized by just these pressure
groups, not by officials and least of all by the police. These pressure
groups studied the problem and have pressed for changes and will
continue to, precisely because they are in direct touch with experiences
in street neighborhoods. The experience of an orphaned street like that
on the Upper West Side, on the other hand, never teaches anybody
anything---except to get the hell out.

It is tempting to suppose that districts can be formed federally out of
distinct separate neighborhoods. The Lower East Side of New York is
attempting to form an effective district today, on this pattern, and has
received large philanthropic grants for the purpose. The formalized
federation system seems to work fairly well for purposes on which
virtually everyone is agreed, such as applying pressure for a new
hospital. But many vital questions in local city life turn out to be
controversial. In the Lower East Side, for example, the federated
district organizational structure includes, as this is written, people
trying to defend their homes and neighborhoods from obliteration by the
bulldozers; and it also contains the developers of cooperative projects
and various other business interests who wish the governmental powers of
condemnation to be used to wipe out these residents. These are genuine
conflicts of interest---in this case, the ancient conflict between
predator and prey. The people trying to save themselves spend much of
their effort, futilely, trying to get resolutions adopted and letters
approved by boards of directors that contain their chief enemies!

Both sides in hot fights on important local questions need to bring
their full, consolidated, district-scale strength (nothing less is
effective) to bear on the city policy they want to shape or the
decisions they want to influence. They have to fight it out with each
other, and with officials, on the plane where the effective decisions
are made, because this is what counts in winning. Anything that diverts
such contenders into fragmenting their power and watering their efforts
by going through "decision-making" motions with hierarchies and boards
at ineffectual levels where no responsible government powers of decision
reside, vitiates political life, citizen effectiveness and
self-government. This becomes play at self-government, not the real
thing.

[]{#calibre_link-895 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="127"}When
Greenwich Village fought to prevent its park, Washington Square, from
being bisected by a highway, for example, majority opinion was
overwhelmingly against the highway. But not unanimous opinion; among
those for the highway were numerous people of prominence, with
leadership positions in smaller sections of the district. Naturally they
tried to keep the battle on a level of sectional organization, and so
did the city government. Majority opinion would have frittered itself
away in these tactics, instead of winning. Indeed, it was frittering
itself away until this truth was pointed out by Raymond Rubinow, a man
who happened to work in the district, but did not live there. Rubinow
helped form a *Joint* Emergency Committee, a true district organization
cutting through other organizational lines. Effective districts operate
as Things in their own right, and most particularly must their citizens
who are in agreement with each other on controversial questions act
together at district scale, or they get nowhere. Districts are not
groups of petty principalities, working in federation. If they work,
they work as integral units of power and opinion, large enough to count.

Our cities possess many islandlike neighborhoods too small to work as
districts, and these include not only the project neighborhoods
inflicted by planning, but also many unplanned neighborhoods. These
unplanned, too small units have grown up historically, and often are
enclaves of distinctive ethnic groups. They frequently perform well and
strongly the neighborhood functions of streets and thus keep marvelously
in hand the kinds of neighborhood social problems and rot that develop
from within. But also, just such too small neighborhoods are helpless,
in the same way streets are helpless, against the problems and rot that
develop from without. They are shortchanged on public improvements and
services because they lack power to get them. They are helpless to
reverse the slow-death warrants of area credit-blacklisting by mortgage
lenders, a problem terribly difficult to fight even with impressive
district power. If they develop conflicts with people in adjoining
neighborhoods, both they and the adjoining people are apt to be helpless
at improving relationships. Indeed, insularity makes these relationships
deteriorate further.

[]{#calibre_link-898 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="128"}Sometimes,
to be sure, a neighborhood too small to function as a district gets the
benefit of power through possessing an exceptionally influential citizen
or an important institution. But the citizens of such a neighborhood pay
for their "free" gift of power when the day comes that their interests
run counter to those of Papa Bigwheel or Papa Institution. They are
helpless to defeat Papa in the government offices, up where the
decisions are made, *and therefore they are helpless also to teach him
or influence him*. Citizens of neighborhoods that include a university,
for example, are often in this helpless fix.

Whether a district of sufficient potential power does become effective
and useful as an organ of democratic self-government depends much on
whether the insularity of too small neighborhoods within it is overcome.
This is principally a social and political problem for a district and
the contenders within it, but it is also a physical problem. To plan
deliberately, and physically, on the premise that separated city
neighborhoods of less than district size are a worthy ideal, is to
subvert self-government; that the motives are sentimental or
paternalistic is no help. When the physical isolation of too small
neighborhoods is abetted by blatant social distinctions, as in projects
whose populations are price-tagged, the policy is savagely destructive
to effective self-government and self-management in cities.

The value of city districts that swing real power (but in which street
neighborhoods are not lost as infinitesimal units) is no discovery of
mine. Their value is rediscovered and demonstrated empirically over and
over. Nearly every large city has at least one such effective district.
Many more areas struggle sporadically to function like districts in time
of crisis.

Not surprisingly, a reasonably effective district usually accrues to
itself, with time, considerable political power. It eventually
generates, too, whole series of individuals able to operate
simultaneously at street scale and district scale, and on district scale
and in neighborhoods of the city as a whole.

To correct our general disastrous failure to develop functional
districts is in great part a problem of city administrative change,
which we need not go into at this point. But we also need, among other
things, to abandon conventional planning ideas about city
[]{#calibre_link-903 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="129"}neighborhoods. The "ideal" neighborhood of planning and
zoning theory, too large in scale to possess any competence or meaning
as a street neighborhood, is at the same time too small in scale to
operate as a district. It is unfit for anything. It will not serve as
even a point of departure. Like the belief in medical bloodletting, it
was a wrong turn in the search for understanding.

::: {#calibre_link-904 .section_break}

:::

If the only kinds of city neighborhoods that demonstrate useful
functions in real-life self-government are the city as a whole, streets,
and districts, then effective neighborhood physical planning for cities
should aim at these purposes:

First, to foster lively and interesting streets.

Second, to make the fabric of these streets as continuous a network as
possible *throughout* a district of potential subcity size and power.

Third, to use parks and squares and public buildings as part of this
street fabric; use them to intensify and knit together the fabric's
complexity and multiple use. They should not be used to island off
different uses from each other, or to island off subdistrict
neighborhoods.

Fourth, to emphasize the functional identity of areas large enough to
work as districts.

If the first three aims are well pursued, the fourth will follow. Here
is why: Few people, unless they live in a world of paper maps, can
identify with an abstraction called a district, or care much about it.
Most of us identify with a place in the city because we use it, and get
to know it reasonably intimately. We take our two feet and move around
in it and come to count on it. The only reason anyone does this much is
that useful or interesting or convenient differences fairly near by
exert an attraction.

Almost nobody travels willingly from sameness to sameness and repetition
to repetition, even if the physical effort required is
trivial.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-67){#calibre_link-73 .calibre7}

[]{#calibre_link-913 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="130"}Differences,
*not duplications*, make for cross-use and hence for a person's
identification with an area greater than his immediate street network.
Monotony is the enemy of cross-use and hence of functional unity. As for
Turf, planned or unplanned, nobody outside the Turf can possibly feel a
natural identity of interest with it or with what it contains.

Centers of use grow up in lively, diverse districts, just as centers of
use occur on a smaller scale in parks, and such centers count especially
in district identification if they contain also a landmark that comes to
stand for the place symbolically and, in a way, for the district. But
centers cannot carry the load of district identification by themselves;
differing commercial and cultural facilities, and different-looking
scenes, must crop up all through. Within this fabric, physical barriers,
such as huge traffic arteries, too large parks, big institutional
groupings, are functionally destructive because they block cross-use.

How big, in absolute terms, must an effective district be? I have given
a functional definition of size: big enough to fight city hall, but not
so big that street neighborhoods are unable to draw district attention
and to count.

In absolute terms, this means different sizes in different cities,
depending partly on the size of the city as a whole. In Boston, when the
North End had a population upward of 30,000 people, it was strong in
district power. Now its population is about half that, partly from the
salutary process of uncrowding its dwellings as its people have
unslummed, and partly from the unsalutary process of being ruthlessly
amputated by a new highway. Cohesive though the North End is, it has
lost an important sum of district power. In a city like Boston,
Pittsburgh or possibly even Philadelphia, as few as 30,000 people may be
sufficient to form []{#calibre_link-917 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="131"}a district. In New York or Chicago, however, a district as
small as 30,000 amounts to nothing. Chicago's most effective district,
the Back-of-the-Yards, embraces about 100,000 people, according to the
director of the district Council, and is building up its population
further. In New York, Greenwich Village is on the small side for an
effective district, but is viable because it manages to make up for this
with other advantages. It contains approximately 80,000 residents, along
with a working population (perhaps a sixth of them the same people) of
approximately 125,000. East Harlem and the Lower East Side of New York,
both struggling to create effective districts, each contain about
200,000 residents, and need them.

Of course other qualities than sheer population size count in
effectiveness---especially good communication and good morale. But
population size is vital because it represents, if most of the time only
by implication, votes. There are only two ultimate public powers in
shaping and running American cities: votes and control of the money. To
sound nicer, we may call these "public opinion" and "disbursement of
funds," but they are still votes and money. An effective district---and
through its mediation, the street neighborhoods---possesses one of these
powers: the power of votes. Through this, and this alone, can it
effectively influence the power brought to bear on it, for good or for
ill, by public money.

Robert Moses, whose genius at getting things done largely consists in
understanding this, has made an art of using control of public money to
get his way with those whom the voters elect and depend on to represent
their frequently opposing interests. This is, of course, in other
guises, an old, sad story of democratic government. The art of negating
the power of votes with the power of money can be practiced just as
effectively by honest public administrators as by dishonest
representatives of purely private interests. Either way, seduction or
subversion of the elected is easiest when the electorate is fragmented
into ineffectual units of power.

On the maximum side, I know of no district larger than 200,000 which
operates like a district. Geographical size imposes empirical population
limits in any case. In real life, the maximum size of
[]{#calibre_link-921 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="132"}naturally
evolved, effective districts seems to be roughly about a mile and a half
square. Probably this is because anything larger gets too inconvenient
for sufficient local cross-use and for the functional identity that
underlies district political identity. In a very big city, populations
must therefore be dense to achieve successful districts; otherwise,
sufficient political power is never reconciled with viable geographic
identity.

This point on geographic size does not mean a city can be mapped out in
segments of about a square mile, the segments defined with boundaries,
and districts thereby brought to life. It is not boundaries that make a
district, but the cross-use and life. The point in considering the
physical size and limits of a district is this: the kinds of objects,
natural or man-made, that form physical barriers to easy cross-use must
be somewhere. It is better that they be at the edges of areas large
enough to work as districts than that they cut into the continuity of
otherwise feasible districts. The fact of a district lies in what it
*is* internally, and in the internal continuity and overlapping with
which it is used, not in the way it ends or in how it looks in an air
view. Indeed, in many cases very popular city districts spontaneously
extend their edges, unless prevented from doing so by physical barriers.
A district too thoroughly buffered off also runs the danger of losing
economically stimulating visitors from other parts of the
city.[\*^4^](#calibre_link-68){#calibre_link-74 .calibre7}

Neighborhood planning units that are significantly defined only by their
fabric and the life and intricate cross-use they generate, rather than
by formalistic boundaries, are of course at odds with orthodox planning
conceptions. The difference is the difference between dealing with
living, complex organisms, capable of shaping their own destinies, and
dealing with fixed and inert settlements, capable merely of custodial
care (if that) of what has been bestowed upon them.

::: {#calibre_link-924 .section_break}

:::

In dwelling on the necessity for districts, I do not want to give the
impression that an effective city district is self-contained either
[]{#calibre_link-926 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="133"}economically, politically or socially. Of course it is not
and cannot be, any more than a street can be. Nor can districts be
duplicates of one another; they differ immensely, and should. A city is
not a collection of repetitious towns. An interesting district has a
character of its own and specialties of its own. It draws users from
outside (it has little truly urban economic variety unless it does), and
its own people go forth.

Nor is there necessity for district self-containment. In Chicago's
Back-of-the-Yards, most of the breadwinners used to work, until the
1940's, at the slaughterhouses within the district. This did have a
bearing on district formation in this case, because district
organization here was a sequel to labor union organization. But as these
residents and their children have graduated from the slaughterhouse
jobs, they have moved into the working life and public life of the
greater city. Most, other than teen-agers with after-school jobs, now
work outside the district. This movement has not weakened the district;
coincident with it, the district has grown stronger.

The constructive factor that has been operating here meanwhile is time.
Time, in cities, is the substitute for self-containment. Time, in
cities, is indispensable.

The cross-links that enable a district to function as a Thing are
neither vague nor mysterious. They consist of working relationships
among specific people, many of them without much else in common than
that they share a fragment of geography.

The first relationships to form in city areas, given any neighborhood
stability, are those in street neighborhoods and those among people who
do have something else in common and belong to organizations with one
another---churches, P-TA's, businessmen's associations, political clubs,
local civic leagues, fund-raising committees for health campaigns or
other public causes, sons of such-and-such a village (common clubs among
Puerto Ricans today, as they have been with Italians), property owners'
associations, block improvement associations, protesters against
injustices, and so on, ad infinitum.

To look into almost any relatively established area of a big city turns
up so many organizations, mostly little, as to make one's head swim.
Mrs. Goldie Hoffman, one of the commissioners of []{#calibre_link-932
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="134"}Philadelphia's redevelopment
agency, decided to try the experiment of casing the organizations, if
any, and the institutions in a drear little Philadelphia section of
about ten thousand people, which was up for renewal. To her astonishment
and everyone else's, she found nineteen. Small organizations and
special-interest organizations grow in our cities like leaves on the
trees, and in their own way are just as awesome a manifestation of the
persistence and doggedness of life.

The crucial stage in the formation of an effective district goes much
beyond this, however. An interweaving, but different, set of
relationships must grow up; these are working relationships among
people, usually leaders, who enlarge their local public life beyond the
neighborhoods of streets and specific organizations or institutions and
form relationships with people whose roots and backgrounds are in
entirely different constituencies, so to speak. These hop-and-skip
relationships are more fortuitous in cities than are the analogous,
almost enforced, hop-and-skip links among people from different small
groupings within self-contained settlements. Perhaps because we are
typically more advanced at forming whole-city neighborhoods of interest
than at forming districts, hop-skip district relationships sometimes
originate fortuitously among people from a district who meet in a
special-interest neighborhood of the whole city, and then carry over
this relationship into their district. Many district networks in New
York, for instance, start in this fashion.

It takes surprisingly few hop-skip people, relative to a whole
population, to weld a district into a real Thing. A hundred or so people
do it in a population a thousand times their size. But these people must
have time to find each other, time to try expedient cooperation---as
well as time to have rooted themselves, too, in various smaller
neighborhoods of place or special interest.

When my sister and I first came to New York from a small city, we used
to amuse ourselves with a game we called Messages. I suppose we were
trying, in a dim way, to get a grip on the great, bewildering world into
which we had come from our cocoon. The idea was to pick two wildly
dissimilar individuals---say a headhunter in the Solomon Islands and a
cobbler in Rock Island, Illinois---and assume that one had to get a
message to the other by []{#calibre_link-936 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="135"}word of mouth; then we would each silently figure out a
plausible, or at least possible, chain of persons through whom the
message could go. The one who could make the shortest plausible chain of
messengers won. The headhunter would speak to the headman of his
village, who would speak to the trader who came to buy copra, who would
speak to the Australian patrol officer when he came through, who would
tell the man who was next slated to go to Melbourne on leave, etc. Down
at the other end, the cobbler would hear from his priest, who got it
from the mayor, who got it from a state senator, who got it from the
governor, etc. We soon had these close-to-home messengers down to a
routine for almost everybody we could conjure up, but we would get
tangled in long chains at the middle until we began employing Mrs.
Roosevelt. Mrs. Roosevelt made it suddenly possible to skip whole chains
of intermediate connections. She knew the most unlikely people. The
world shrank remarkably. It shrank us right out of our game, which
became too cut and dried.

A city district requires a small quota of its own Mrs.
Roosevelts---people who know unlikely people, and therefore eliminate
the necessity for long chains of communication (which in real life would
not occur at all).

Settlement-house directors are often the ones who begin such systems of
district hop-skip links, but they can only begin them and work at
opportune ways to extend them; they cannot carry the load. These links
require the growth of trust, the growth of cooperation that is, at least
at first, apt to be happenstance and tentative; and they require people
who have considerable self-confidence, or sufficient concern about local
public problems to stand them in the stead of self-confidence. In East
Harlem, where, after terrible disruption and population turnover, an
effective district is slowly re-forming against great odds, fifty-two
organizations participated in a 1960 pressure meeting to tell the Mayor
and fourteen of his commissioners what the district wants. The
organizations included P-TA's, churches, settlements and welfare groups,
civic clubs, tenant associations, businessmen's associations, political
clubs, and the local congressman, assemblyman and councilman.
Fifty-eight individuals had specific responsibilities in getting up the
meeting and setting its policy; they included people of
[]{#calibre_link-939 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="136"}all sorts of
talents and occupations, and a great ethnic range---Negroes, Italians,
Puerto Ricans, and undefinables. This represents a lot of hop-skip
district links. It has taken years and skill on the part of half a dozen
people to achieve this amount of network, and the process is only
starting to reach the stage of being effective.

Once a good, strong network of these hop-skip links does get going in a
city district, the net can enlarge relatively swiftly and weave all
kinds of resilient new patterns. One sign that it is doing so,
sometimes, is the growth of a new kind of organization, more or less
district-wide, but impermanent, formed specifically for *ad hoc*
purposes.[\*^5^](#calibre_link-69){#calibre_link-75 .calibre7} But to
get going, a district network needs these three requisites: a start of
some kind; a physical area with which sufficient people can identify as
users; and Time.

The people who form hop-skip links, like the people who form the smaller
links in streets and special-interest organizations, are not at all the
statistics that are presumed to represent people in planning and housing
schemes. Statistical people are a fiction for many reasons, one of which
is that they are treated as if infinitely
interchangeable.[\*^6^](#calibre_link-70){#calibre_link-76 .calibre7}
Real people are unique, they invest years of their lives in significant
relationships with other unique people, and are not interchangeable in
the least. Severed from their relationships, they are destroyed as
effective social beings---sometimes for a little while, sometimes
forever.

In city neighborhoods, whether streets or districts, if too many slowly
grown public relationships are disrupted at once, all kinds of havoc can
occur---so much havoc, instability and helplessness,
[]{#calibre_link-943 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="137"}that it
sometimes seems time will never again get in its licks.

Harrison Salisbury, in a series of *New York Times* articles, "The
Shook-Up Generation," put well this vital point about city relationships
and their disruption.

::: {#calibre_link-945 .section_break}

:::

"Even a ghetto \[he quoted a pastor as saying\], after it has remained a
ghetto for a period of time builds up its social structure and this
makes for more stability, more leadership, more agencies for helping the
solution of public problems."

But when slum clearance enters an area \[Salisbury went on\], it does
not merely rip out slatternly houses. It uproots the people. It tears
out the churches. It destroys the local business man. It sends the
neighborhood lawyer to new offices downtown and it mangles the tight
skein of community friendships and group relationships beyond repair.

It drives the old-timers from their broken-down flats or modest homes
and forces them to find new and alien quarters. And it pours into a
neighborhood hundreds and thousands of new faces...

::: {#calibre_link-949 .section_break}
---
:::

Renewal planning, which is largely aimed at saving buildings, and
incidentally some of the population, but at strewing the rest of a
locality's population, has much the same result. So does too heavily
concentrated private building, capitalizing in a rush on the high values
created by a stable city neighborhood. From Yorkville, in New York, an
estimated 15,000 families have been driven out between 1951 and 1960 by
this means; virtually all of them left unwillingly. In Greenwich
Village, the same thing is happening. Indeed, it is a miracle that our
cities have any functioning districts, not that they have so few. In the
first place, there is relatively little city territory at present which
is, by luck, well suited physically to forming districts with good
cross-use and identity. And within this, incipient or slightly too weak
districts are forever being amputated, bisected and generally shaken up
by misguided planning policies. The districts that are effective enough
to defend themselves from planned disruption are eventually trampled in
an unplanned gold rush by those who aim to get a cut of these rare
social treasures.

To be sure, a good city neighborhood can absorb newcomers
[]{#calibre_link-952 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="138"}into itself,
both newcomers by choice and immigrants settling by expediency, and it
can protect a reasonable amount of transient population too. But these
increments or displacements have to be gradual. If self-government in
the place is to work, underlying any float of population must be a
continuity of people who have forged neighborhood networks. These
networks are a city's irreplaceable social capital. Whenever the capital
is lost, from whatever cause, the income from it disappears, never to
return until and unless new capital is slowly and chancily accumulated.

Some observers of city life, noting that strong city neighborhoods are
so frequently ethnic communities---especially communities of Italians,
Poles, Jews or Irish---have speculated that a cohesive ethnic base is
required for a city neighborhood that works as a social unit. In effect,
this is to say that only hyphenated-Americans are capable of local
self-government in big cities. I think this is absurd.

In the first place, these ethnically cohesive communities are not always
as naturally cohesive as they may look to outsiders. Again citing the
Back-of-the-Yards as an example, its backbone population is mainly
Central European, but all kinds of Central European. It has, for
example, literally dozens of national churches. The traditional enmities
and rivalries among these groups were a most severe handicap. Greenwich
Village's three main parts derive from an Italian community, an Irish
community and a Henry Jamesian patrician community. Ethnic cohesiveness
may have played a part in the formation of these sections, but it has
been no help in welding district cross-links---a job that was begun many
years ago by a remarkable settlement-house director, Mary K. Simkhovich.
Today many streets in these old ethnic communities have assimilated into
their neighborhoods a fantastic ethnic variety from almost the whole
world. They have also assimilated a great sprinkling of middle-class
professionals and their families, who prove to do very well at city
street and district life, in spite of the planning myth that such people
need protective islands of pseudosuburban "togetherness." Some of the
streets that functioned best in the Lower East Side (before they were
wiped out) were loosely called "Jewish," but contained, as people
actually involved in the street neighborhoods, individuals of more than
[]{#calibre_link-955 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="139"}forty
differing ethnic origins. One of New York's most effective
neighborhoods, with an internal communication that is a marvel, is the
midtown East Side of predominately high-income people, utterly
undefinable except as Americans.

In the second place, wherever ethnically cohesive neighborhoods develop
and are stable, they possess another quality besides ethnic identity.
They contain many individuals who stay put. This, I think, more than
sheer ethnic identity, is the significant factor. It typically takes
many years after such groups have settled in for time to work and for
the inhabitants to attain stable, effective neighborhoods.

::: {#calibre_link-957 .section_break}
---
:::

Here is a seeming paradox: To maintain in a neighborhood sufficient
people who stay put, a city must have the very fluidity and mobility of
use that Reginald Isaacs noted, as mentioned early in this chapter, when
he speculated whether neighborhoods can therefore mean anything very
significant to cities.

Over intervals of time, many people change their jobs and the locations
of their jobs, shift or enlarge their outside friendships and interests,
change their family sizes, change their incomes up or down, even change
many of their tastes. In short they live, rather than just exist. If
they live in diversified, rather than monotonous, districts---in
districts, particularly, where many details of physical change can
constantly be accommodated---and if they like the place, they can stay
put despite changes in the locales or natures of their other pursuits or
interests. Unlike the people who must move from a lower-middle to a
middle-middle to an upper-middle suburb as their incomes and leisure
activities change (or be very outré indeed), or the people of a little
town who must move to another town or to a city to find different
opportunities, city people need not pull up stakes for such reasons.

A city's collection of opportunities of all kinds, and the fluidity with
which these opportunities and choices can be used, is an asset---not a
detriment---for encouraging city-neighborhood stability.

However, this asset has to be capitalized upon. It is thrown away where
districts are handicapped by sameness and are suitable, therefore, to
only a narrow range of incomes, tastes and family []{#calibre_link-962
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="140"}circumstances. Neighborhood
accommodations for fixed, bodiless, statistical people are
accommodations for instability. The people in them, as statistics, may
stay the same. But the people in them, as people, do not. Such places
are forever way stations.

::: {#calibre_link-963 .section_break}
---
:::

In the first section of this book, of which this is the close, I have
been emphasizing assets and strengths peculiar to big cities, and
weaknesses peculiar to them also. Cities, like anything else, succeed
only by making the most of their assets. I have tried to point out the
kinds of places in cities that do this, and the way they work. My idea,
however, is not that we should therefore try to reproduce, routinely and
in a surface way, the streets and districts that do display strength and
success as fragments of city life. This would be impossible, and
sometimes would be an exercise in architectural antiquarianism.
Moreover, even the best streets and districts can stand improvement,
especially amenity.

But if we understand the principles behind the behavior of cities, we
can build on potential assets and strengths, instead of acting at
cross-purposes to them. First we have to know the general results we
want---and know because of knowing how life in cities works. We have to
know, for instance, that we want lively, well-used streets and other
public spaces, and why we want them. But knowing what to want, although
it is a first step, is far from enough. The next step is to examine some
of the workings of cities at another level: the economic workings that
produce those lively streets and districts for city users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\*^1^](#calibre_link-71){.calibre7} In the Upper West Side of
Manhattan, a badly failed area where social disintegration has been
compounded by ruthless bulldozing, project building and shoving people
around, annual pupil turnover in schools was more than 50 percent in
1959-60. In 16 schools, it reached an average of 92 percent. It is
ludicrous to think that with any amount of effort, official or
unofficial, even a tolerable school is possible in a neighborhood of
such extreme instability. Good schools are impossible in any unstable
neighborhoods with high pupil turnover rates, and this includes unstable
neighborhoods which *also* have good housing.

[\*^2^](#calibre_link-72){.calibre7} Even the old reason for settling on
an ideal population of about 7,000---sufficient to populate an
elementary school---is silly the moment it is applied to big cities, as
we discover if we merely ask the question: Which school? In many
American cities, parochial-school enrollment rivals or surpasses
public-school enrollment. Does this mean there should be two schools as
presumed neighborhood glue, and the population should be twice as large?
Or is the population right, and should the schools be half as large? And
why the elementary school? If school is to be the touchstone of scale,
why not the junior high school, an institution typically far more
troublesome in our cities than the elementary school? The question
"Which school?" is never asked because this vision is based on no more
realism about schools than about anything else. The school is a
plausible, and usually abstract, excuse for defining *some* size for a
unit that comes out of dreams about imaginary cities. It is necessary as
a formal framework, to preserve designers from intellectual chaos, and
it has no other reason for being. Ebenezer Howard's model towns are the
ancestors of the idea, to be sure, but its durability comes from the
need to fill an intellectual vacuum.

[\*^3^](#calibre_link-73){.calibre7} Thus it was discovered in Jefferson
Houses, in East Harlem, that many people who had lived in the project
four years had never laid eyes on the community center. It is at the
dead end of the project (dead end, in the sense that no city life, only
more park, lies beyond). People from other portions of the project had
no normal reason for traveling to it from their portions and every
normal reason not to. It looked, over there, like more of the same. A
settlement-house director in the Lower East Side, Dora Tannenbaum of
Grand Street Settlement, says of people in different building groupings
of an adjacent project: "These people cannot seem to get the idea they
have anything in common with one another. They act as if the other parts
of the project were on a different planet." Visually these projects are
units. Functionally they are no such thing. The appearance tells a lie.

[\*^4^](#calibre_link-74){.calibre7} The Back-of-the-Yards in Chicago is
the only significant exception to this rule that I know of. It is an
exception with perhaps useful implications in some cases, which need not
concern us here but will be dealt with later in this book as an
administrative question.

[\*^5^](#calibre_link-75){.calibre7} In Greenwich Village, these
frequently run to long, explicit names: e.g., the Joint Emergency
Committee to Close Washington Square Park to All but Emergency Traffic;
the Cellar Dwellers' Tenant Emergency Committee; the Committee of
Neighbors to Get the Clock on Jefferson Market Courthouse Started, the
Joint Village Committee to Defeat the West Village Proposal and Get a
Proper One.

[\*^6^](#calibre_link-76){.calibre7} There are people who seemingly can
behave like interchangeable statistics and take up in a different place
exactly where they left off, but they must belong to one of our fairly
homogeneous and ingrown nomad societies, like Beatniks, or Regular Army
officers and their families, or the peripatetic junior executive
families of suburbia, described by William H. Whyte, Jr., *in The
Organization Man*.

# The generators of diversity {#calibre_link-977 .chaphead1}
:::

Classified telephone directories tell us the greatest single fact about
cities: the immense numbers of parts that make up a city, and the
immense diversity of those parts. Diversity is natural to big cities.

"I have often amused myself," wrote James Boswell in 1791, "with
thinking how different a place London is to different people. They,
whose narrow minds are contracted to the consideration of some one
particular pursuit, view it only through that medium...But the
intellectual man is struck with it, as comprehending the whole of human
life in all its variety, the contemplation of which is inexhaustible."

Boswell not only gave a good definition of cities, he put his finger on
one of the chief troubles in dealing with them. It is so easy to fall
into the trap of contemplating a city's uses one at a time, by
categories. Indeed, just this---analysis of cities, use by use---has
become a customary planning tactic. The findings on various
[]{#calibre_link-981 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="144"}categories
of use are then put together into "broad, overall pictures."

The overall pictures such methods yield are about as useful as the
picture assembled by the blind men who felt the elephant and pooled
their findings. The elephant lumbered on, oblivious to the notion that
he was a leaf, a snake, a wall, tree trunks and a rope all somehow stuck
together. Cities, being our own artifacts, enjoy less defense against
solemn nonsense.

To understand cities, we have to deal outright with combinations or
mixtures of uses, not separate uses, as the essential phenomena. We have
already seen the importance of this in the case of neighborhood parks.
Parks can easily---too easily---be thought of as phenomena in their own
right and described as adequate or inadequate in terms, say, of acreage
ratios to thousands of population. Such an approach tells us something
about the methods of planners, but it tells us nothing useful about the
behavior or value of neighborhood parks.

A mixture of uses, if it is to be sufficiently complex to sustain city
safety, public contact and cross-use, needs an enormous diversity of
ingredients. So the first question---and I think by far the most
important question---about planning cities is this: How can cities
generate enough mixture among uses---enough diversity---throughout
enough of their territories, to sustain their own civilization?

It is all very well to castigate the Great Blight of Dullness and to
understand why it is destructive to city life, but in itself this does
not get us far. Consider the problem posed by the street with the pretty
sidewalk park in Baltimore, which I mentioned back in [Chapter
Three](#calibre_link-12){.calibre7}. My friend from the street, Mrs.
Kostritsky, is quite right when she reasons that it needs some commerce
for its users' convenience. And as might be expected, inconvenience and
lack of public street life are only two of the by-products of
residential monotony here. Danger is another---fear of the streets after
dark. Some people fear to be alone in their houses by day since the
occurrence of two nasty daytime assaults, Moreover, the place lacks
commercial choices as well as any cultural interest. We can see very
well how fatal is its monotony.

But having said this, then what? The missing diversity, convenience,
[]{#calibre_link-987 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="145"}interest and
vitality do not spring forth because the area needs their benefits.
Anybody who started a retail enterprise here, for example, would be
stupid. He could not make a living. To wish a vital urban life might
somehow spring up here is to play with daydreams. The place is an
economic desert.

Although it is hard to believe, while looking at dull gray areas, or at
housing projects or at civic centers, the fact is that big cities *are*
natural generators of diversity and prolific incubators of new
enterprises and ideas of all kinds. Moreover, big cities are the natural
economic homes of immense numbers and ranges of small enterprises.

The principal studies of variety and size among city enterprises happen
to be studies of manufacturing, notably those by Raymond Vernon, author
of *Anatomy of a Metropolis*, and by P. Sargant Florence, who has
examined the effect of cities on manufacturing both here and in England.

Characteristically, the larger a city, the greater the variety of its
manufacturing, and also the greater both the number and the proportion
of its small manufacturers. The reasons for this, in brief, are that big
enterprises have greater self-sufficiency than small ones, are able to
maintain within themselves most of the skills and equipment they need,
can warehouse for themselves, and can sell to a broad market which they
can seek out wherever it may be. They need not be in cities, and
although sometimes it is advantageous for them to be there, often it is
more advantageous not to. But for small manufacturers, everything is
reversed. Typically they must draw on many and varied supplies and
skills outside themselves, they must serve a narrow market at the point
where a market exists, and they must be sensitive to quick changes in
this market. Without cities, they would simply not exist. Dependent on a
huge diversity of other city enterprises, they can add further to that
diversity. This last is a most important point to remember. City
diversity itself permits and stimulates more diversity.

For many activities other than manufacturing, the situation is
analogous. For example, when Connecticut General Life Insurance Company
built a new headquarters in the countryside beyond []{#calibre_link-993
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="146"}Hartford, it could do so only by
dint of providing---in addition to the usual working spaces and rest
rooms, medical suite and the like---a large general store, a beauty
parlor, a bowling alley, a cafeteria, a theater and a great variety of
games space. These facilities are inherently inefficient, idle most of
the time; They require subsidy, not because they are kinds of
enterprises which are necessarily money losers, but because here their
use is so limited. They were presumed necessary, however, to compete for
a working force, and to hold it. A large company can absorb the luxury
of such inherent inefficiencies and balance them against other
advantages it seeks. But small offices can do nothing of the kind. If
they want to compete for a work force on even terms or better, they must
be in a lively city setting where their employees find the range of
subsidiary conveniences and choices that they want and need. Indeed, one
reason, among many others, why the much-heralded postwar exodus of big
offices from cities turned out to be mostly talk is that the
differentials in cost of suburban land and space are typically canceled
by the greater amount of space per worker required for facilities that
in cities no single employer need provide, nor any one corps of workers
or customers support. Another reason why such enterprises have stayed in
cities, along with small firms, is that many of their employees,
especially executives, need to be in close, face-to-face touch and
communication with people outside the firm---including people from small
firms.

The benefits that cities offer to smallness are just as marked in retail
trade, cultural facilities and entertainment. This is because city
populations are large enough to support wide ranges of variety and
choice in these things. And again we find that bigness has all the
advantages in smaller settlements. Towns and suburbs, for instance, are
natural homes for huge supermarkets and for little else in the way of
groceries, for standard movie houses or driveins and for little else in
the way of theater. There are simply not enough people to support
further variety, although there may be people (too few of them) who
would draw upon it were it there. Cities, however, are the natural homes
of supermarkets and standard movie houses *plus* delicatessens, Viennese
bakeries, foreign groceries, art movies, and so on, all of which can be
found coexisting, []{#calibre_link-995 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="147"}the standard with the strange, the large with the small.
Wherever lively and popular parts of cities are found, the small much
outnumber the large. Like the small manufacturers, these small
enterprises would not exist somewhere else, in the absence of cities.
Without cities, they would not exist.

The diversity, of whatever kind, that is generated by cities rests on
the fact that in cities so many people are so close together, and among
them contain so many different tastes, skills, needs, supplies, and bees
in their bonnets.

Even quite standard, but small, operations like proprietor-and-one-clerk
hardware stores, drug stores, candy stores and bars can and do flourish
in extraordinary numbers and incidence in lively districts of cities
because there are enough people to support their presence at short,
convenient intervals, and in turn this convenience and neighborhood
personal quality are big parts of such enterprises' stock in trade. Once
they are unable to be supported at close, convenient intervals, they
lose this advantage. In a given geographical territory, half as many
people will not support half as many such enterprises spaced at twice
the distance. When distance inconvenience sets in, the small, the
various and the personal wither
away.[\*](#calibre_link-77){#calibre_link-78 .calibre7}

As we have transformed from a rural and small-town country into an urban
country, business enterprises have thus become more numerous, not only
in absolute terms, but also in proportionate terms. In 1900 there were
21 independent nonfarm businesses []{#calibre_link-999 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="148"}for each 1,000 persons in the total U.S.
population. In 1959, in spite of the immense growth of giant enterprises
during the interval, there were 26½ independent nonfarm businesses for
each 1,000 persons in the population. With urbanization, the big get
bigger, but the small also get more numerous.

Smallness and diversity, to be sure, are not synonyms. The diversity of
city enterprises includes all degrees of size, but great variety does
mean a high proportion of small elements. A lively city scene is lively
largely by virtue of its enormous collection of small elements.

Nor is the diversity that is important for city districts by any means
confined to profit-making enterprises and to retail commerce, and for
this reason it may seem that I put an undue emphasis on retail trade. I
think not, however. Commercial diversity is, in itself, immensely
important for cities, socially as well as economically. Most of the uses
of diversity on which I dwelt in Part I of this book depend directly or
indirectly upon the presence of plentiful, convenient, diverse city
commerce. But more than this, wherever we find a city district with an
exuberant variety and plenty in its commerce, we are apt to find that it
contains a good many other kinds of diversity also, including variety of
cultural opportunities, variety of scenes, and a great variety in its
population and other users. This is more than coincidence. The same
physical and economic conditions that generate diverse commerce are
intimately related to the production, or the presence, of other kinds of
city variety.

But although cities may fairly be called natural economic generators of
diversity and natural economic incubators of new enterprises, this does
not mean that cities *automatically* generate diversity just by
existing. They generate it because of the various efficient economic
pools of use that they form. Wherever they fail to form such pools of
use, they are little better, if any, at generating diversity than small
settlements. And the fact that they need diversity socially, unlike
small settlements, makes no difference. For our purposes here, the most
striking fact to note is the extraordinary unevenness with which cities
generate diversity.

On the one hand, for example, people who live and work in Boston's North
End, or New York's Upper East Side or San []{#calibre_link-1004
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="149"}Francisco's North Beach-Telegraph
Hill, are able to use and enjoy very considerable amounts of diversity
and vitality. Their visitors help immensely. But the visitors did not
create the foundations of diversity in areas like these, nor in the many
pockets of diversity and economic efficiency scattered here and there,
sometimes most unexpectedly, in big cities. The visitors sniff out where
something vigorous exists already, and come to share it, thereby further
supporting it.

At the other extreme, huge city settlements of people exist without
their presence generating anything much except stagnation and,
ultimately, a fatal discontent with the place. It is not that they are a
different kind of people, somehow duller or unappreciative of vigor and
diversity. Often they include hordes of searchers, trying to sniff out
these attributes somewhere, anywhere. Rather, something is wrong with
their districts; something is lacking to catalyze a district
population's ability to interact economically and help form effective
pools of use.

Apparently there is no limit to the numbers of people in a city whose
potentiality as city populations can thus be wasted. Consider, for
instance, the Bronx, a borough of New York containing some one and a
half million people. The Bronx is woefully short of urban vitality,
diversity and magnetism. It has its loyal residents, to be sure, mostly
attached to little bloomings of street life here and there in "the old
neighborhood," but not nearly enough of them.

In so simple a matter of city amenity and diversity as interesting
restaurants, the 1,500,000 people in the Bronx cannot produce. Kate
Simon, the author of a guidebook, *New York Places and Pleasures*,
describes hundreds of restaurants and other commercial establishments,
particularly in unexpected and out-of-the-way parts of the city. She is
not snobbish, and dearly likes to preent her readers with inexpensive
discoveries. But although Miss Simon tries hard, she has to give up the
great settlement of the Bronx as thin pickings at any price. After
paying homage to the two solid metropolitan attractions in the borough,
the zoo and the Botanical Gardens, she is hard put to recommend a single
place to eat outside the zoo grounds. The one possibility she is able to
offer, she accompanies with this apology: "The neighborhood
[]{#calibre_link-1008 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="150"}trails off
sadly into a no man's land, and the restaurant can stand a little
refurbishing, but there's the comfort of knowing that...the best of
Bronx medical skill is likely to be sitting all around you."

Well, that is the Bronx, and it is too bad it is so; too bad for the
people who live there now, too bad for the people who are going to
inherit it in future out of their lack of economic choice, and too bad
for the city as a whole.

And if the Bronx is a sorry waste of city potentialities, as it is,
consider the even more deplorable fact that it is possible for whole
cities to exist, whole metropolitan areas, with pitifully little city
diversity and choice. Virtually all of urban Detroit is as weak on
vitality and diversity as the Bronx. It is ring superimposed upon ring
of failed gray belts. Even Detroit's downtown itself cannot produce a
respectable amount of diversity. It is dispirited and dull, and almost
deserted by seven o'clock of an evening.

So long as we are content to believe that city diversity represents
accident and chaos, of course its erratic generation appears to
represent a mystery.

However, the conditions that generate city diversity are quite easy to
discover by observing places in which diversity flourishes and studying
the economic reasons why it can flourish in these places. Although the
results are intricate, and the ingredients producing them may vary
enormously, this complexity is based on tangible economic relationships
which, in principle, are much simpler than the intricate urban mixtures
they make possible.

To generate exuberant diversity in a city's streets and districts, four
conditions are indispensable:

1\. The district, and indeed as many of its internal parts as possible,
must serve more than one primary function; preferably more than two.
These must insure the presence of people who go outdoors on different
schedules and are in the place for different purposes, but who are able
to use many facilities in common.

2\. Most blocks must be short; that is, streets and opportunities to
turn corners must be frequent.

3\. The district must mingle buildings that vary in age and condition,
including a good proportion of old ones so that they vary
[]{#calibre_link-1017 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="151"}in the
economic yield they must produce. This mingling must be fairly
close-grained.

4\. There must be a sufficiently dense concentration of people, for
whatever purposes they may be there. This includes dense concentration
in the case of people who are there because of residence.

The necessity for these four conditions is the most important point this
book has to make. In combination, these conditions create effective
economic pools of use. Given these four conditions, not all city
districts will produce a diversity equivalent to one another. The
potentials of different districts differ for many reasons; but, given
the development of these four conditions (or the best approximation to
their full development that can be managed in real life), a city
district should be able to realize its best potential, wherever that may
lie. Obstacles to doing so will have been removed. The range may not
stretch to African sculpture or schools of drama or Rumanian tea houses,
but such as the possibilities are, whether for grocery stores, pottery
schools, movies, candy stores, florists, art shows, immigrants' clubs,
hardware stores, eating places, or whatever, they will get their best
chance. And along with them, city life will get its best chances.

In the four chapters that follow, I shall discuss each of these four
generators of diversity, one at a time. The purpose of explaining them
one at a time is purely for convenience of exposition, not because any
one---or even any three---of these necessary conditions is valid alone.
*All* four in combination are necessary to generate city diversity; the
absence of any one of the four frustrates a district's potential.

[\*](#calibre_link-78){.calibre7} In retail trade, this tendency has
been growing stronger, if anything. Richard Nelson, the Chicago real
estate analyst, examining the postwar trend of retail sales in some
twenty city downtowns, has discovered that the large department stores
have typically lost trade; the chain variety stores have stayed about
even; and the small and special stores have increased their business and
usually have also increased in number. There is no real competition
outside the cities for these small and various city enterprises; but it
is relatively easy for the big and standardized, in their natural homes
outside the city, to compete with what is big and standardized within.
This happens, incidentally, to be exactly what has occurred in the
neighborhood where I live. Wanamaker's, the big department store
formerly located in Greenwich Village, has gone out of business here and
established itself in a suburb instead, at the same time that small and
special stores in its immediate former vicinity have increased by the
score and flourished mightily.

On successful city streets, people must appear at different times. This
is time considered on a small scale, hour by hour through the day. I
have already explained this necessity in social terms while discussing
street safety and also neighborhood parks. Now I shall point out its
economic effects.

Neighborhood parks, you will recall, need people who are in the
immediate vicinity for different purposes from one another, or else the
parks will be used only sporadically.

Most consumer enterprises are just as dependent as parks on
[]{#calibre_link-1031 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="153"}people
going to and fro throughout the day, but with this difference: If parks
lie idle, it is bad for them and their neighborhoods but they do not
disappear as a consequence. If consumer enterprises lie idle for much of
the day they may disappear. Or, to be more accurate, in most such cases
they never appear in the first place. Stores, like parks, need
users.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-79){#calibre_link-84 .calibre7}

For a humble example of the economic effects of people spread through
time of day, I will ask you to think back to a city sidewalk scene: the
ballet of Hudson Street. The continuity of this movement (which gives
the street its safety) depends on an economic foundation of basic mixed
uses. The workers from the laboratories, meat-packing plants,
warehouses, plus those from a bewildering variety of small
manufacturers, printers and other little industries and offices, give
all the eating places and much of the other commerce support at midday.
We residents on the street and on its more purely residential
tributaries could and would support a modicum of commerce by ourselves,
but relatively little. We possess more convenience, liveliness, variety
and choice than we "deserve" in our own right. The people who work in
the neighborhood also possess, on account of us residents, more variety
than they "deserve" in their own right. We support these things together
by unconsciously cooperating economically. If the neighborhood were to
lose the industries, it would be a disaster for us residents. Many
enterprises, unable to exist on residential trade by itself, would
disappear. Or if the industries were to lose us residents, enterprises
unable to exist on the working people by themselves would disappear.

As it is, workers and residents together are able to produce *more* than
the sum of our two parts. The enterprises we are capable of supporting,
mutually, draw out onto the sidewalk by evening many more residents than
would emerge if the place were moribund. And, in a modest way, they also
attract still another crowd in addition to the local residents or local
workers. They attract people who want a change from their neighborhoods,
just []{#calibre_link-1034 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="154"}as we
frequently want a change from ours. This attraction exposes our commerce
to a still larger and more diverse population, and this in turn has
permitted a still further growth and range of commerce living on all
*three* kinds of population in varying proportions: a shop down the
street selling prints, a store that rents diving equipment, a dispensary
of first-rate pizza, a pleasant coffee house.

Sheer numbers of people using city streets, and the way those people are
spread through the hours of the day, are two different matters. I shall
deal with sheer numbers in another chapter; at this stage it is
important to understand that numbers, in hemselves, are not an
equivalent for people distributed through time of day.

::: {#calibre_link-1036 .section_break}

:::

The significance of time spread can be seen especially clearly at the
downtown tip of Manhattan, because this is a district suffering from
extreme time unbalance among its users. Some 400,000 persons are
employed here, in a district embracing Wall Street, the adjoining law
and insurance complexes, the city's municipal offices, some federal and
state offices, groups of docks and shipping offices, and a number of
other work complexes. An undetermined but considerable additional number
of people visit the district during working hours, mostly on office or
government business.

This is an immense number of users for a territory sufficiently compact
so that any part of it is readily accessible on foot from almost any
other part. Among them, these users represent a tremendous daily demand
for meals and other goods, to say nothing of cultural services.

Yet the district is miserable at providing services and amenities
proportionate to the need. Its eating places and clothing shops are
pitifully inadequate in number and variety for the demands on them. The
district used to have one of the best hardware stores in New York, but a
few years ago it could no longer make ends meet, and closed. It had one
of the finest, largest and longest established food specialty stores in
the city; it too has recently closed down. Once upon a time it had a few
movies but they became sleeping places for the leisured indigent and
eventually disappeared. The district's cultural opportunities are nil.

All these lacks, which may seem on the surface to be frivolous,
[]{#calibre_link-1041 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="155"}are a
handicap. Firm after firm has left for mixed-use midtown Manhattan
(which has become the city's main downtown). As one real estate broker
put it, otherwise their personnel departments can't get or keep people
who can spell "molybdenum." These losses, in turn, have badly undermined
the district's once supreme convenience for face-to-face business
contacts, so that now law firms and banks are moving out, to be closer
to clients who have already moved. The district has become second-rate
in its very function---providing managerial headquarters---which is the
foundation of its prestige and usefulness and its reason for being.

Meantime, outside of the big offices that form the breathtaking skyline
of lower Manhattan is a ring of stagnation, decay, vacancies and
vestigial industries. Consider this paradox: Here are plenty of people,
and people moreover who want and value city diversity badly enough so it
is difficult or sometimes impossible to keep them from scooting away
elsewhere to get it. And here, cheek-by-jowl with the demand, are plenty
of convenient and even empty places for diversity to grow in. What can
be wrong?

To see what is wrong, it is only necessary to drop in at any ordinary
shop and observe the contrast between the mob scene at lunch and the
dullness at other times. It is only necessary to observe the deathlike
stillness that settles on the district after five-thirty and all day
Saturday and Sunday.

"They come in like a tide," the *New York Times* quoted a saleswoman in
a clothing store. "I always know when it's a few minutes after noon."
"The first group floods the store from noon to just before 1
[P]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}.," the *Times* reporter went on to explain.
"Then there is a short breathing spell. A few minutes after 1
[P]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}. a second group spills in." And then,
although the paper did not say so, a few minutes before 2
[P]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}. the store goes dead.

The business done by consumers' enterprises here must be mainly crammed
into some two or three hours a day, some ten or fifteen hours a week.
This degree of underuse is a miserable inefficiency for any plant. A
certain number of enterprises can cover their overhead and make a profit
by exploiting the midday mob operation to the hilt. But there must be
few enough so that each reaps a capacity mob at that time. Restaurants
too can live []{#calibre_link-1046 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="156"}on lunch and coffee breaks, instead of lunch and dinner, if
there are relatively so few that they do a quick-turnover business in
their too few bonanza hours. How does this add up to general convenience
and amenity for those 400,000 workers? Badly.

It is no accident that the New York Public Library gets more anguished
telephone calls from this district than from any other---at lunchtime,
of course---asking, "Where is the library branch down here? I can't find
it." There is none, typically enough. If there were, it could hardly be
built big enough for the queues at lunchtime and perhaps at five o'clock
and hardly small enough for the trade at other times.

Aside from the mob-scene enterprises, other retail services can and do
manage by keeping their overhead abnormally low. This is how most of the
interesting and civilized and unusual places which have not yet gone out
of business manage to exist, and the reason why they are in singularly
decrepit and decaying lodgings.

The business and financial interests represented in lower Manhattan have
for several years, in cooperation with the city, been working hard at
preparing plans and starting work to regenerate this area. They have
proceeded according to orthodox planning beliefs and principles.

The first step in their reasoning is good. They face the fact of
trouble, and also face its general nature. The planning brochure
prepared by the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association says: "To ignore
the factors that threaten the economic health of lower Manhattan is to
accept a continuing exodus of long-established businesses and activities
to areas in which they can find better working conditions and a more
agreeable and convenient environment for their employees."

The brochure indicates, moreover, a glimmer of understanding about the
need to spread people through time of day, for it states, "A residential
population would stimulate the development of shopping facilities,
restaurants, places of entertainment and garage facilities which would
prove highly desirable for use by the daytime working population as
well."

But it is only a poor glimmer of understanding and the plans themselves
are an exercise in cures irrelevant to the disease.

A residential population is, to be sure, introduced in the proposed
[]{#calibre_link-1054 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="157"}plans. It
will take up a lot of territory, in the form of project buildings,
parking lots and empty land, but in people---as the brochure itself
states---it will amount to only about 1 percent of the number of persons
in the daytime population. What Herculean economic power that little
band is to exert! What amazing feats of hedonism must it accomplish to
support "the development of shopping facilities, restaurants, places of
entertainment...highly desirable for use by the daytime working
population as well!"

The new residential population is to be, of course, only part of the
plan. The other parts will intensify the present trouble. They will do
so in two ways. First, they are aimed at bringing in still more daytime
work uses---manufacturing, international trade offices and a huge new
federal office building, among others. Second, the land clearance
planned for these additional working places and for the housing projects
and the associated highways will clear out---along with empty buildings
and decayed work uses---much of the low-overhead service and commerce
that does still exist to serve the working population. Facilities
already too meager in range (and number) for the working population will
be further subtracted, as a by-product to adding *more* working
population and an utterly meaningless number of residents. Conditions
already inconvenient will become intolerable. The plans, moreover, will
foreclose the chance of reasonably adequate services ever being
developed, because no room, at economical rents for the incubation of
new enterprise, will exist for them.

Lower Manhattan is in really serious trouble, and the routine reasoning
and remedies of orthodox planning merely compound the trouble. What
could be done to ameliorate *effectively* the district's extreme time
unbalance of users, which is the root of its trouble?

Residence, no matter how introduced, cannot help effectively. The
daytime use of the district is so intensive that residents, even at the
highest densities possible, would always be ineffectually small in their
proportionate numbers, and would preempt territories of a size utterly
disproportionate to the economic contribution they could render here.

The first step in planning the infusion of new potential uses is
[]{#calibre_link-1059 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="158"}to have a
practical idea of what the infusion must accomplish if it is to overcome
the district's root trouble.

The infusion would obviously have to result in the presence of maximum
numbers of persons at the times when the district needs them most for
time balance: midafternoons (between two and five o'clock), evenings,
Saturdays and Sundays. The only possible concentrations large enough to
make any difference would consist of great numbers of visitors at those
times, and this in turn has to mean tourists together with many people
of the city itself, coming back over and over again in their leisure
time.

Whatever it is that attracts this infusion of new people must also be
attractive to people who work in the district. At least its presence
cannot bore or repel them.

This new putative use (or uses) cannot, furthermore, replace wholesale
the very buildings and territories in which new, spontaneous enterprises
and facilities, stimulated by the new time spread of people, can grow
with the freedom and flexibility of accommodations they will need.

And finally, this new use (or uses) ought to be in accord with the
district's character, certainly not at cross-purposes to it. It is the
character of lower Manhattan to be intensive, to be exciting, to be
dramatic, and this is one of its greatest assets. What is more dramatic,
even romantic, than the tumbled towers of lower Manhattan, rising
suddenly to the clouds like a magic castle girdled by water? Its very
touch of jumbled jaggedness, its towering-sided canyons, are its
magnificence. What vandalism it would represent (what vandalism the
present project plans represent!) to dilute this magnificent city
presence with the humdrum and the regimented.

What does exist here to draw visitors at leisure hours, for instance on
week ends? Over the years, unfortunately, almost every unique appeal to
visitors that could possibly be rooted out of this district by plan has
been rooted out. The aquarium, which used to sit in Battery Park at the
tip of the island and was the main attraction of that park, has been
removed and rebuilt in Coney Island, the last place it was needed. A
strange and vital little Armenian neighborhood (*there* was residence
that counted because of its uniqueness as a tourist and visitor
attraction) was rooted out lock, []{#calibre_link-1065 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="159"}stock and barrel for a tunnel approach, and
now the guidebooks and the women's pages of the newspapers send visitors
over to Brooklyn to find its transplanted remnants and extraordinary
shops. The excursion boats, the trip to the Statue of Liberty, have been
surrounded by less glamor than the checkout line in a supermarket. The
Parks Department snack bar at the Battery is about as appealing as a
school cafeteria. Battery Park itself, in the most stirring location of
the city, riding into the harbor like a prow, has been made to resemble
the grounds of an old people's home. Everything thus far inflicted on
this district by plan (and everything more which has been proposed by
plan) says in the plainest terms to human beings, "Go away! Leave me
alone!" Nothing says, "Come on!"

So much could be done.

The waterfront itself is the first wasted asset capable of drawing
people at leisure. Part of the district's waterfront should become a
great marine museum---the permanent anchorage of specimen and curiosity
ships, the best collection to be seen and boarded anywhere. This would
bring into the district tourists in the afternoon, tourists and people
of the city, both, on week ends and holidays, and in summertime it
should be a great thing for the evening. Other features of the shoreline
should be the embarkation points for pleasure voyages in the harbor and
around the island; these embarkation points should be as glamorous and
salty as art can make them. If new sea-food restaurants and much else
would not start up nearby, I will eat my lobster shell.

There should be related attractions, set not at the shoreline itself but
inland a little, within the matrix of streets, deliberately to carry
visitors farther in easy steps. A new aquarium should be built, for
example, and it ought to be admission-free, unlike the one at Coney. A
city of almost eight million can support two aquariums and can afford to
show off its fish free. That public-library branch which is needed so
badly should be built, and it should be not only the usual circulating
branch, but also the specialized library center for all marine and
financial lore.

Special events based on all these attractions should be concentrated in
evenings and week ends; inexpensive theater and opera ought to be added.
Jason Epstein, a publisher and student of cities, []{#calibre_link-1070
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="160"}who has thoughtfully considered
the experiments of European cities for clues helpful to lower Manhattan,
suggests a permanent one-ring circus, like the one in Paris. This, if it
were done well, would be far more effective as sheer economic support to
the long-term business value of this district than the dreary additions
of more manufacturing plants, taking up the room, contributing nothing
the district needs to maintain its strength (and depriving of their
presence other parts of the city that really need manufacturing plants).

As the district livened up during evenings and week ends, we could
expect some new residential use to appear spontaneously. Lower Manhattan
does contain numerous old houses, run down but fundamentally attractive,
of just the kind that have been rehabilitated elsewhere when life broke
out. People in search of what is both unique and alive would ferret them
out. However, residence in such an area as this must necessarily be a
manifestation of district vitality, rather than a cause of it.

Do my suggestions for additional uses based on leisure-time attraction
seem frivolous and expensive?

Consider, then, the expected cost of the plans prepared by the
Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association and the city for more working
places still, for the housing projects and parking lots, and for the
highways to take the project people out of the district on week ends.

These things are to cost, their planners estimate, *one billion dollars*
of public and private money!

The extreme condition of currently unbalanced spread of people through
time of day in lower Manhattan illustrates a number of sobering
principles that apply equally to other city districts:

No neighborhood or district, no matter how well established, prestigious
or well heeled, and no matter how intensely populated for one purpose,
can flout the necessity for spreading people through time of day without
frustrating its potential for generating diversity.

Furthermore, a neighborhood or district perfectly calculated, it seems,
to fill one functipn, whether work or any other, and with everything
ostensibly necessary to that function, cannot actually provide what is
necessary if it is confined to that one function.

[]{#calibre_link-1079 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="161"}Unless a
plan for a district which lacks spread of people through time of day
gets at the cause of the trouble, the best that can be done is to
replace old stagnation with new. It may look cleaner for a while, but
that is not much to buy with a lot of money.

::: {#calibre_link-1080 .section_break}

:::

It should be clear by now that I am discussing two different kinds of
diversity. The first, primary uses, are those which, in themselves,
bring people to a specific place because they are anchorages. Offices
and factories are primary uses. So are dwellings. Certain places of
entertainment, education and recreation are primary uses. To a degree
(that is, for an appreciable proportion of their users), so are many
museums, libraries and galleries, but not all.

Primary uses can be unusual sometimes. In Louisville, since the war a
great sample shoe market, for bargain, odd-lot shoes, has gradually
grown up in about thirty stores concentrated on four blocks of one
street. Grady Clay, real estate editor of the *Louisville
Courier-Journal,* and a leading city design and planning critic, reports
that the group has about a half-million pairs of shoes on display and in
warehouses. "This is in the inner gray area," Mr. Clay writes me, "but
as soon as the word got around, customers began flocking in from all
over, so that you see Indianapolis, Nashville, Cincinnati shoppers, plus
a good Cadillac trade. I have been thinking a bit about it. Nobody could
have planned this growth. Nobody has encouraged it. The biggest threat,
in fact, is the expressway which will cut diagonally across. Nobody at
City Hall seems at all concerned about it. I hope to stir up some
interest..."

As this suggests, you cannot tell from outward impressiveness or other
signs of putative importance how effective a primary use is, as an
attractor of people. Some of the most impressive *looking* are
ineffectual in performance. For instance, the main building of
Philadelphia's public library, stuck in a monumental cultural center,
draws fewer users than three of the library's branches, including an
attractive but, unostentatious establishment inserted among the downtown
shops of Chestnut Street. Like many cultural enterprises, libraries are
a combination of primary use and []{#calibre_link-1084 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="162"}convenience use, and work best as either
when they combine these attributes. In size and appearance then, and in
its stock of books, the main library building is more significant; but
in its role as an element of city use, the small branch is more
significant, belying appearances. It is always necessary to think of
performance in terms of users when trying to understand how primary
mixtures work.

Any primary use whatever, by itself is relatively ineffectual as a
creator of city diversity. If it is combined with another primary use
that brings people in and out and puts them on the street at the same
time, nothing has been accomplished. In practical terms, we cannot even
call these differing primary uses. However, when a primary use is
combined, effectively, with another that puts people on the street at
different times, then the effect can be economically stimulating: a
fertile environment for secondary diversity.

Secondary diversity is a name for the enterprises that grow in response
to the presence of primary uses, to serve the people the primary uses
draw. If this secondary diversity serves single primary uses, no matter
what the type of use, it is innately inefficient. Serving mixed primary
uses, it can be innately efficient and---if the other three conditions
for generating diversity are favorable also---it can be
exuberant.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-80){#calibre_link-85 .calibre7}

If this spread of street use spreads a variety of consumer needs or
tastes through time of day, all sorts of uniquely urban and specialized
services and shops can make out, and this is a process that builds upon
itself. The more intricately mixed, and therefore efficient, the pools
of users are, the more services and shops there can be that need to sift
their clienteles from all sorts of population, []{#calibre_link-1088
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="163"}and in turn the more people are
drawn. So it is necessary here to make still another distinction.

If secondary diversity flourishes sufficiently and contains enough that
is unusual or unique, it seemingly can and does become, in its
accumulation, a primary use itself. People come specifically for it.
This is what happens in good shopping districts or even, to a humble
extent, on Hudson Street. I do not wish to minimize this occurrence; it
is vital to the economic health of city streets and districts, and to
cities as a whole. It is vital to city fluidity of use, to great choice,
and to interesting and useful differences in character among streets and
districts.

Nevertheless, secondary diversity seldom becomes quite a primary use
fully "in its own right." If it is to have staying power, and the
vitality to grow and change, it must retain its basic foundation of
mixed primary uses---people spread through time of day because of fixed
reasons. This is true even of downtown shopping, which is there,
basically, because of other mixed primary uses, and which withers (even
if slowly) when these become seriously unbalanced.

I have mentioned several times in passing that primary use mixtures must
be *effective* if they are to generate diversity. What makes them
effective? They must, of course, be combined with the other three
conditions that stimulate diversity. But in addition, the primary
mixture has to perform effectively itself.

Effectiveness means, first, that the people using the streets at
different times must actually use the *same* streets. If their paths are
separated from one another's, or buffered from one another's, there is
no mixture in reality. In terms of city-street economics, mutual support
among differences is then a fiction, or something to be seen merely as
an abstraction of adjoining different uses, with no meaning except on a
map.

Effectiveness means, second, that the people using the same streets at
differing times must include, among them, people who will use some of
the same facilities. All kinds of people can be present, but those who
turn up for one reason at one time must not be sorted out in some
totally incompatible fashion from those who turn up for another reason.
As an extreme example, where the new home of the Metropolitan Opera in
New York is to share []{#calibre_link-1094 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="164"}a street with a low-income public housing project across the
way, the juncture is meaningless---even if there were a place here for
mutually supported diversity to grow. This type of hopeless economic
contretemps seldom turns up naturally in a city, but it is frequently
introduced by plan.

And finally, effectiveness means that the mixture of people on a street
at one time of day must bear some reasonably proportionate relationship
to people there at other times of day. I have already made this point in
discussing the plans for the lower tip of Manhattan. It has often been
observed that lively downtowns are apt to have dwellings fingering into
them and close beside them, and night uses these residents enjoy and
help support. This is an accurate observation so far as it goes, and on
the strength of it many cities are expecting miracles from residential
projects downtown, in the fashion of the lower Manhattan plan. But in
real life, where such combinations have vitality the residents are part
of a very complex pool of downtown day, night and week-end uses in
reasonable balance.

Similarly, a few thousand workers dribbled in among tens or hundreds of
thousands of residents make no appreciable balance either in sum or at
any particular spot of any significance. Or a lone office building amid
a large grouping of theaters amounts to little or nothing in practical
terms. In short, with primary mixtures, it is everyday, ordinary
performance in mixing people, as pools of economic mutual support, that
counts. This is the point, and it is a tangible, concrete economic
matter, not a vaguely "atmospheric" effect.

::: {#calibre_link-1097 .section_break}
---
:::

I have been dwelling upon downtowns. This is not because mixtures of
primary uses are unneeded elsewhere in cities. On the contrary they are
needed, and the success of mixtures downtown (or in the most intensive
portions of cities, whatever they are called) is related to the mixture
possible in other parts of cities.

I have been dwelling on downtowns for two reasons in particular. First,
insufficient primary mixture is typically the principal fault in our
downtowns, and often the only disastrous basic fault. Most big-city
downtowns fulfill---or in the past did fulfill---all
[]{#calibre_link-1100 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="165"}four of the
necessary conditions for generating diversity. That is why they were
able to become downtowns. Today, typically, they still do fulfill three
of the conditions. But they have become (for reasons that will be
discussed in [Chapter Thirteen](#calibre_link-24){.calibre7}) too
predominately devoted to work and contain too few people after working
hours. This condition has been more or less formalized in planning
jargon, which no longer speaks of "downtowns" but instead of
"CBD's"---standing for Central Business Districts. A Central Business
District that lives up to its name and is truly described by it, is a
dud. Few downtowns have reached (yet) the degree of unbalance to be
found at the lower tip of Manhattan. Most have, in addition to their
working people, a good many daytime shoppers during working hours and on
Saturdays. But most are on their way toward this unbalance, and have
fewer potential assets than lower Manhattan has for retrieving
themselves.

The second reason for emphasizing primary mixtures downtown is the
direct effect on other parts of cities. Probably everyone is aware of
certain general dependencies by a city on its heart. When a city heart
stagnates or disintegrates, a city as a social neighborhood of the whole
begins to suffer: People who ought to get together, by means of central
activities that are failing, fail to get together. Ideas and money that
ought to meet, and do so often only by happenstance in a place of
central vitality, fail to meet. The networks of city public life develop
gaps they cannot afford. Without a strong and *inclusive* central heart,
a city tends to become a collection of interests isolated from one
another. It falters at producing something greater, socially, culturally
and economically, than the sum of its separated parts.

All these considerations are important, but I have in mind here a more
specific economic effect exerted by a strong city heart upon other
districts.

The peculiar benefits that cities afford to incubation operate, as I
have pointed out, most efficiently and surely where the most complex
pools of use form. From such incubators of enterprise spring economic
youngsters that may---and in real life do---later transfer their power
to other parts of a city.

This movement has been well described by Richard Ratcliff, professor of
land economics at the University of Wisconsin. "Decentralization
[]{#calibre_link-1105 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="166"}is a
symptom of degeneration and decay," says Ratcliff, "only if it leaves a
vacuum behind. Where decentralization is the product of centripetal
forces, it is healthy. Much of the outward movement of certain urban
functions occurs as they are pushed out of the center, rather than as
they respond to a pull toward outlying locations."

In a healthy city, notes Professor Ratcliff, there is a constant
replacement of less intensive uses by more intensive
uses.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-81){#calibre_link-86 .calibre7} "Artificially
induced dispersion is another question. It holds the danger of loss in
total efficiency and productivity."

In New York, as Raymond Vernon has noted in *Anatomy of a Metropolis*,
the intensive developments of parts of Manhattan Island for white-collar
work have been pushing manufacturers out into the other boroughs. (When
city manufacturers get big and self-sufficient enough they may go to
suburbs or little towns, which depend economically too on the powerful
incubating effects of those wonderfully productive places, intensive big
cities.)

Uses crowded out from incubators of diversity and enterprise are of two
kinds, like other city diversity. If they are crowded-out secondary
diversity, serving people drawn by mixtures of primary uses, they must
find other places in which secondary diversity can flourish---other
places with mixtures of primary uses, among other factors---or else
languish and probably die. Their movement, if they are able to find
congenial places, can represent opportunity for a city. They help
heighten and speed the formation of further complex city. This is one of
the influences, for example, from outside Hudson Street that has been
affecting us. This is where the skin-diver equipment people come from,
and the print and framing people, and the sculptor who took over an
empty store. They are enterprises bubbling over from more intensive
generators of diversity.

Although this movement is valuable (if it is not lost for lack of
sufficient economically fertile ground), it is less significant and
basic than the movement of primary diversity crowded out from intensive
centers. For when primary uses, such as manufacturing,
[]{#calibre_link-1110 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="167"}for
instance, boil over and outward from pools of use that can no longer
contain everything they generate, these can become ingredients of
primary mixture in places where the primary use of work is desperately
needed. Their presence can help create new pools of primary mixed use.

One land-use economist, Larry Smith, has aptly called office buildings
chess pieces. "You have used up those chess pieces already," he is said
to have told a planner who was trying to revitalize an unrealistic
number of spots with dreamy plans for new office buildings. All primary
uses, whether offices, dwellings or concert halls, are a city's
chessmen. Those that move differently from one another must be employed
*in concert* to accomplish much. And as in chess, a pawn can be
converted to a queen. But city building has this difference from chess:
The number of pieces is not fixed by the rules. If well deployed, the
pieces multiply.

In city downtowns, public policy cannot inject directly the entirely
private enterprises that serve people after work and enliven and help
invigorate the place. Nor can public policy, by any sort of fiat, hold
these uses in a downtown. But indirectly, public policy can encourage
their growth by using its own chessmen, and those susceptible to public
pressure, in the right places as primers.

Carnegie Hall, on West Fifty-seventh Street in New York, is a striking
example of such a primer. It has worked remarkably well for its street
in spite of the serious handicap of too-long blocks. The presence of
Carnegie Hall, which brings intensive use to the street by night,
generated in time the presence of another use that needs night
business---two motion-picture theaters. And because Carnegie Hall is a
music center, it generated the presence of many small music, dance and
drama studios and recital rooms. All this is mixed and woven with
residences---two hotels and many apartments close by, which have all
kinds of tenants, but notably a great many who are musicians and
teachers of music. The street works by day because of small office
buildings, and large office buildings to east and west, and finally
because the double-shift use is able to support secondary diversity that
has, in time, become an attraction too. The time spread of users is of
course stimulating to restaurants, and here is a whole gamut: a fine
Italian restaurant, []{#calibre_link-1114 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="168"}a glamorous Russian restaurant, a sea-food restaurant, an
espresso house, several bars, an Automat, a couple of soda fountains, a
hamburger house. Between and among the restaurants you can buy rare
coins, old jewelry, old or new books, very nice shoes, art supplies,
remarkably elaborate hats, flowers, gourmet foods, health foods,
imported chocolates. You can buy or sell thrice-worn Dior dresses and
last year's minks, or rent an English sports car.

In this case, Carnegie Hall is a vital chessman, working in concert with
other chessmen. The most ruinous plan that could be devised for this
entire neighborhood would be to destroy Carnegie Hall and replace it
with another office building. This was precisely what was about to
happen, as an accompaniment to New York's decision to take all its most
impressive, or potentially impressive, cultural chessmen out of play and
segregate them in a planning island called the Lincoln Center for the
Performing Arts. Carnegie Hall was saved by a hair, owing to stubborn
citizen pressure politics, although it will no longer be the home of the
New York Philharmonic, which is going to decontaminate itself from the
ordinary city.

Now this is a pitiful kind of planning, which would blindly destroy a
city's existing pools of use and automatically foster new problems of
stagnation, as a thoughtless by-product to pushing through new dreams.
Chessmen---and in downtowns night-use chessmen that can be located by
public policy or public pressure---should be placed to fortify and
extend existing vitality, and also to help balance up, in strategic
places, existing time unbalances. New York's midtown has many places
with intensive daytime use that go ominously dead at night, that need
precisely the chessmen being taken out of play at Lincoln Center. The
stretch of new office building centering on Park Avenue between Grand
Central Station and Fifty-ninth Street is such a territory. The area
just south of Grand Central is another. The shopping district centering
on Thirty-fourth Street is another. Many a once vital district, having
lost in the past a mixture of primary uses which brought attraction,
popularity and high economic value, has declined sadly.

This is why projects such as cultural or civic centers, besides
[]{#calibre_link-1118 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="169"}being
woefully unbalanced themselves as a rule, are tragic in their effects on
their cities. They isolate uses---and too often intensive night uses
too---from the parts of cities that must have them or sicken.

Boston was the first American city to plan for itself a decontaminated
cultural district. In 1859, a Committee of Institutes called for a
"Cultural Conservation," setting aside a tract to be devoted "solely to
institutions of an educational, scientific and artistic character," a
move that coincided with the beginning of Boston's long, slow decline as
a live cultural leader among American cities. Whether the deliberate
segregation and decontamination of numerous cultural institutions from
the ordinary city and ordinary life was part of the cause of Boston's
cultural decline, or whether it was simply a symptom and seal of a
decadence already inevitable from other causes, I do not know. One thing
is sure: Boston's downtown has suffered miserably from lack of good
mixtures in its primary uses, particularly good mixing in of night uses
and of live (not museum-piece and once-upon-a-time) cultural uses.

It is said, by those who have the problem of raising money for large
cultural enterprises, that rich people will contribute much more readily
and heavily for large, decontaminated islands of monuments than for
single cultural buildings set in a city's matrix. This was one of the
rationalizations which resulted in the plans for New York's Lincoln
Center for the Performing Arts. Whether this is true about fund raising
I do not know; it would not be surprising, however, since the well-off
who are also enlightened have been informed by experts for years that
project building is the only worthwhile city building.

Among downtown planners and the businessmen's groups who work with them,
there is a myth (or alibi) that Americans all stay home at night
watching TV or else attend the P-TA meeting. This is what they tell you
in Cincinnati when you ask about their downtown, which is dead by
evening and consequently half-alive by day. Yet Cincinnatians pay some
half-million visits a year to the generally expensive night life across
the river in Covington, Kentucky, which has its own kind of morbid
unbalance. "People []{#calibre_link-1122 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="170"}don't go out," is one of the alibis also used in Pittsburgh
to explain its dead downtown.[\*^4^](#calibre_link-82){#calibre_link-87
.calibre7}

Downtown, the Pittsburgh Parking Authority's garages are operating at
only between 10 and 20 percent of capacity by eight o'clock in the
evening, except for the central Mellon Square garage which may reach 50
percent if something is doing at the hotels. (Like parks and consumer
shops, parking and traffic facilities are innately inefficient and
wasteful without time spread of users.) Meantime, the parking problem
three miles from downtown in a section called Oakland is something
fierce. "No sooner does one crowd move out of that place than another
moves in," explains an Authority official. "It's a headache." It is also
easy to understand. Oakland contains the Pittsburgh symphony, the civic
light opera, the little-theater group, the most fashionable restaurant,
the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, two other major clubs, the main
Carnegie library, museum and art galleries, the Historical Society, the
Shriners' Mosque, the Mellon Institute, a favorite hotel for parties,
the Y.M.H.A., headquarters of the Board of Education, and all the major
hospitals.

Because Oakland contains a high disproportion of leisure-time,
after-work uses, it is unbalanced too, and Pittsburgh has no good place,
either in Oakland or in the working downtown, for generating intensively
its principal metropolitan secondary diversity. The standard stores and
the lowbrow diversity, such as it is, are downtown. What higher-brow
commercial diversity does exist has mostly chosen Oakland as apparently
the better bet of the two places; but it is bloodless and marginal
because Oakland is far from the effective pool of use that a
metropolitan heart should be.

Pittsburgh's instrument for getting into this twofold unbalance was a
real estate operator, the late Frank Nicola, who fifty years ago, in the
City Beautiful era, began promoting a cultural center on the pristine
meadows of a dairy farm. He had a good start because the Carnegie
library and art center had already accepted a gift site from the
Schenley land holdings. Downtown Pittsburgh in those days was not, in
any case, an attractive place for such []{#calibre_link-1126 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="171"}establishments because it was unrelievedly
grim, smoky and sooty.

Now, however, downtown Pittsburgh is potentially attractive for leisure
use, thanks to the massive cleaning up led by the businessmen's
Allegheny Conference. And theoretically, the downtown's one-shift
unbalance should soon be partly remedied by a civic auditorium and the
later addition of a symphony hall and apartments, all immediately
adjoining downtown. But the spirit of the dairy farm and of culture
decontaminated from the city still reigns. Every device---arterial
highways, belts of park, parking lots---severs these projects from the
working downtown, insures that their juncture will remain an abstraction
on maps instead of a living economic reality of people appearing at
different times on the same streets. American downtowns are not
declining mysteriously, because they are anachronisms, nor because their
users have been drained away by automobiles. They are being witlessly
murdered, in good part by deliberate policies of sorting out leisure
uses from work uses, under the misapprehension that this is orderly city
planning.

Primary-use chessmen cannot be strewn hither and yon in a city, of
course, taking into account only the need of spreading people through
time of day, and ignoring the particular needs of the uses
themselves---what will be good locations for *them*.

However, such arbitrariness is unnecessary. I have spoken admiringly
from time to time about the intricate, underlying order of cities. It is
part of the beauty of this order that success for the mixture in itself,
and success for the peculiar and specific elements of the mixture, are
apt to be in harmony rather than contradiction. I have given some
examples of this identity (or correspondence) of interest already in
this chapter, and have touched on others by implication: e.g., the new
work uses planned for lower Manhattan will not only increase that
district's fundamental trouble, but at the same time will burden the new
employees and officials with an economically dull and an inconvenient
city environment. Now I shall give an illustrative example of the quite
complex ill effects that can arise when this innate order of city
vitality is flouted.

We might call this the case of the courts and the opera. Forty-five
[]{#calibre_link-1132 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="172"}years ago,
San Francisco began building a civic center, which has given trouble
ever since. This particular center, placed near the downtown and
intended to pull the downtown toward it, has of course repelled vitality
and gathered around itself instead the blight that typically surrounds
these dead and artificial places. The center includes, among the other
arbitrary objects in its parks, the opera house, the city hall, the
public library and various municipal offices.

Now, considering the opera house and the library as chessmen, how could
they have best helped the city? Each would have been used, separately,
in *close* conjunction with high-intensity downtown offices and shops.
This, and the secondary diversity they would help anchor, would *also*
have been a more congenial environment for either of these two buildings
themselves. The opera, as it is, stands related to nothing, enjoying the
irrelevant convenience of its nearest neighboring facility, the Civil
Service Employment waiting room at the back of City Hall. And the
library, as it is, is the leaning wall of Skid Row.

Unfortunately, in affairs of this kind, one mistake leads on and on. In
1958, a location had to be picked for a criminal courts building. The
logical spot, it was well recognized, would be some place near the other
municipal offices, for the convenience of lawyers and of the services
that attach to lawyers' neighborhoods. But it was also recognized that
the courts building would be bound to catalyze, somewhere in its
vicinity, a secondary diversity of bail-bond houses and un-chic bars.
What to do? Put the courts close to the civic center or in it, so they
would be near some of the buildings with which they need to work? But
the environment of the criminal courts is nothing to encourage near the
opera! The nondescript rattiness nearby is already unsuitable enough.

Every alternative solution to such a ludicrous dilemma must be poor. The
solution chosen was to place the courts at an inconvenient distance, but
the opera was saved from further contaminati on by life other than
"civic," whatever that may mean.

This tiresome muddle arises not in the least from contradictions between
demands by the city as an organism and demands by various specific uses,
nor do most planning muddles arise from any such contradictions. They
arise chiefly from theories which []{#calibre_link-1137 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="173"}are in arbitrary contradiction with *both*
the order of cities and the needs of individual uses.

This point of unsuitable theory---in this case esthetic theory---is so
important and so consistently frustrating in one form and another to
proper city primary mixtures, that I shall pursue the implications of
this case a little further here.

Elbert Peets, an architect who for many years was a consistently
dissenting member of the Washington, D. C., Fine Arts Commission, has
stated the conflict well, and although he is speaking of Washington his
remarks apply to this trouble in San Francisco and to troubles in many
other places too:

Here, one might say offhand, are two opposed esthetic visions, a matter
of taste, and who can quarrel with taste? But this goes deeper than
taste. One of these visions---the sorted-out "courts of
honor"---contradicts the functional and economic needs of cities and of
their specific uses too. The other vision---the mingled city
[]{#calibre_link-1144 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="174"}with
individual architectural focal points intimately surrounded by the
everyday matrix---is in harmony with the economic and other functional
behavior of cities.[\*^5^](#calibre_link-83){#calibre_link-88 .calibre7}

Every city primary use, whether it comes in monumental and special guise
or not, needs its intimate matrix of "profane" city to work to best
advantage. The courts building in San Francisco needs one kind of matrix
with its secondary diversity. The opera needs another kind of matrix
with its secondary diversity. And the matrices of the city need these
uses themselves, for the influence of their presence helps form a city's
matrices. Furthermore, a city matrix needs its own less spectacular
internal minglings ("jumbles" to the simple-minded). Else it is not a
matrix but, like housing projects, it is "profane" monotony, working no
more sensibly than the "sacred" monotony of civic centers like San
Francisco's.

To be sure, any principle can be applied arbitrarily and destructively
by people who fail to understand its workings. L'Enfant's esthetic
theory of focal points interdependent with the everyday city matrix
surrounding them could be applied by trying to strew primary
uses---especially those capable of monumental appearance---without
regard for the economic or other working relationships that they
require. But L'Enfant's theory is admirable, not as an abstract visual
good in isolation from function, but rather because it is capable of
being applied and adapted in harmony with the needs of real
establishments in real cities. If these functional needs are considered
and respected, esthetic theories that glorify sorted-out and isolated
uses, either "sacred" or "profane," are impossible to apply.

In city districts that are predominately or heavily residential, the
more complexity and variety of primary uses that can be cultivated, the
better, just as in downtowns. But the chief chessman that is needed in
these districts is the primary use of work. As []{#calibre_link-1149
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="175"}we have seen in the examples of
the park at Rittenhouse Square, or Hudson Street, these two primary uses
can dovetail nicely with one another, the streets livening up with
workers at midday when they go dead from the dwellings, livening up from
the dwellings in the evening when they go dead from the work.

The desirability of segregating dwellings from work has been so dinned
into us that it takes an effort to look at real life and observe that
residential districts lacking mixture with work do not fare well in
cities. In an article on Negro ghettos by Harry S. Ashmore in the *New
York Herald Tribune*, a Harlem political leader was quoted as saying,
"The whites are likely to ease back in here, and take Harlem away from
us. After all, \[Harlem is\] the most attractive piece of real estate in
the whole area. We've got hills and views of both rivers, and
transportation is good, and it's the only close-in area that doesn't
have any industry."

Only in planning theory does this make Harlem an "attractive piece of
real estate." From the time of its white middle- and upper-class
beginnings, Harlem never was a workable, economically vigorous
residential district of a city, and it probably never will be, no matter
who lives there, until it gets, among other physical improvements, a
good, healthy mixture of work stirred alongside and among its stretches
of dwellings.

Primary work uses in residential districts cannot be produced by wishing
for them, any more than secondary diversity can be. Public policy can do
relatively little that is positive to get working uses woven in where
they are absent and needed in cities, other than to *permit* and
indirectly encourage them.

But attempts at positive lures are not the most pressing first need in
any case, nor the most fruitful way to spend efforts in gray areas that
need vitality. The first problem is to make the most of any work and
other primary-use chessmen where they already do exist in failing
residential districts. The sample-shoe market in Louisville, although it
is a strange example, cries out for such opportunism. Much of the
borough of Brooklyn does, and some of the Bronx, and indeed, inner gray
areas in almost all big cities.

How do you use the existing presence of working places
opportunistically, and build from this? How do you weld them in to
[]{#calibre_link-1155 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="176"}help form,
with dwellings, effective pools of street use? Here we must make a
distinction between the typical downtown and the usual residential
district in trouble. In downtowns, lack of sufficient primary mixture is
usually the most serious basic handicap. In most residential districts,
and especially most gray areas, lack of primary mixture is usually only
one handicap, and sometimes not the most severe. Indeed, it is easy to
find instances in which work is mixed with dwellings, yet to little
avail in helping *generate* diversity or vigor. This is because most
city residential districts also have blocks that are too large, or they
were built up all at once and have never overcome this original handicap
even as their buildings have aged, or very commonly they lack sufficient
population in sheer numbers. In short, they are deficient in several of
the four conditions for generating diversity.

Instead of worrying about where enough work is to come from, the first
problem is to identify where, in residential districts, it does exist
and is being wasted as an element of primary use. In cities you have to
build from existing assets, to make more assets. To think how to make
the most of work and dwelling mixtures, where they exist or give promise
of existing, it is necessary to understand the parts played by the three
other generators of diversity too.

However, I shall anticipate the discussion in the next three chapters to
say this: Of the four generators of diversity, two represent easy
problems to deal with in curing the troubles of gray areas---aged
buildings are usually already present to do their potential share; and
additional streets where they are needed are not innately difficult to
acquire. (They are a minor problem compared with the large-scale land
clearance we have been taught to waste our money on.)

The two other necessary conditions, however---mixtures of primary
diversity and sufficient concentration of dwellings---are more difficult
to create if they are lacking. The sensible thing is to begin where at
least *one* of these two conditions already exists or can be fostered
relatively easily.

The hardest city districts to deal with will be residential gray areas
that lack infusions of work to build upon, and that also lack high
densities of dwellings. Failing or failed city areas are in
[]{#calibre_link-1160 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="177"}trouble not
so much because of what they have (which can always be regarded as a
base to build upon), but because of what they lack. Gray areas with the
most severe and the most difficult-to-supply lacks can hardly be helped
toward vigor unless other gray-area districts that do have at least a
start toward primary mixture are nurtured, and unless downtowns are
reinvigorated with better spread of people through time of day. The more
successfully a city generates diversity and vitality in any of its
parts, of course, the better become its chances for building success,
ultimately, in still other parts---including, eventually, those most
discouraging to begin with.

It should go without saying that streets or districts which do have good
primary mixtures and are successful at generating city diversity should
be treasured, rather than despised for their mixture and destroyed by
attempts to sort out their components from one another. But
unfortunately, conventional planners seem to see in just such popular
and attractive places only an irresistible invitation to employ the
destructive and simple-minded purposes of orthodox city planning. Given
enough federal funds and enough power, planners can easily destroy city
primary mixtures faster than these can grow in unplanned districts, so
that there is a net loss of basic primary mixture. Indeed, this is
happening today.

::: {#calibre_link-1162 .footnote}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\*^1^](#calibre_link-84){.calibre7} Please remember, however, that this
factor of users spread through time of day is only one of four necessary
factors for generating diversity. Do not think it explains everything by
itself, even though it is an essential factor.

[\*^2^](#calibre_link-85){.calibre7} Shopping centers that serve only
residential primary use, for example, have a trouble similar to that of
lower Manhattan, but in reverse so far as time is concerned. Thus many
such shopping centers have been closing up in the mornings and staying
open in the evenings. "The way things are now," said a shopping center
executive quoted in the *New York Times*, "you could shoot a cannon down
the mall of any shopping center at midday and not hit a soul." The
innate inefficiency of serving a single primary use is one reason (in
combination with several others) why so few shopping centers are able to
support any but standardized, high-turnover enterprises.

[\*^3^](#calibre_link-86){.calibre7} This process can go to extremes and
destroy itself, but that is another aspect of the question, which I
shall deal with in Part III of this book. We can ignore it for the time
being.

[\*^4^](#calibre_link-87){.calibre7} The other alibi, offered rather
proudly by businessmen, is that "We've got a downtown something like
Wall Street." Apparently they haven't heard Wall Street's neighborhood
news about its difficulties.

[\*^5^](#calibre_link-88){.calibre7} The New York Public Library at
Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street is an example of such an
architectural focal point; the old Jefferson Market Courthouse in the
center of Greenwich Village is another. Every reader, I am sure is
familiar with individual monumental focal points in a city matrix.

The advantages of short blocks are simple.

Consider, for instance, the situation of a man living on a long street
block, such as West Eighty-eighth Street in Manhattan, between Central
Park West and Columbus Avenue. He goes westward along his 800-foot block
to reach the stores on Columbus Avenue or take the bus, and he goes
eastward to reach the park, take the subway or another bus. He may very
well never enter the adjacent blocks on Eighty-seventh Street and
Eighty-ninth Street for years.

This brings grave trouble. We have already seen that isolated, discrete
street neighborhoods are apt to be helpless socially. This man would
have every justification for disbelieving that Eighty-seventh and
Eighty-ninth streets or their people have anything to
[]{#calibre_link-1172 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="179"}do with
him. To believe it, he has to go beyond the ordinary evidence of his
everyday life.

So far as his neighborhood is concerned, the *economic* effect of these
self-isolating streets is equally constricting. The people on this
street, and the people on the adjacent streets can form a pool of
economic use only where their long, separated paths meet and come
together in one stream. In this case, the nearest place where that can
happen is Columbus Avenue.

And because Columbus Avenue is the only nearby place where tens of
thousands of people from these stagnant, long, backwater
[]{#calibre_link-1177 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="180"}blocks meet
and form a pool of use, Columbus Avenue has its own kind of
monotony---endless stores and a depressing predominance of commercial
standardization. In this neighborhood there is geographically so little
street frontage on which commerce can live, that it must all be
consolidated, regardless of its type or the scale of support it needs or
the scale of convenience (distance from users) that is natural to it.
Around about stretch the dismally long strips of monotony and
darkness---the Great Blight of Dullness, with an abrupt garish gash at
long intervals. This is a typical arrangement for areas of city failure.

This stringent physical segregation of the regular users of one street
from the regular users of the next holds, of course, for visitors too.
For instance, I have been going to a dentist on West Eighty-sixth Street
just off Columbus Avenue for more than fifteen years. In all that time,
although I have ranged north and south on Columbus, and north and south
on Central Park West, I have never used West Eighty-fifth Street or West
Eighty-seventh Street. It would be both inconvenient and pointless to do
so. If I take the children, after the dentist, to the planetarium on
West Eighty-first Street between Columbus and Central Park West, there
is only one possible direct route: down Columbus and then into
Eighty-first.

Let us consider, instead, the situation if these long east-west blocks
had an extra street cut across them---not a sterile "promenade" of the
kind in which super-block projects abound, but a street containing
buildings where things could start up and grow at spots economically
viable: places for buying, eating, seeing things, getting a drink. With
the extra street, the Eighty-eighth Street man would no longer need to
walk a monotonous, al-ways-the-same path to a given point. He would have
various alternative routes to choose. The neighborhood would literally
have opened up to him.

The same would be true of people living on other streets, and for those
nearer Columbus heading toward a point in the park or toward the subway.
Instead of mutual isolation of paths, these paths would now be mixed and
mingled with one another.

The supply of feasible spots for commerce would increase considerably,
and so could the distribution and convenience of their
[]{#calibre_link-1184 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="181"}placement.
If among the people on West Eighty-eighth there are a third enough
people to support a newspaper and neighborhood oddment place somewhat
like Bernie's around the corner from us, and the same might be said of
Eighty-seventh and Eighty-ninth, now there would be a possibility that
they might do so around one of their additional corners. As long as
these people can never pool their support nearby except in one stream
only, such distribution of services, economic opportunity and public
life is an impossibility.

In the case of these long blocks, even people who are present in the
neighborhood for the same primary reasons are kept too much apart to
permit them to form reasonably intricate pools of city cross-use. Where
differing primary uses are involved, long blocks are apt to thwart
effective mixture in exactly the same way. They automatically sort
people into paths that meet too infrequently, so that different uses
very near each other geographically are, in practical effect, literally
blocked off from one another.

To contrast the stagnation of these long blocks with the fluidity of use
that an extra street could bring is not a far-fetched supposition. An
example of such a transformation can be seen at Rockefeller Center,
which occupies three of the long blocks between Fifth and Sixth avenues.
Rockefeller Center has that extra street.

I ask those readers who are familiar with it to imagine it without
[]{#calibre_link-1190 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="182"}its extra
north-south street, Rockefeller Plaza. If the center's buildings were
continuous along each of its side streets all the way from Fifth to
Sixth Avenue, it would no longer be a center of use. It could not be. It
would be a group of self-isolated streets pooling only at Fifth and
Sixth avenues. The most artful design in other respects could not tie it
together, because it is fluidity of use, and the mixing of paths, not
homogeneity of architecture, that ties together city neighborhoods into
pools of city use, whether those neighborhoods are predominately for
work or predominately for residence.

To the north, Rockefeller Center's street fluidity extends in diminished
form, as far as Fifty-third Street, because of a block-through lobby and
an arcade that people use as a further extension of the street. To the
south, its fluidity as a pool of use ends abruptly along Forty-eighth
Street. The next street down, Forty-seventh, is self-isolated. It is
largely a wholesaling street (the center of gem wholesaling), a
surprisingly marginal use for a []{#calibre_link-1194 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="183"}street that lies geographically next to one
of the city's greatest attractions. But just like the users of
Eighty-seventh and Eighty-eighth streets, the users of Forty-seventh and
Forty-eighth streets can go for years without ever mixing into one
another's streets.

Long blocks, in their nature, thwart the potential advantages that
cities offer to incubation, experimentation, and many small or special
enterprises, insofar as these depend upon drawing their customers or
clients from among much larger cross-sections of passing public. Long
blocks also thwart the principle that if city mixtures of use are to be
more than a fiction on maps, they must result in different people, bent
on different purposes, appearing at different times, but using the
*same* streets.

Of all the hundreds of long blocks in Manhattan, a bare eight or ten are
spontaneously enlivening with time or exerting magnetism.

It is instructive to watch where the overflow of diversity and
popularity from Greenwich Village has spilled and where it has halted.
Rents have steadily gone up in Greenwich Village, and predictors have
regularly been predicting, for at least twenty-five years now, a
renascence of once fashionable Chelsea directly to the north. This
prediction may seem logical because of Chelsea's location, because its
mixtures and types of buildings and densities of dwelling units per acre
are almost identical with those of Greenwich Village, and also because
it even has a mixture of work with its dwellings. But the renascence has
never happened. Instead, Chelsea languishes behind its barriers of long,
self-isolating blocks, decaying in most of them faster than it is
rehabilitated in others. Today it is being extensively slum-cleared, and
in the process endowed with even bigger and more monotonous blocks. (The
pseudoscience of planning seems almost neurotic in its determination to
imitate empiric failure and ignore empiric success.) Meantime, Greenwich
Village has extended itself and its diversity and popularity far to the
east, working outward through a little neck between industrial
concentrations, following unerringly the direction of short blocks and
fluid street use---even though the buildings in that direction are not
so attractive or seemingly suitable as those in Chelsea. This movement
in one direction and halt in another is neither capricious nor
mysterious nor "a chaotic accident." []{#calibre_link-1198 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="184"}It is a down-to-earth response to what
works well economically for city diversity and what does not.

Another perennial "mystery" raised in New York is why the removal of the
elevated railway along Sixth Avenue on the West Side stimulated so
little change and added so little to popularity, and why the removal of
the elevated railway along Third Avenue on the East Side stimulated so
much change and added so greatly to popularity. But long blocks have
made an economic monstrosity of the West Side, the more so because they
occur toward the center of the island, precisely where the West Side's
most effective pools of use would and should form, had they a chance.
Short blocks occur on the East Side toward the center of the island,
exactly where the most effective pools of use have had the best chance
of forming and extending
themselves.[\*](#calibre_link-89){#calibre_link-90 .calibre7}

Theoretically, almost all the short side streets of the East Side in the
Sixties, Seventies and Eighties are residential only. It is instructive
to notice how frequently and how nicely special shops like bookstores or
dressmakers or restaurants have inserted themselves, usually, but not
always, near the corners. The equivalent West Side does not support
bookstores and never did. This is not because its successive
discontented and deserting populations all had an aversion to reading
nor because they were too poor to buy books. On the contrary the West
Side is full of intellectuals and always has been. It is probably as
good a "natural" market for books as Greenwich Village and possibly a
better "natural" market than the East Side. Because of its long blocks,
the West Side has never been physically capable of forming the intricate
pools of fluid street use necessary to support urban diversity.

[]{#calibre_link-1202 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="185"}A reporter
for the *New Yorker*, observing that people *try* to find an extra
north-south passage in the too-long blocks between Fifth and Sixth
avenues, once attempted to see if he could amalgamate a makeshift
mid-block trail from Thirty-third Street to Rockefeller Center. He
discovered reasonable, if erratic, means for short-cutting through nine
of the blocks, owing to block-through stores and lobbies and Bryant Park
behind the Forty-second Street Library. But he was reduced to wiggling
under fences or clambering through windows or coaxing superintendents,
to get through four of the blocks, and had to evade the issue by going
into subway passages for two.

In city districts that become successful or magnetic, streets are
virtually never made to disappear. Quite the contrary. Where it is
possible, they multiply. Thus in the Rittenhouse Square district of
Philadelphia and in Georgetown in the District of Columbia, what were
once back alleys down the centers of blocks have become streets with
buildings fronting on them, and users using them like streets. In
Philadelphia, they often include commerce.

Nor do long blocks possess more virtue in other cities than they do in
New York. In Philadelphia there is a neighborhood in which buildings are
simply being let fall down by their owners, in an area between the
downtown and the city's major belt of public housing projects. There are
many reasons for this neighborhood's hopelessness, including the
nearness of the rebuilt city with its social disintegration and danger,
but obviously the neighborhood has not been helped by its own physical
structure. The standard Philadelphia block is 400 feet square (halved by
the alleys-become-streets where the city is most successful). In this
falling-down neighborhood some of that "street waste" was eliminated in
the original street layout; its blocks are 700 feet long. It stagnated,
of course, beginning from the time it was built up. In Boston, the North
End, which is a marvel of "wasteful" streets and fluidity of cross-use,
has been heroically unslumming itself against official apathy and
financial opposition.

The myth that plentiful city streets are "wasteful," one of the verities
of orthodox planning, comes of course from the Garden City and Radiant
City theorists who decried the use of land for streets because they
wanted that land consolidated instead into []{#calibre_link-1206
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="186"}project prairies. This myth is
especially destructive because it interferes intellectually with our
ability to see one of the simplest, most unnecessary, and most easily
corrected reasons for much stagnation and failure.

Super-block projects are apt to have all the disabilities of long
blocks, frequently in exaggerated form, and this is true even when they
are laced with promenades and malls, and thus, in theory, possess
streets at reasonable intervals through which people can make their way.
These streets are meaningless because there is seldom any active reason
for a good cross-section of people to use them. Even in passive terms,
simply as various alternative changes of scene in getting from here to
yonder, these paths are meaningless because all their scenes are
essentially the same. The situation is the opposite from that the *New
Yorker* reporter noticed in the blocks between Fifth and Sixth avenues.
There people try to hunt out streets which they need but which are
missing. In projects, people are apt to avoid malls and cross-malls
which are there, but are pointless.

I bring up this problem not merely to berate the anomalies of project
planning again, but to indicate that frequent streets and short blocks
are valuable because of the fabric of intricate cross-use that they
permit among the users of a city neighborhood. Frequent streets are not
an end in themselves. They are a means toward an end. If that
end---generating diversity and catalyzing the plans of many people
besides planners---is thwarted by too repressive zoning, or by
regimented construction that precludes the flexible growth of diversity,
nothing significant can be accomplished by short blocks. Like mixtures
of primary use, frequent streets are effective in helping to generate
diversity *only because of the way they perform.* The means by which
they work (attracting mixtures of users along them) and the results they
can help accomplish (the growth of diversity) are inextricably related.
The relationship is reciprocal.

# The need for aged buildings {#calibre_link-1214 .chaphead1}
:::

> [CONDITION]{.x-small} 3: *The district must mingle buildings that vary
> in age and condition, including a good proportion of old ones*.

Cities need old buildings so badly it is probably impossible for
vigorous streets and districts to grow without them. By old buildings I
mean not museum-piece old buildings, not old buildings in an excellent
and expensive state of rehabilitation---although these make fine
ingredients---but also a good lot of plain, ordinary, low-value old
buildings, including some rundown old buildings.

If a city area has only new buildings, the enterprises that can exist
there are automatically limited to those that can support the high costs
of new construction. These high costs of occupying new buildings may be
levied in the form of rent, or they may be levied in the form of an
owner's interest and amortization payments on the capital costs of the
construction. However the []{#calibre_link-1218 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="188"}costs are paid off, they have to be paid
off. And for this reason, enterprises that support the cost of new
construction must be capable of paying a relatively high overhead---high
in comparison to that necessarily required by old buildings. To support
such high overheads, the enterprises must be either (a) high profit or
(b) well subsidized.

If you look about, you will see that only operations that are well
established, high-turnover, standardized or heavily subsidized can
afford, commonly, to carry the costs of new construction. Chain stores,
chain restaurants and banks go into new construction. But neighborhood
bars, foreign restaurants and pawn shops go into older buildings.
Supermarkets and shoe stores often go into new buildings; good
bookstores and antique dealers seldom do. Well-subsidized opera and art
museums often go into new buildings. But the unformalized feeders of the
arts---studios, galleries, stores for musical instruments and art
supplies, backrooms where the low earning power of a seat and a table
can absorb uneconomic discussions---these go into old buildings. Perhaps
more significant, hundreds of ordinary enterprises, necessary to the
safety and public life of streets and neighborhoods, and appreciated for
their convenience and personal quality, can make out successfully in old
buildings, but are inexorably slain by the high overhead of new
construction.

As for really new ideas of any kind---no matter how ultimately
profitable or otherwise successful some of them might prove to
be---there is no leeway for such chancy trial, error and experimentation
in the high-overhead economy of new construction. Old ideas can
sometimes use new buildings. New ideas must use old buildings.

Even the enterprises that can support new construction in cities need
old construction in their immediate vicinity. Otherwise they are part of
a total attraction and total environment that is economically too
limited---and therefore functionally too limited to be lively,
interesting and convenient. Flourishing diversity anywhere in a city
means the mingling of high-yield, middling-yield, low-yield and no-yield
enterprises.

The only harm of aged buildings to a city district or street is the harm
that eventually comes of *nothing but* old age---the harm
[]{#calibre_link-1223 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="189"}that lies
in everything being old and everything becoming worn out. But a city
area in such a situation is not a failure because of being all old. It
is the other way around. The area is all old because it is a failure.
For some other reason or combination of reasons, all its enterprises or
people are unable to support new construction. It has, perhaps, failed
to hang on to its own people or enterprises that do become successful
enough to support new building or rehabilitation; they leave when they
become this successful. It has also failed to attract newcomers with
choice; they see no opportunities or attractions here. And in some
cases, such an area may be so infertile economically that enterprises
which might grow into successes in other places, and build or rebuild
their shelter, never make enough money in this place to do
so.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-91){#calibre_link-98 .calibre7}

A successful city district becomes a kind of ever-normal granary so far
as construction is concerned. Some of the old buildings, year by year,
are replaced by new ones---or rehabilitated to a degree equivalent to
replacement. Over the years there is, therefore, constantly a mixture of
buildings of many ages and types. This is, of course, a dynamic process,
with what was once new in the mixture eventually becoming what is old in
the mixture.

We are dealing here again, as we were in the case of mixed primary uses,
with the economic effects of time. But in this case we are dealing with
the economics of time not hour by hour through the day, but with the
economics of time by decades and generations.

Time makes the high building costs of one generation the bargains of a
following generation. Time pays off original capital costs, and this
depreciation can be reflected in the yields required from a building.
Time makes certain structures obsolete for some enterprises, and they
become available to others. Time can make []{#calibre_link-1227
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="190"}the space efficiencies of one
generation the space luxuries of another generation. One century's
building commonplace is another century's useful aberration.

The economic necessity for old buildings mixed with new is not an oddity
connected with the precipitous rise in building costs since the war, and
especially throughout the 1950's. To be sure, the difference between the
yield most postwar building must bring and the yield that pre-Depression
buildings must bring is especially sharp. In commercial space, the
difference between carrying costs per square foot can be as much as 100
or 200 percent, even though the older buildings may be better built than
the new, and even though the maintenance costs of all buildings,
including old ones, have risen. Old buildings were a necessary
ingredient of city diversity back in the 1920's and the 1890's. Old
buildings will still be a necessity when today's new buildings are the
old ones. This has been, still is, and will be, true no matter how
erratic or how steady construction costs themselves are, because a
depreciated building requires less income than one which has not yet
paid off its capital costs. Steadily rising construction costs simply
accentuate the need for old buildings. Possibly they also make necessary
a higher *proportion* of old buildings in the total street or district
mixture, because rising building costs raise the general threshold of
pecuniary success required to support the costs of new construction.

A few years ago, I gave a talk at a city design conference about the
social need for commercial diversity in cities. Soon my words began
coming back at me from designers, planners and students in the form of a
slogan (which I certainly did not invent): "We must leave room for the
corner grocery store!"

At first I thought this must be a figure of speech, the part standing
for the whole. But soon I began to receive in the mail plans and
drawings for projects and renewal areas in which, literally, room had
been left here and there at great intervals for a corner grocery store.
These schemes were accompanied by letters that said, "See, we have taken
to heart what you said."

This corner-grocery gimmick is a thin, patronizing conception
[]{#calibre_link-1233 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="191"}of city
diversity, possibly suited to a village of the last century, but hardly
to a vital city district of today. Lone little groceries, in fact, do
badly in cities as a rule. They are typically a mark of stagnant and
undiverse gray area.

Nevertheless, the designers of these sweetly meant inanities were not
simply being perverse. They were doing, probably, the best they could
under the economic conditions set for them. A suburban-type shopping
center at some place in the project, and this wan spotting of corner
groceries, were the most that could be hoped for. For these were schemes
contemplating either great blankets of new construction, or new
construction combined with extensive, prearranged rehabilitation. Any
vigorous range of diversity was precluded in advance by the consistently
high overhead. (The prospects are made still poorer by insufficient
primary mixtures of uses and therefore insufficient spread of customers
through the day.)

Even the lone groceries, if they were ever
built,[\*^1^](#calibre_link-92){#calibre_link-97 .calibre7} could hardly
be the cozy enterprises envisioned by their designers. To carry their
high overhead, they must either be (a) subsidized---by whom and
why?---or (b) converted into routinized, high-turnover mills.

Large swatches of construction built at one time are inherently
inefficient for sheltering wide ranges of cultural, population, and
business diversity. They are even inefficient for sheltering much range
of mere commercial diversity. This can be seen at a place like
Stuyvesant Town in New York. In 1959, more than a decade after operation
began, of the 32 store fronts that comprise Stuyvesant Town's commercial
space, seven were either empty or were being used uneconomically (for
storage, window advertising only, and the like). This represented disuse
or underuse of 22 percent of the fronts. At the same time, across the
bordering streets, where buildings of every age and condition are
mingled, were 140 store fronts, of which 11 were empty or used
uneconomically, representing a disuse or underuse of only 7 percent.
Actually, the disparity is greater than this would appear, because
[]{#calibre_link-1237 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="192"}the empty
fronts in the old streets were mostly small, and in linear feet
represented less than 7 percent, a condition which was not true of the
project stores. The good business side of the street is the age-mingled
side, even though a great share of its customers are Stuyvesant Town
people, and even though they must cross wide and dangerous traffic
arteries to reach it. This reality is acknowledged by the chain stores
and supermarkets too, which have been building new quarters in the
age-mingled setting instead of filling those empty fronts in the
project.

One-age construction in city areas is sometimes protected nowadays from
the threat of more efficient and responsive commercial competition. This
protection---which is nothing more or less than commercial monopoly---is
considered very "progressive" in planning circles. The Society Hill
renewal plan for Philadelphia will, by zoning, prevent competition to
its developer's shopping centers throughout a whole city district. The
city's planners have also worked out a "food plan" for the area, which
means offering a monopolistic restaurant concession to a single
restaurant chain for the whole district. Nobody else's food allowed! The
Hyde Park-Kenwood renewal district of Chicago reserves a monopoly on
almost all commerce for a suburban-type shopping center to be the
property of that plan's principal developer. In the huge Southwest
redevelopment district of Washington, the major housing developer seems
to be going so far as to eliminate competition with himself. The
original plans for this scheme contemplated a central, suburban-type
shopping center plus a smattering of convenience stores---our old
friend, the lonely corner grocery gimmick. A shopping center economist
predicted that these convenience stores might lead to diminished
business for the main, suburban-type center which, itself, will have to
support high overhead. To protect it, the convenience stores were
dropped from the scheme. It is thus that routinized monopolistic
packages of substitute city are palmed off as "planned shopping."

Monopoly planning can make financial successes of such inherently
inefficient and stagnant one-age operations. But it cannot thereby
create, in some magical fashion, an equivalent to city diversity. Nor
can it substitute for the inherent efficiency, in cities, of mingled age
and inherently varied overhead.

[]{#calibre_link-1241 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="193"}Age of
buildings, in relation to usefulness or desirability, is an extremely
relative thing. Nothing in a vital city district seems to be too old to
be chosen for use by those who have choice---or to have its place taken,
finally, by something new. And this usefulness of the old is not simply
a matter of architectural distinction or charm. In the
Back-of-the-Yards, Chicago, no weather-beaten, undistinguished,
run-down, presumably obsolete frame house seems to be too far gone to
lure out savings and to instigate borrowing---because this is a
neighborhood that people are not leaving as they achieve enough success
for choice. In Greenwich Village, almost no old building is scorned by
middle-class families hunting a bargain in a lively district, or by
rehabilitators seeking a golden egg. In successful districts, old
buildings "filter up."

At the other extreme, in Miami Beach, where novelty is the sovereign
remedy, hotels ten years old are considered aged and are passed up
because others are newer. Newness, and its superficial gloss of
well-being, is a very perishable commodity.

Many city occupants and enterprises have no need for new construction.
The floor of the building in which this book is being written is
occupied also by a health club with a gym, a firm of ecclesiastical
decorators, an insurgent Democratic party reform club, a Liberal party
political club, a music society, an accordionists' association, a
retired importer who sells maté by mail, a man who sells paper and who
also takes care of shipping the maté, a dental laboratory, a studio for
watercolor lessons, and a maker of costume jewelry. Among the tenants
who were here and gone shortly before I came in, were a man who rented
out tuxedos, a union local and a Haitian dance troupe. There is no place
for the likes of us in new construction. And the last thing we need is
new construction. What we need, and a lot of others need, is old
construction in a lively district, which some among us can help make
livelier.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-93){#calibre_link-99 .calibre7}

Nor is new residential building in cities an unadulterated good. Many
disadvantages accompany new residential city building; and
[]{#calibre_link-1245 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="194"}the value
placed on various advantages, or the penalties accruing from certain
disadvantages, are given different weights by different people. Some
people, for instance, prefer more space for the money (or equal space
for less money) to a new dinette designed for midgets. Some people like
walls they don't hear
through.[\*^4^](#calibre_link-94){#calibre_link-100 .calibre7} This is
an advantage they can get with many old buildings but not with new
apartments, whether they are public housing at \$14 a room per month or
luxury housing at \$95 a room per month. Some people would rather pay
for improvements in their living conditions partly in labor and
ingenuity, and by selecting which improvements are most important to
them, instead of being indiscriminately improved, and all at a cost of
money. In spontaneously unslumming slums, where people are staying by
choice, it is easy to observe how many ordinary citizens have heard of
color, lighting and furnishing devices for converting deep or dismal
spaces into pleasant and useful rooms, have heard of bedroom
air-conditioning and of electric window fans, have learned about taking
out non-bearing partitions, and have even learned about throwing two too
small flats into one. Minglings of old buildings, with consequent
minglings in living costs and tastes, are essential to get diversity and
stability in residential populations, as well as diversity in
enterprises.

Among the most admirable and enjoyable sights to be found along the
sidewalks of big cities are the ingenious adaptations of old quarters to
new uses. The town-house parlor that becomes a craftsman's showroom, the
stable that becomes a house, the basement that becomes an immigrants'
club, the garage or brewery that becomes a theater, the beauty parlor
that becomes the ground floor of a duplex, the warehouse that becomes a
factory for Chinese food, the dancing school that becomes a pamphlet
printer's, the cobbler's that becomes a church with lovingly painted
windows---the stained glass of the poor---the butcher shop that becomes
a restaurant: these are the kinds of minor changes []{#calibre_link-1247
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="195"}forever occurring where city
districts have vitality and are responsive to human needs.

Consider the history of the no-yield space that has recently been
rehabilitated by the Arts in Louisville Association as a theater, music
room, art gallery, library, bar and restaurant. It started life as a
fashionable athletic club, outlived that and became a school, then the
stable of a dairy company, then a riding school, then a finishing and
dancing school, another athletic club, an artist's studio, a school
again, a blacksmith's, a factory, a warehouse, and it is now a
flourishing center of the arts. Who could anticipate or provide for such
a succession of hopes and schemes? Only an unimaginative man would think
he could; only an arrogant man would want to.

These eternal changes and permutations among old city buildings can be
called makeshifts only in the most pedantic sense. It is rather that a
form of raw material has been found in the right place. It has been put
to a use that might otherwise be unborn.

What is makeshift and woebegone is to see city diversity outlawed.
Outside the vast, middle-income Bronx project of Parkchester, where the
standardized, routinized commerce (with its share of empty fronts) is
protected from unauthorized competition or augmentation within the
project, we can see such an outcast huddle, supported by Parkchester
people. Beyond a corner of the project, hideously clumped on a stretch
of pocked asphalt left over from a gas station, are a few of the other
things the project people apparently need: quick loans, musical
instruments, camera exchange, Chinese restaurant, odd-lot clothing. How
many other needs remain unfilled? What is wanted becomes academic when
mingled building age is replaced by the economic rigor mortis of one-age
construction, with its inherent inefficiency and consequent need for
forms of "protectionism."

Cities need a mingling of old buildings to cultivate primary-diversity
mixtures, as well as secondary diversity. In particular, they need old
buildings to incubate new primary diversity.

If the incubation is successful enough, the yield of the buildings can,
and often does, rise. Grady Clay reports that this is already
observable, for instance, in the Louisville sample-shoe market.
[]{#calibre_link-1254 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="196"}"Rents were
very low when the market began to attract shoppers," he says. "For a
shop about twenty feet by forty feet, they were \$25 to \$50 a month.
They have already gone up to about \$75." Many a city's enterprises
which become important economic assets start small and poor, and become
able, eventually, to afford carrying costs of rehabilitation or new
construction. But this process could not occur without that low-yield
space in the right place, in which to start.

Areas where better mixtures of primary diversity must be cultivated will
have to depend heavily on old buildings, especially at the beginning of
deliberate attempts to catalyze diversity. If Brooklyn, New York, as an
example, is ever to cultivate the quantity of diversity and degree of
attraction and liveliness it needs, it must take maximum economic
advantage of combinations of residence and work. Without these primary
combinations, in effective and concentrated proportions, it is hard to
see how Brooklyn can begin to catalyze its potential for secondary
diversity.

Brooklyn cannot well compete with suburbs for capturing big and
well-established manufacturers seeking a location. At least it cannot at
present, certainly not by trying to beat out the suburbs at *their*
game, on their terms. Brooklyn has quite different assets. If Brooklyn
is to make the most of work-residence primary mixtures, it must depend
mainly on incubating work enterprises, and then holding on to them as
long as it can. While it has them, it must combine them with
sufficiently high concentrations of residential population, and with
short blocks, to make the most of their presence. The more it makes of
their presence, the more firmly it is apt to hold work uses.

But to incubate those work uses, Brooklyn needs old buildings, needs
them for exactly the task they fulfill there. For Brooklyn is quite an
incubator. Each year, more manufacturing enterprises leave Brooklyn for
other locations than move into Brooklyn from elsewhere. Yet the number
of factories in Brooklyn has been constantly growing. A thesis prepared
by three students at Brooklyn's Pratt
Institute[\*^5^](#calibre_link-95){#calibre_link-101 .calibre7} explains
this paradox well:

[]{#calibre_link-1259 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="197"}The secret
is that Brooklyn is an incubator of industry. Small businesses are
constantly being started there. A couple of machinists, perhaps, will
get tired of working for someone else and start out for themselves in
the back of a garage. They'll prosper and grow; soon they will get too
big for the garage and move to a rented loft; still later they buy a
building. When they outgrow that, and have to build for themselves,
there is a good chance they will move out to Queens, or Nassau or New
Jersey. But in the meantime, twenty or fifty or a hundred more like them
will have started up.

::: {#calibre_link-1260 .section_break}

Why do they move when they build for themselves? For one thing, Brooklyn
offers too few attractions aside from those a new industry finds are
necessities---old buildings and nearness to the wide range of other
skills and supplies a small enterprise must have. For another, little or
no effort has been made to plan for working needs---e.g., great sums of
money are spent on highways choked with private automobiles rushing into
the city and out of it; no comparable thought or money is spent on
trucking expressways for manufacturers who use the city's old buildings,
its docks and its railways.[\*^6^](#calibre_link-96){#calibre_link-102
.calibre7}

Brooklyn, like most of our city areas in decline, has more old buildings
than it needs. To put it another way, many of its neighborhoods have for
a long time lacked gradual increments of new buildings. Yet if Brooklyn
is ever to build upon its inherent assets and advantages---which is the
only way successful city []{#calibre_link-1263 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="198"}building can be done---many of those old
buildings, well distributed, will be essential to the process.
Improvement must come by supplying the conditions for generating
diversity that are missing, not by wiping out old buildings in great
swathes.

::: {#calibre_link-1264 .section_break}

We can see around us, from the days preceding project building, many
examples of decaying city neighborhoods built up all at once. Frequently
such neighborhoods have begun life as fashionable areas; sometimes they
have had instead a solid middle-class start. Every city has such
physically homogeneous neighborhoods.

Usually just such neighborhoods have been handicapped in every way, so
far as generating diversity is concerned, We cannot blame their poor
staying power and stagnation entirely on their most obvious misfortune:
being built all at once. Nevertheless, this is one of the handicaps of
such neighborhoods, and unfortunately its effects can persist long after
the buildings have become aged.

When such an area is new, it offers no economic possibilities to city
diversity. The practical penalties of dullness, from this and other
causes, stamp the neighborhood early. It becomes a place to leave. By
the time the buildings have indeed aged, their only useful city
attribute is low value, which by itself is not enough.

Neighborhoods built up all at once change little physically over the
years as a rule. The little physical change that does occur is for the
worse---gradual dilapidation, a few random, shabby new uses here and
there. People look at these few, random differences and regard them as
evidence, and perhaps as cause, of drastic change. Fight blight! They
regret that the neighborhood has changed. Yet the fact is, physically it
has changed remarkably little. People's feelings about it, rather, have
changed. The neighborhood shows a strange inability to update itself,
enliven itself, repair itself, or to be sought after, out of choice, by
a new generation. It is dead. Actually it was dead from birth, but
nobody noticed this much until the corpse began to smell.

Finally comes the decision, after exhortations to fix up and fight
blight have failed, that the whole thing must be wiped out and a new
cycle started. Perhaps some of the old buildings will
[]{#calibre_link-1270 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="199"}be left if
they can be "renewed" into the economic equivalent of new buildings. A
new corpse is laid out. It does not smell yet, but it is just as dead,
just as incapable of the constant adjustments, adaptations and
permutations that make up the processes of life.

There is no reason why this dismal, foredoomed cycle need be repeated.
If such an area is examined to see which of the other three conditions
for generating diversity are missing, and then those missing conditions
are corrected as well as they can be, some of the old buildings must go:
extra streets must be added, the concentration of people must be
heightened, room for new primary uses must be found, public and private.
But a good mingling of the old buildings must remain, and in remaining
they will have become something more than mere decay from the past or
evidence of previous failure. They will have become the shelter which is
necessary, and valuable to the district, for many varieties of
middling-, low- and no-yield diversity. The economic value of new
buildings is replaceable in cities. It is replaceable by the spending of
more construction money. But the economic value of old buildings is
irreplaceable at will. It is created by time. This economic requisite
for diversity is a requisite that vital city neighborhoods can only
inherit, and then sustain over the years.

Manhattan, for example, instead of on much cheaper ground near the edge,

that taxi fares alone for employees' business trips from the
inconvenient site would come to more, per year, than the difference in
land carrying costs! Stephen G. Thompson of *Architectural Forum* has
made the (unpublished) observation that redevelopment subsidies
frequently bring the cost of city land lower than the cost of carpet for
the buildings. To justify land costs higher than carpet costs, a city
has to be a *city*, not a machine or a desert.

:::

> [CONDITION]{.x-small} 4: *The district must have a sufficiently dense
> concentration of people, for whatever purpose they may be there*.
> *This includes people there because of residence.*

For centuries, probably everyone who has thought about cities at all has
noticed that there seems to be some connection between the concentration
of people and the specialties they can support. Samuel Johnson, for one,
remarked on this relationship back in 1785. "Men, thinly scattered," he
said to Boswell, "make a shift, but a bad shift, without many
things...It is being concentrated which produces convenience."

Observers are forever rediscovering this relationship in new times and
places. Thus in 1959, John H. Denton, a professor of business at the
University of Arizona, after studying American suburbs and British "new
towns" came to the conclusion that such places must rely on ready access
to a city for protection of []{#calibre_link-1281 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="201"}their cultural opportunities. "He based his
findings," reported the *New York Times*, "on the lack of a sufficient
density of population to support cultural facilities. Mr. Denton...said
that decentralization produced such a thin population spread that the
only effective economic demand that could exist in suburbs was that of
the majority. The only goods and cultural activities available will be
those that the majority requires, he observed," and so on.

Both Johnson and Professor Denton were speaking about the economic
effects of large numbers of people, but not numbers loosely added up
indefinitely from thinly spread populations. They were making the point
that it seems to matter greatly how thinly or how thickly people are
concentrated. They were comparing the effects of what we call high and
low densities.

This relationship of concentration---or high density---to conveniences
and to other kinds of diversity is generally well understood as it
applies to downtowns. Everyone is aware that tremendous numbers of
people concentrate in city downtowns and that, if they did not, there
would be no downtown to amount to anything---certainly not one with much
downtown diversity.

But this relationship between concentration and diversity is very little
considered when it comes to city districts where residence is a chief
use. Yet dwellings form a large part of most city districts. The people
who live in a district also form a large share, usually, of the people
who use the streets, the parks and the enterprises of the place. Without
help from the concentration of the people who live there, there can be
little convenience or diversity where people live, and where they
require it.

To be sure, the dwellings of a district (like any other use of the land)
need to be supplemented by other primary uses so people on the streets
will be well spread through the hours of the day, for the economic
reasons explained in [Chapter Eight](#calibre_link-18){.calibre7}. These
other uses (work, entertainment, or whatever) must make intensive use of
city land if they are to contribute effectively to concentration. If
they simply take up physical room and involve few people, they will do
little or nothing for diversity or liveliness. I think it is hardly
necessary to belabor that point.

This same point is just as important, however, about dwellings.
[]{#calibre_link-1287 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="202"}City
dwellings have to be intensive in their use of the land too, for reasons
that go much deeper than cost of land. On the other hand, this does not
mean that everyone can or should be put into elevator apartment houses
to live---or into any other one or two types of dwellings. That kind of
solution kills diversity by obstructing it from another direction.

Dwelling densities are so important for most city districts, and for
their future development, and are so little considered as factors in
vitality, that I shall devote this chapter to that aspect of city
concentration.

High dwelling densities have a bad name in orthodox planning and housing
theory. They are supposed to lead to every kind of difficulty and
failure.

But in our cities, at least, this supposed correlation between high
densities and trouble, or high densities and slums, is simply incorrect,
as anyone who troubles to look at real cities can see. Here are a few
illustrations:

In San Francisco, the district of highest dwelling densities---and
highest coverage of residential land with buildings too---is North
Beach-Telegraph Hill. This is a popular district that has spontaneously
and steadily unslummed itself in the years following the Depression and
the Second World War. San Francisco's chief slum problem, on the other
hand, is a district called the Western Addition, a place that has
steadily declined and is now being extensively cleared. The Western
Addition (which at one time, when it was new, was a good address) has a
dwelling-unit density considerably lower than North Beach-Telegraph
Hill's, and, for that matter, lower than the still fashionable Russian
Hill's and Nob Hill's.

In Philadelphia, Rittenhouse Square is the only district that has been
spontaneously upgrading and extending its edges, and is the only inner
city area that has not been designated for either renewal or clearance.
It has the highest dwelling density in Philadelphia. The North
Philadelphia slums currently display some of the city's most severe
social problems. They have dwelling densities averaging at most half
those of Rittenhouse Square. Vast territories of additional decay and
social disorder in Philadelphia have dwelling densities less than half
those of Rittenhouse Square.

[]{#calibre_link-1294 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="203"}In
Brooklyn, New York, the most generally admired, popular and upgrading
neighborhood is Brooklyn Heights; it has much the highest density of
dwellings in Brooklyn. Tremendous expanses of failed or decaying
Brooklyn gray area have densities half those of Brooklyn Heights or
less.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-103){#calibre_link-108 .calibre7}

In Manhattan, the most fashionable pocket of the midtown East Side, and
the most fashionable pocket of Greenwich Village have dwelling densities
in the same high range as the heart of Brooklyn Heights. But an
interesting difference can be observed. In Manhattan, very popular
areas, characterized by high degrees of vitality and diversity, surround
these most fashionable pockets. In these surrounding popular areas,
dwelling densities go still higher. In Brooklyn Heights, on the other
hand, the fashionable pocket is surrounded by neighborhoods where
dwelling unit densities drop off; vitality and popularity drop off too.

In Boston, as already mentioned in the introduction to this book, the
North End has unslummed itself and is one of the city's healthiest
areas. It has much the highest dwelling densities in
Boston.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-104){#calibre_link-109 .calibre7} The
Roxbury district, which has been steadily declining for a generation,
has a dwelling density about a ninth that of the North End's.

[]{#calibre_link-1298 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="204"}The
overcrowded slums of planning literature are teeming areas with a high
density of dwellings. The overcrowded slums of American real life are,
more and more typically, dull areas with a low density of dwellings. In
Oakland, California, the worst and most extensive slum problem is an
area of some two hundred blocks of detached, one- and two-family houses
which can hardly be called dense enough to qualify as real city
densities at all. Cleveland's worst slum problem is a square mile of
much the same thing. Detroit is largely composed, today, of seemingly
endless square miles of low-density failure. The East Bronx of New York,
which might almost stand as a symbol of the gray belts that have become
the despair of cities, has low densities for New York; in most parts of
the East Bronx, densities are well below the whole city averages. (New
York's average dwelling density is 55 units per net residential acre.)

However, it will not do to jump to the conclusion that all areas of high
dwelling density in cities do well. They do not, and to assume that this
is "the" answer would be to oversimplify outrageously. For instance,
Chelsea, much of the badly failed uptown West Side, and much of Harlem,
all in Manhattan, have dwelling densities in the same high ranges as
those of Greenwich Village, Yorkville and the midtown East Side.
Once-ultrafashionable Riverside Drive, plagued by trouble today, has
still higher dwelling
densities.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-105){#calibre_link-110 .calibre7}

[]{#calibre_link-1301 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="205"}We cannot
understand the effects of high and low densities if we assume that the
relationship between concentrations of people and production of
diversity is a simple, straight mathematical affair. The results of this
relationship (which Dr. Johnson and Professor Denton both spoke of in
its simple, crude form), are drastically influenced by other factors
too; three of these occupy the three preceding chapters.

No concentration of residents, however high it may be, is "sufficient"
if diversity is suppressed or thwarted by other insufficiencies. As an
extreme example, no concentration of residence, however high, is
"sufficient" to generate diversity in regimented projects, because
diversity has been regimented out in any case. And much the same
effects, for different reasons, can occur in unplanned city
neighborhoods, where the buildings are too standardized or the blocks
are too long, or there is no mixture of other primary uses besides
dwellings.

However, it still remains that dense concentrations of people are *one*
of the necessary conditions for flourishing city diversity. And it still
follows that in districts where people live, this means there must be a
dense concentration of their dwellings on the land preempted for
dwellings. The other factors that influence how much diversity is
generated, and where, will have nothing much to influence if enough
people are not there.

::: {#calibre_link-1304 .section_break}
---
:::

One reason why low city densities conventionally have a good name,
unjustified by the facts, and why high city densities have a bad name,
equally unjustified, is that high densities of dwellings and
overcrowding of dwellings are often confused. High densities mean large
numbers of dwellings per acre of land. Overcrowding means too many
people in a dwelling for the number of rooms it contains. The census
definition of overcrowding is 1.5 persons per room or more. It has
nothing to do with the number of dwellings on the land, just as in real
life high densities have nothing to do with overcrowding.

This confusion between high densities and overcrowding, which I will go
into briefly because it so much interferes with understanding the role
of densities, is another of the obfuscations we have inherited from
Garden City planning. The Garden City []{#calibre_link-1307 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="206"}planners and their disciples looked at
slums which had both many dwelling units on the land (high densities)
and too many people within individual dwellings (overcrowding), and
failed to make any distinction between the fact of overcrowded rooms and
the entirely different fact of densely built up land. They hated both
equally, in any case, and coupled them like ham and eggs, so that to
this day housers and planners pop out the phrase as if it were one word,
"highd­ensit­yando­vercr­owding."

Adding further to the confusion came a statistical monstrosity much used
by reformers to aid their housing-project crusades---a raw figure of
numbers of persons per acre. These menacing figures never tell how many
dwellings or how many rooms there are to the acre, and if the figure is
given for a badly troubled area---as it almost invariably is---the
implication is deafening that there is something dreadful, on the face
of it, in such heavy concentrations of people. The fact that the people
may be living four to a room, or may be a distillation of misery in
every guise, becomes all but irrelevant. It happens that Boston's North
End, with 963 persons per net residential acre, has a death rate (1956
figures) of 8.8 per thousand population and a TB death rate of 0.6 per
ten thousand. Boston's South End, meantime, has 361 persons per
residential acre, a death rate of 21.6 per thousand population, and a TB
death rate of 12 per ten thousand. It would be ridiculous to say that
these indications of something very wrong in the South End come of
having 361 persons per residential acre instead of almost 1,000. The
facts are more complicated. But it is equally ridiculous to take the
case of a miserable population at 1,000 persons to the acre and imply
that that figure is therefore villainous.

It is typical of this confusion between high densities and overcrowding
that one of the great Garden City planners, Sir Raymond Unwin, titled a
tract which had nothing to do with overcrowding, but instead with
super-block arrangements of low-density dwellings, *Nothing Gained by
Overcrowding*. By the 1930's, overcrowding of dwellings with people and
supposed "overcrowding" of land with buildings (i.e., city dwelling
densities and land coverage) were taken to be practically identical in
[]{#calibre_link-1310 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="207"}meaning and
results, insofar as the distinction was thought about at all. When
observers like Lewis Mumford and Catherine Bauer could not avoid
noticing that some very successful areas of cities had high densities of
dwellings and high ground coverages, but not too many persons in a
dwelling or a room, they took the tack (Mumford still takes it) that the
fortunate people living in comfort in these popular places are living in
slums, but are too insensitive to know it or resent it.

Overcrowding of dwellings and high densities of dwellings are always
being found one without the other. The North End and Greenwich Village
and Rittenhouse Square and Brooklyn Heights have high densities for
their cities, but with few exceptions their dwellings are not
overcrowded. The South End and North Philadelphia and Bedford-Stuyvesant
have much lower densities, but their dwellings frequently are
overcrowded, with too many persons in a dwelling. Today we are much more
apt to find overcrowding at low densities than at high densities.

Nor does slum clearance as practiced in our cities usually have anything
to do with solving the problem of overcrowding. Instead, slum clearance
and renewal typically add to that problem. When old buildings are
replaced with new projects, the dwelling densities are often made lower
than they were, so there are fewer dwellings in a district than before.
Even if the same dwelling densities are repeated, or lifted a little,
fewer people are accommodated than were put out, because the people who
were displaced were often overcrowded. The result is that overcrowding
increases somewhere else, especially if colored people, who can find few
areas in which to live, have been displaced. All cities carry laws
against overcrowding on their books, but these laws cannot be enforced
when the city's own rebuilding plans force overcrowding in new places.

In theory, one might suppose that the dense concentrations of people
necessary to help generate diversity in a city neighborhood can live in
either a sufficiently high density of dwellings or in an overcrowded
lower density of dwellings. The number of people in a given area could
be the same under these two conditions. But in real life the results are
different. In the case of []{#calibre_link-1314 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="208"}enough people in enough dwellings, the
diversity can be generated and people can develop attachment and loyalty
to their unique neighborhood mixture of things, without a built-in
destructive force---overcrowding of dwellings with too many people per
room---necessarily working at cross-purposes. Diversity and its
attractions are combined with tolerable living conditions in the case of
enough dwellings for enough people, and so more people who develop
choice are apt to stay put.

Overcrowding within dwellings or rooms, in our country, is almost always
a symptom of poverty or of being discriminated against, and it is one
(but only one) of many infuriating and discouraging liabilities of being
very poor or of being victimized by residential discrimination, or both.
Indeed, overcrowding at low densities may be even more depressing and
destructive than overcrowding at high densities, because at low
densities there is less public life as a diversion and escape, and as a
means, too, for fighting back politically at injustices and neglect.

Everybody hates overcrowding and those who must endure it hate it worst.
Almost nobody overcrowds by choice. But people often do live in
high-density neighborhoods by choice. Overcrowded neighborhoods,
low-density or high-density, are usually neighborhoods that did not work
out when they were inhabited in uncrowded fashion by people who had
choice. The people with choice left. Neighborhoods that have uncrowded
themselves with time, or have maintained uncrowding over several
generations, are apt to be neighborhoods that have been working out and
that both hold and attract the loyalty of people who do have choice. The
tremendous gray belts of relatively low density that ring our cities,
decaying and being deserted, or decaying and being overcrowded, are
significant signals of the typical failure of *low* densities in big
cities.

What are proper densities for city dwellings?

The answer to this is something like the answer Lincoln gave to the
question, "How long should a man's legs be?" Long enough to reach the
ground, Lincoln said.

Just so, proper city dwelling densities are a matter of performance.
They cannot be based on abstractions about the quantities
[]{#calibre_link-1321 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="209"}of land
that ideally should be allotted for so-and-so many people (living in
some docile, imaginary society).

Densities are too low, or too high, when they frustrate city diversity
instead of abetting it. This flaw in performance is *why* they are too
low or too high. We ought to look at densities in much the same way as
we look at calories and vitamins. Right amounts are right amounts
because of how they perform. And what is right differs in specific
instances.

Let us begin at the low end of the density scale to understand, broadly,
why a density that may perform well in one place is poor in another.

Very low densities, six dwellings or fewer to the net acre, can make out
well in suburbs. Lots at such densities average, say, 70 by 100 feet or
more. Some suburban densities go higher, of course; lots at ten
dwellings to the acre average just under, say, 50 by 90 feet, which is a
squeeze for suburban living but, with clever site planning, good design
and genuine suburban location, can yield a suburb or a reasonable
facsimile.

Between ten and twenty dwellings to the acre yields a kind of
semisuburb,[\*^4^](#calibre_link-106){#calibre_link-111 .calibre7}
consisting either of detached or two-family houses on handkerchief
plots, or else of generously sized row houses with relatively generous
yards or greens. These arrangements, although they are apt to be dull,
can be viable and safe if they are secluded from city life; for example
if they lie toward the outer edges of a big city. They will not generate
city liveliness or public life---their populations are too thin---nor
will they help maintain city sidewalk safety. But there may be no need
for them to do so.

However, densities of this kind ringing a city are a bad long-term bet,
destined to become gray area. As the city continues to grow, the
character that makes these semisuburbs reasonably attractive and
functional is lost. As they are engulfed and embedded deep in a city,
they lose, of course, their former geographical closeness to true
suburbs or countryside. But more than that, they lose their protection
from people who do not "fit in" to each other's private lives
economically or socially, and they lose their []{#calibre_link-1327
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="210"}aloofness from the peculiar
problems of city life. Swallowed into a city and its ordinary problems,
they possess no city vitality to contend with these problems.

In short, there is a justification for densities averaging twenty
dwellings or less to the acre, and there may be good reasons for these
densities, so long as their dwellings and neighborhoods are not everyday
part and parcel of a big city.

Above these semisuburban densities, the realities of city life can
seldom be evaded, even for a short time.

In cities (which you will recall have not the local self-containment of
towns), densities at twenty dwellings to the acre and above mean that
many people who live near each other geographically are strangers to one
another and always will be strangers. Not only that, but strangers from
elsewhere find it easy to be present because other neighborhoods of this
same density or higher are close by.

Rather abruptly, once a semisuburban density is exceeded, or a suburban
location engulfed, an entirely different kind of city settlement
exists---a settlement which now has different kinds of everyday jobs to
handle and a need for different ways of handling them, a settlement
which lacks assets of one kind but potentially has assets of another
kind. From this point on, a city settlement needs city vitality and city
diversity.

Unfortunately, however, densities high enough to bring with them innate
city problems are not by any means necessarily high enough to do their
share in producing city liveliness, safety, convenience and interest.
And so, between the point where semisuburban character and function are
lost, and the point at which lively diversity and public life can arise,
lies a range of big-city densities that I shall call "in-between"
densities. They are fit neither for suburban life nor for city life.
They are fit, generally, for nothing but trouble.

The "in-between" densities extend upward to the point, by definition, at
which genuine city life can start flourishing and its constructive
forces go to work. This point varies. It varies in different cities, and
it varies within the same city depending on how much help the dwellings
are getting from other primary []{#calibre_link-1334 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="211"}uses, and from users attracted to
liveliness or uniqueness from outside the
district.[\*^5^](#calibre_link-107){#calibre_link-112 .calibre7}

Districts like Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia and North
Beach-Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, both of which enjoy great good
fortune in mixtures of uses and attractions to outside users, can
demonstrably maintain vitality at densities of approximately 100
dwelling units to the net acre. On the other hand, in Brooklyn Heights
this is evidently not enough. Where the average there falls off to 100
dwellings to the net acre, vitality falls off.

I can find only one city district with vitality that has well under 100
dwellings per acre, and this is the Back-of-the-Yards in Chicago. It is
able to be an exception because politically this district gets the
benefits that ordinarily come only with dense concentration. At
"in-between" densities it nevertheless has enough people to swing weight
in a big city because its functioning district territory extends much
farther geographically than other districts manage except in name, and
it uses this full political weight with extraordinary skill and steel to
get what it needs. But even the Back-of-the-Yards shares some of the
liabilities of visual monotony, small, everyday inconvenience, and fear
of strangers who look too alien, that go virtually always with
"in-between" densities. The Back-of-the-Yards is gradually raising its
densities, to take care of the district population's natural increase.
To increase []{#calibre_link-1337 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="212"}densities gradually, as is being done here, is by no means
undercutting this district's social and economic assets. On the
contrary, it is strengthening them.

To fix upon a functional answer as to where the "in-between" densities
end, we can say that a district escapes from them when its land devoted
to dwellings is dense enough to do a good primary-diversity job of
helping to generate flourishing secondary city diversity and liveliness.
A density figure that accomplishes this in one place may be much too low
in another.

A numerical answer means less than a functional answer (and
unfortunately can even deafen the dogmatic to the truer and more subtle
reports that come in from life). But I should judge that numerically the
escape from "in-between" densities probably lies somewhere around the
figure of 100 dwellings to an acre, under circumstances *most congenial
in all other respects* to producing diversity. As a general rule, I
think 100 dwellings per acre will be found to be too low.

Assuming that an escape has been made from the trouble-creating
"in-between" densities, let us return to consideration of viable city
densities. How high "should" city dwelling densities go? How high can
they go?

Obviously, if the object is vital city life, the dwelling densities
should go as high as they need to go to stimulate the maximum potential
diversity in a district. Why waste a city district's and a city
population's potential for creating interesting and vigorous city life?

It follows, however, that densities can get too high if they reach a
point at which, for any reason, they begin to repress diversity instead
of to stimulate it. Precisely this can happen, and it is the main point
in considering how high is too high.

The reason dwelling densities can begin repressing diversity if they get
too high is this: At some point, to accommodate so many dwellings on the
land, standardization of the buildings must set in. This is fatal,
because great diversity in age and types of buildings has a direct,
explicit connection with diversity of population, diversity of
enterprises and diversity of scenes.

Among all the various kinds of buildings (old or new) in a city,
[]{#calibre_link-1346 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="213"}some kinds
are always less efficient than others in adding dwellings to the land. A
three-story building will get fewer dwellings onto a given number of
square feet of land than a five-story building; a five-story building,
fewer than a ten-story building. If you want to go up far enough, the
number of dwellings that can go onto a given plot of land is
stupendous---as Le Corbusier demonstrated with his schemes for a city of
repetitive skyscrapers in a park.

But in this process of packing dwellings on given acreages of land, it
does not do to get too efficient, and it never did. There must be leeway
for variety among buildings. All those variations that are of less than
maximum efficiency get crowded out. Maximum efficiency, or anything
approaching it, means standardization.

At any particular place and time, under the given circumstances of
regulations, technology and financing, some particular way of packing
dwellings onto the land is apt to be the most efficient way. At some
places and times, for example, narrow three-story row houses were
apparently the answer for maximum efficiency at getting city dwellings
on the land. Where these crowded out all other dwelling types they
brought a pall of monotony. At another period, wider five- or six-story
walk-up tenements were the most efficient. When Riverside Drive in
Manhattan was built up, twelve- and fourteen-story elevator apartments
were apparently the answer for maximum packing efficiency, and with this
particular standardization as a base, the highest dwelling density belt
in Manhattan has been produced.

Elevator apartments are today the most efficient way of packing
dwellings on a given amount of building land. And within this type are
certain most efficient subtypes such as those of maximum height for
low-speed elevators, usually considered today as twelve stories, and
those of maximum economic height for pouring reinforced concrete. (Such
height in turn depends on the technological improvement of cranes, so
this figure increases every few years. As this is written, it is
twenty-two stories.) Elevator apartments are not only the most efficient
way of packing people on a given amount of land. They can, under
unfavorable circumstances, also be probably the most dangerous way of
doing it, as []{#calibre_link-1350 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="214"}experience in many a low-income housing project shows. In
some circumstances, they are excellent.

Elevator apartments do not produce standardization by virtue of being
elevator apartments, any more than three-story houses produce
standardization by virtue of being three-story houses. But elevator
apartments do produce standardization when they are almost the only way
a neighborhood is housed---just as three-story houses produce
*monotonous* standardization when they are almost the only way in which
a neighborhood is housed.

No one way is a good way to house a city neighborhood; no mere two or
three ways are good. The more variations there can be, the better. As
soon as the range and number of variations in buildings decline, the
diversity of population and enterprises is too apt to stay static or
decline, instead of increasing.

It is not easy to reconcile high densities with great variety in
buildings, yet it must be attempted. Anti-city planning and zoning
virtually prevent it, as we shall see.

Popular high-density city areas have considerable variation among their
buildings---sometimes immense variation. Greenwich Village is such a
place. It manages to house people at densities ranging from 125 to above
200 dwelling units per acre, without standardization of buildings. These
averages are obtained from mixtures of everything from single-family
houses, houses with flats, tenements and all kinds of small apartment
houses and flats, on up to elevator apartments of many different ages
and sizes.

The reason Greenwich Village can reconcile such high densities with such
great variety is that a high proportion of the land which is devoted to
residences (called net residential acres) is covered with buildings.
Relatively little is left open and unbuilt upon. In most parts, the
buildings cover the residential land at averages estimated as ranging
from 60 percent to 80 percent of the land, leaving the other 40 percent
to 20 percent of the land unbuilt on as yards, courts and the like. This
is a high ratio of ground coverage. It is so efficient a use of the
*land* itself, that it permits a good deal of "inefficiency" in
buildings. Most of them need not be highly efficient at packing, but
even so, high average densities are reached.

Now, suppose that only 15 percent to 25 percent of the residential
[]{#calibre_link-1357 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="215"}land is
built upon, and the other 75 percent to 85 percent is left open and
unbuilt on. These are common figures for housing projects, with their
expanses of open land which are so hard to control in city life and
produce so much vacuity and trouble. More open land means remarkably
less building space. If open land is doubled from 40 percent and becomes
80 percent, the amount of land that can be built upon is cut by two
thirds! Instead of having 60 percent of the land to build on, you have
only 20 percent to build on.

When so much land is left open, the land itself is being used
"inefficiently" so far as packing dwellings on it is concerned. The
strait jacket is very tight when only 20 percent or 25 percent can be
built upon. The density of dwellings must be very low, or,
alternatively, dwellings must be packed with great efficiency onto the
fraction of the ground that can take the buildings. Under these
circumstances, it is impossible to reconcile high densities with
variety. Elevator apartments, and often very high ones, are unavoidable.

The Stuyvesant Town project in Manhattan has a density of 125 dwellings
per net acre, a density that would be on the low side for Greenwich
Village. Yet to accommodate so many dwellings as this in Stuyvesant
Town, where the ground coverage is only 25 percent (75 percent left
open), the dwellings must be most rigidly standardized in rank upon rank
of virtually identical, massive elevator apartment houses. More
imaginative architects and site planners might have arranged the
buildings differently, but no possible difference could be more than
superficial. Mathematical impossibility would defy genius itself to
introduce genuine substantial variety at these low ground coverages with
these densities.

Henry Whitney, an architect and project housing expert, has worked out
many theoretically possible combinations of elevator buildings with
lower buildings, using the low ground coverages required for public
housing and for nearly all federally subsidized renewal. Mr. Whitney
found that no matter how you slice it, it is physically impossible to
get above low city densities (40 to an acre or thereabouts) without
standardizing all but a minute token of the dwellings*---unless ground
coverages are increased,* which []{#calibre_link-1361 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="216"}is to say unless open space is decreased.
One hundred dwellings to the acre at low ground coverages yield not even
token variety---and yet this density is a probable minimum if the unfit
"in-between" densities are to be avoided.

Low ground coverages---no matter by what means they are imposed, from
local zoning to federal fiat---and diversity of buildings, and viable
city densities are thus conditions that are incompatible with one
another. At low coverages, if the densities are high enough to help
engender city diversity, they are automatically too high to *permit*
diversity. The thing is a built-in contradiction.

Assuming that ground coverages are high, however, just how high can a
neighborhood's densities go without sacrificing the neighborhood to
standardization? This depends a good deal on how many variations, and
what variations, already exist in a neighborhood from the past.
Variations from the past are a foundation to which new variations of the
present (and eventually the future) are added. A neighborhood already
standardized, from the past, at three-story houses or five-story
tenements is not going to get a full, good range of variation by adding
one more type in the present, thereby creating a higher density and
letting it go at that. The worst case possible is no foundation from the
past at all: empty land.

It is hardly possible to expect that many really different types of
dwellings or their buildings can be added *at any one time*. To think
they can be is wishful thinking. There are fashions in building. Behind
the fashions lie economic and technological reasons, and these fashions
exclude all but a few genuinely different possibilities in city dwelling
construction *at any one time*.

In districts where densities are too low, they can be raised and
variation increased by adding new buildings simultaneously in different,
separated spots only. In short, densities should be raised---and new
buildings introduced for this purpose---gradually rather than in some
sudden, cataclysmic upheaval to be followed by nothing more for decades.
The very process of increasing densities gradually but continually can
result in increasing variety too, and thus can permit high ultimate
densities without standardization.

[]{#calibre_link-1367 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="217"}How high
ultimate densities can go without standardization is limited finally, of
course, by the land, even when the coverage of the ground is very high.
In the North End of Boston, the high densities, averaging 275 dwellings
per acre, include considerable variation; but this good combination has
been partly obtained at the expense of ground coverages which reach too
high a proportion of the land behind some buildings. Too much building
has occurred, in the past, as a second layer in the back yards and
courts within the little blocks. Actually, these interior buildings add
a relatively small share to the density, for they are small and usually
low. And they are not a fault in every case either; as occasional
oddities they are charming. The trouble comes from too many. With the
addition to the district of a few elevator apartments houses---a variety
of accommodation the North End lacks---open spaces inside blocks could
be somewhat increased without lowering district densities. At the same
time the district's variety of accommodations would be increased, rather
than lessened. But this could not be done if pseudo-city low ground
coverages had to accompany the elevator buildings.

I doubt that it is possible, without drastic standardization, to go
higher than the North End's density of 275 dwellings per net acre. For
most districts---lacking the North End's peculiar and long heritage of
different building types---the ultimate danger mark imposing
standardization must be considerably lower; I should guess, roughly,
that it is apt to hover at about 200 dwellings to the net acre.

::: {#calibre_link-1369 .section_break}

:::

Now we must bring the streets into this.

High ground coverages, necessary as they are for variety at high
densities, can become intolerable, particularly as they approach 70
percent. They become intolerable if the land is not interlaced with
frequent streets. Long blocks with high ground coverages are oppressive.
Frequent streets, because they are openings between buildings,
compensate for high coverage of ground off the streets.

Frequent streets are necessary to city districts in any case, if
diversity is to be generated. So their importance as an accompaniment to
high ground coverage merely reinforces the need.

[]{#calibre_link-1374 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="218"}However, it
is obvious that if streets are numerous, instead of scarce, open land in
the form of streets has been added. If we add public parks in lively
places, we are also adding another kind of open land. And if
nonresidential buildings are well mingled into dwelling areas (as they
must be if primary uses are well mixed), a similar effect is achieved,
in that dwellings and residents of the district as a sum total are
thinned to that extent.

The combination of these devices---more numerous streets, lively parks
in lively places, and various nonresidential uses mingled in, together
with great variations among the dwellings themselves---creates totally
different effects from grimly unrelieved high densities and high ground
coverages. But this combination also creates a number of effects totally
different from high densities "relieved" by quantities of open
residential grounds. The results are so different because each of these
other devices I have mentioned provides far more than "relief" from high
ground coverages. Each contributes, in its own distinctive and
indispensable way, to the diversity and vitality of an area, so that
something constructive, instead of merely inert, can result from the
high densities.

::: {#calibre_link-1376 .section_break}

:::

To say that cities need high dwelling densities and high net ground
coverages, as I am saying they do, is conventionally regarded as lower
than taking sides with the man-eating shark.

But things have changed since the days when Ebenezer Howard looked at
the slums of London and concluded that to save the people, city life
must be abandoned. Advances in fields less moribund than city planning
and housing reform, fields such as medicine, sanitation and
epidemiology, nutrition and labor legislation, have profoundly
revolutionized dangerous and degrading conditions that were once
inseparable from high-density city life.

Meantime, populations in metropolitan areas (central cities, together
with their suburbs and dependent towns) have continued to grow, to the
point where they now absorb 97 percent of our total population
increases.

"The trend may be expected to continue," says Dr. Philip M. Hauser,
director of the University of Chicago's population research center,
"...because such agglomerations of population []{#calibre_link-1381
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="219"}represent the most efficient
producer and consumer units that our society has yet devised. The very
size, density and congestion of our Standard Metropolitan Areas, to
which some city planners object, are among our most precious economic
assets."

Between 1958 and 1980, Dr. Hauser points out, the U.S. population is
going to increase by an amount somewhere between 57 million (assuming a
decline to the low 1942-44 birth rate) and 99 million (assuming an
increase in birth rate 10 percent above the 1958 level). If the birth
rate continues at the 1958 level, the increase will be 86 million.

Virtually all this growth will go into metropolitan areas. Much of the
increase, of course, will come directly from big cities themselves,
because big cities are no longer eaters of people as they were not so
long ago. They have become suppliers of people.

The increase can be dribbled out in suburbs, semisuburbs and dull new
"in-between" belts---spreading from dull, inner cities of predominately
low-vitality, "in-between" densities.

Or we can take advantage of this metropolitan area growth and, with at
least part of it, we can begin building up currently unfit city
districts, limping along at "in-between" densities---build them up to
the point where (in conjunction with other conditions for generating
diversity) these concentrations of population can support city life
possessing character and liveliness.

Our difficulty is no longer how to contain people densely in
metropolitan areas and avoid the ravages of disease, bad sanitation and
child labor. To go on thinking in these terms is anachronistic. Our
difficulty today is rather how to contain people in metropolitan areas
and avoid the ravages of apathetic and helpless neighborhoods.

The solution cannot lie in vain attempts to plan new, self-sufficient
towns or little cities throughout metropolitan regions. Our metropolitan
areas are already dotted with amorphous, disintegrated places that
*once* were relatively self-sufficient and integrated towns or little
cities. The day they are pulled into the intricate economy of a
metropolitan area, with its multiplicity of choices in places of work,
recreation and shopping, they begin to lose their integrity, their
relative completeness, socially, economically and culturally. We cannot
have it both ways: our twentieth-century []{#calibre_link-1388 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="220"}metropolitan economy combined with
nineteenth-century, isolated town or little-city life.

Because we are faced with the fact of big-city and metropolitan
populations, big ones that will get bigger, we are faced with the job of
intelligently developing genuine city life and increasing city economic
strength. It is silly to try to deny the fact that we Americans are a
city people, living in a city economy---and in the process of denying
this lose all the true countryside of metropolitan areas too, as we have
been steadily losing it at about 3,000 acres a day for the past ten
years.

However, reason does not rule this world, and it will not necessarily
rule here. The unreasoning dogma that healthy areas like the
high-density North End of Boston *must* be slums, or *must* be bad,
because they are high-density, would not have been accepted by modern
planners as it has if there were not two fundamentally different ways of
looking at the question of people in dense concentrations---and if those
two ways were not, at bottom, emotional.

People gathered in concentrations of big-city size and density can be
felt to be an automatic---if necessary---evil. This is a common
assumption: that human beings are charming in small numbers and noxious
in large numbers. Given this point of view, it follows that
concentrations of people should be physically minimized in every way: by
thinning down the numbers themselves insofar as this is possible, and
beyond that by aiming at illusions of suburban lawns and small-town
placidity. It follows that the exuberant variety inherent in great
numbers of people, tightly concentrated, should be played down, hidden,
hammered into a semblance of the thinner, more tractable variety or the
outright homogeneity often represented in thinner populations. It
follows that these confusing creatures---so many people gathered
together---should be sorted out and stashed away as decently and quietly
as possible, like chickens on a modern egg-factory farm.

On the other hand, people gathered in concentrations of city size and
density can be considered a positive good, in the faith that they are
desirable because they are the source of immense vitality, and because
they do represent, in small geographic compass, a great and exuberant
richness of differences and possibilities, []{#calibre_link-1393
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="221"}many of these differences unique
and unpredictable and all the more valuable because they are. Given this
point of view, it follows that the presence of great numbers of people
gathered together in cities should not only be frankly accepted as a
physical fact. It follows that they should also be enjoyed as an asset
and their presence celebrated: by raising their concentrations where it
is needful for flourishing city life, and beyond that by aiming for a
visibly lively public street life and for accommodating and encouraging,
economically and visually, as much variety as possible.

Systems of thought, no matter how objective they may purport to be, have
underlying emotional bases and values. The development of modern city
planning and housing reform has been emotionally based on a glum
reluctance to accept city concentrations of people as desirable, and
this negative emotion about city concentrations of people has helped
deaden planning intellectually.

No good for cities or for their design, planning, economics or people,
can come of the emotional assumption that dense city populations are,
per se, undesirable. In my view, they are an asset. The task is to
promote the city life of city people, housed, let us hope, in
concentrations both dense enough *and* diverse enough to offer them a
decent chance at developing city life.

[\*^1^](#calibre_link-108){.calibre7} Here are the density figures for
these examples. They are given in numbers of dwelling units per net acre
of residential land. When two figures are given, they represent a range
into which the average or averages for the place concerned fall (which
is the way this data is often tabulated or mapped). In San Francisco:
North Beach-Telegraph Hill, 80-140, about the same as Russian Hill and
Nob Hill, but the buildings cover more of the residential ground in
North Beach-Telegraph Hill; the Western Addition, 55-60. In
Philadelphia: Rittenhouse Square, 80-100; North Philadelphia slums,
about 40; row-house neighborhoods in trouble, typically 30-45. In
Brooklyn: Brooklyn Heights, 125-174 at heart and 75-124 in most of the
remainder; drop-offs to 45-74 beyond; as examples of Brooklyn areas in
decline or trouble, Bedford-Stuyvesant, about half at 75-124 and half at
45-74; Red Hook, mostly 45-74; some Brooklyn spots in decay as low as
15-24. In Manhattan: most fashionable pocket of midtown East Side,
125-174, rising in Yorkville to 175-254; Greenwich Village, most
fashionable pocket, 124-174, rising to 175-254 for most of remainder
with pocket containing stable, old, unslummed Italian community rising
above 255. In Boston, North End, 275; Roxbury, 21-40.

[\*^2^](#calibre_link-109){.calibre7} For Boston and New York, these
figures are from planning commission measurements and tabulations; for
San Francisco and Philadelphia they are estimates by planning or
redevelopment staff members.

[\*^3^](#calibre_link-110){.calibre7} Although all cities make a fetish
of minute density analysis in project planning, surprisingly few have
much accurate data on nonproject densities. (One planning director told
me he could see no reason for studying them except as light on how big
the relocation problem would be if they were knocked down!) No city that
I know of has studied just what localized, building-by-building
variations in density go into the makeup of density averages in
successful and popular neighborhoods. "It's too hard to generalize about
districts like that," complained a planning director when I asked him
about specific density variations, at small scale, in one of his city's
most successful districts. It is hard, or impossible, to generalize
about such districts precisely because they are, themselves, so little
"generalized" or standardized in their groupings. This very
capriciousness and diversity of the components is one of the most
important, and most ignored, facts about density averages in successful
districts.

[\*^4^](#calibre_link-111){.calibre7} The classic ideal of strict Garden
City planning has been in this range: twelve dwellings to the acre.

[\*^5^](#calibre_link-112){.calibre7} Some planning theorists call for
urban variety and liveliness, and simultaneously prescribe "in-between"
densities. For example, in the Winter 1960-61 issue of *Landscape*
magazine, Lewis Mumford writes, "Now the great function of the city
is...to permit, indeed to encourage and incite, the greatest potential
number of meetings, encounters, challenges, between all persons, classes
and groups, providing, as it were, a stage upon which the drama of
social life may be enacted, with the actors taking their turn as
spectators and the spectators as actors." In the next paragraph,
however, he castigates city areas occupied at densities of 200 to 500
*persons* (italics mine) per acre, and recommends "housing that will
permit parks and gardens as an integral part of the design, at densities
not higher than a hundred, or at most, in quarters for childless people,
of 125 *persons* per acre." Densities of 100 *persons* per acre mean
dwelling-unit densities in the range of 25-50 per acre. Urbanity and
"in-between" densities like this can be combined only theoretically;
they are incompatible because of the economics of generating city
diversity.

# Some myths about diversity {#calibre_link-1401 .chaphead1}
:::

"Mixed uses look ugly. They cause traffic congestion. They invite
ruinous uses."

These are some of the bugbears that cause cities to combat diversity.
These beliefs help shape city zoning regulations. They have helped
rationalize city rebuilding into the sterile, regimented, empty thing it
is. They stand in the way of planning that could deliberately encourage
spontaneous diversity by providing the conditions necessary to its
growth.

Intricate minglings of different uses in cities are not a form of chaos.
On the contrary, they represent a complex and highly developed form of
order. Everything in this book so far has been directed toward showing
how this complex order of mingled uses works.

Nevertheless, even though intricate mixtures of buildings, uses and
scenes are necessary for successful city districts, does diversity
carry, too, the disadvantages of ugliness, warring uses and congestion
[]{#calibre_link-1406 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="223"}that are
conventionally attributed to it by planning lore and literature?

These supposed disadvantages are based on images of unsuccessful
districts which have not too much, but too little diversity. They call
up visions of dull, down-at-heel residential areas, pocked with a few
shabby, shoestring enterprises. They call up visions of low-value land
uses, like junk yards or used-car lots. They call up visions of garish,
sprawling, unremitting commerce. None of these conditions, however,
represents flourishing city diversity. On the contrary, these represent
precisely the senility that befalls city neighborhoods in which
exuberant diversity has either failed to grow or has died off with time.
They represent what happens to semisuburbs which are engulfed by their
cities but fail, themselves, to grow up and behave economically like
successful city districts.

Flourishing city diversity, of the kind that is catalyzed by the
combination of mixed primary uses, frequent streets, mixture of building
ages and overheads, and dense concentration of users, does not carry
with it the disadvantages of diversity conventionally assumed by
planning pseudoscience. I now intend to show why it does not carry them,
and why these disadvantages are fantasies which, like all fantasies that
are taken too seriously, interfere with handling reality.

::: {#calibre_link-1409 .section_break}
---
:::

Let us consider, first, the belief that diversity looks ugly. Anything
looks ugly, to be sure, if it is done badly. But this belief implies
something else. It implies that city diversity of uses is inherently
messy in appearance; and it also implies that places stamped with
homogeneity of uses look better, or at any rate are more amenable to
pleasant or orderly esthetic treatment.

But homogeneity or close similarity among uses, in real life, poses very
puzzling esthetic problems.

If the sameness of use is shown candidly for what it is---sameness---it
looks monotonous. Superficially, this monotony might be thought of as a
sort of order, however dull. But esthetically, it unfortunately also
carries with it a deep disorder: the disorder of conveying no direction.
In places stamped with the monotony and repetition of sameness you move,
but in moving you seem to []{#calibre_link-1413 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="224"}have gotten nowhere. North is the same as
south, or east as west. Sometimes north, south, east and west are all
alike, as they are when you stand within the grounds of a large project.
It takes differences---many differences---cropping up in different
directions to keep us oriented. Scenes of thoroughgoing sameness lack
these natural announcements of direction and movement, or are scantly
furnished with them, and so they are deeply confusing. This is a kind of
chaos.

Monotony of this sort is generally considered too oppressive to pursue
as an ideal by everybody but some project planners or the most
routine-minded real estate developers.

Instead, where uses are in actual fact homogeneous, we often find that
deliberate distinctions and differences are contrived among the
buildings. But these contrived differences give rise to esthetic
difficulties too. Because inherent differences---those that come from
genuinely differing uses---are lacking among the buildings and their
settings, the contrivances represent the desire merely to *appear*
different.

Some of the more blatant manifestations of this phenomenon were well
described, back in 1952, by Douglas Haskell, editor of *Architectural
Forum*, under the term "googie architecture." Googie architecture could
then be seen in its finest flowering among the essentially homogeneous
and standardized enterprises of roadside commercial strips: hot-dog
stands in the shape of hot dogs, ice-cream stands in the shape of
ice-cream cones. These are obvious examples of virtual sameness trying,
by dint of exhibitionism, to appear unique and different from their
similar commercial neighbors. Mr. Haskell pointed out that the same
impulses to look special (in spite of not *being* special) were at work
also in more sophisticated construction: weird roofs, weird stairs,
weird colors, weird signs, weird anything.

Recently Mr. Haskell has observed that similar signs of exhibitionism
have been appearing in supposedly dignified establishments.

Indeed they have: in office buildings, shopping centers, civic centers,
airline terminals. Eugene Raskin, professor of architecture at Columbia
University, commented on this same phenomenon in an essay, "On the
Nature of Variety," in the Summer 1960 []{#calibre_link-1419 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="225"}issue of the *Columbia University Forum*.
Genuine architectural variety, Raskin pointed out, does not consist in
using different colors or textures.

Can it be in using contrasting forms? \[he asked\]. A visit to one of
the larger shopping centers (the Cross County Shopping Center in New
York's Westchester County comes to mind, but pick your own) will make
the point: though slabs, towers, circles and flying stairs bound and
abound all over the lot, the result has the appalling sameness of the
tortures of hell. They may poke you with different instruments, but it's
all pain...

When we build, say, a business area in which all (or practically all)
are engaged in earning their livings, or a residential area in which
everyone is deep in the demands of domesticity, or a shopping area
dedicated to the exchange of cash and commodities---in short, where the
pattern of human activity contains only one element, it is impossible
for the architecture to achieve a convincing variety---convincing of the
known facts of human variation. The designer may vary color, texture and
form until his drawing instruments buckle under the strain, proving once
more that art is the one medium in which one cannot lie successfully.

The more homogeneity of use in a street or a neighborhood, the greater
is the temptation to be different in the only way left to be different.
Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles is an example of one grand exercise
after another in superficially contrived distinction, for several miles
of innately monotonous office buildings.

But Los Angeles is not unique in presenting us with such vistas. San
Francisco, for all its scorn of this kind of thing in Los Angeles, looks
much the same at its new outskirts of sorted-out shopping centers and
housing developments, and for the same basic reasons. Euclid Avenue in
Cleveland, which used to be considered by many critics one of the most
beautiful of American avenues (it was, in those days, essentially a
suburban avenue of large, fine houses with large, fine grounds), has now
been excoriated, with justice, by critic Richard A. Miller in
*Architectural Forum*, as one of the ugliest and most disorganized of
city streets. In converting to outright urban use, Euclid Avenue has
converted []{#calibre_link-1426 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="226"}to homogeneity: office buildings again, and again a chaos of
shouted, but superficial, differences.

Homogeneity of uses poses an unavoidable esthetic dilemma: Shall the
homogeneity look as homogeneous as it is, and be frankly monotonous? Or
shall it try not to look as homogeneous as it is and go in for
eye-catching, but meaningless and chaotic differences? This, in city
guise, is the old, familiar esthetic zoning problem of homogeneous
suburbs: Shall they zone to require conformity in appearance, or shall
they zone to prohibit sameness? If to prohibit sameness, where must the
line be drawn against what is too nonconforming in design?

Wherever a city area is functionally homogeneous in its uses, this also
becomes an esthetic dilemma for the city, and in more intensive form
than in the suburbs, because buildings are so much more dominant in the
general scene of cities. It is a ridiculous dilemma for cities, and it
has no decent answer.

Diversity of uses, on the other hand, while it is too often handled
poorly, does offer the decent possibility of displaying genuine
differences of content. Therefore these can become interesting and
stimulating differences to the eye, without phoniness, exhibitionism or
belabored novelty.

Fifth Avenue in New York between Fortieth Street and Fifty-ninth Street
is tremendously diverse in its large and small shops, bank buildings,
office buildings, churches, institutions. Its architecture expresses
these differences in use, and differences accrue from the varying ages
of the buildings, differences in technology and historical taste. But
Fifth Avenue does not look disorganized, fragmented or
exploded.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-113){#calibre_link-117 .calibre7} Fifth
Avenue's architectural contrasts and differences arise mainly out of
differences in content. They are sensible and natural contrasts and
differences. The whole hangs together remarkably well, without being
monotonous either.

[]{#calibre_link-1432 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="227"}The new
office stretch of New York's Park Avenue is far more standardized in
content than Fifth Avenue. Park Avenue has the advantage of containing
among its new office buildings several which, in themselves, are
masterpieces of modern
design.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-114){#calibre_link-118 .calibre7} But does
homogeneity of use or homogeneity of age help Park Avenue esthetically?
On the contrary, the office blocks of Park Avenue are wretchedly
disorganized in appearance, and far more given than Fifth Avenue to a
total effect of chaotic architectural willfulness, overlaid on boredom.

There are many instances of city diversity that include the use of
residences and come off well. The Rittenhouse Square area in
Philadelphia, Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, parts of the North End in
Boston, afford examples. Small groups of residential buildings can be
similar or even identical to each other without imposing a pall of
monotony, so long as the grouping takes in no more than a short street
block, and is not thereupon immediately repeated. In such a case, we
look at the grouping as a unit, and see it as differing, in content and
appearance, from whatever the next use or residential type may be.

Sometimes diversity of uses, combined with diversity of age, can even
take the curse of monotony off blocks that are far too long---and again
without the need for exhibitionism because differences of real substance
exist. An example of this kind of diversity is Eleventh Street between
Fifth and Sixth Avenues in New York, a street admired as both dignified
and interesting to walk on. Along its south side it contains, going
west, a fourteen-story apartment house, a church, seven three-story
houses, a five-story house, thirteen four-story houses, a nine-story
apartment, five four-story houses with a restaurant and bar at the
street level, a five-story apartment, a little graveyard, and a
six-story apartment house with a restaurant at street level; on the
north side, again going west, it contains a church, a four-story house
with a nursery school in it, a nine-story apartment house, three
five-story houses, a six-story apartment house, an eight-story apartment
house, five four-story houses, a six-story residence club, two
five-story apartment houses, another five-story apartment house of very
different vintage, a nine-story apartment house, a new
[]{#calibre_link-1435 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="228"}addition to
the New School for Social Research with a library at street level and a
public view to the interior courtyard, a four-story house, a five-story
apartment house with a restaurant at street level, a mean- and
cheap-looking one-story laundry and cleaner, a three-story apartment
house with a candy and newspaper store at street level. While these are
nearly all residential buildings, they are broken into by instances of
ten other uses. Even the purely residential buildings themselves embrace
many different periods of technology and taste, many different modes and
costs of living. They have an almost fantastic array of matter-of-fact,
modestly stated differences: different heights at first-floor levels,
differing arrangements for entrances and sidewalk access. These arise
directly out of the fact that the buildings actually are different in
kind and age. The effect is both serene and unself-conscious.

Still more interesting visual effects, and again without any need for
exhibitionism or other phoniness, can and do arise in cities from
mixtures in building types far more radical than those of Eleventh
Street---more radical because they are based on more radical inherent
differences. Most landmarks and focal points in cities---of which we
need more, not fewer---come from the contrast of a use radically
different from its surroundings, and therefore inherently
special-looking, happily located to make some drama and contrast of the
inherent difference. This, of course, was what Peets was talking about
(see [Chapter Eight](#calibre_link-18){.calibre7}) when he advocated
that monumental or noble buildings be set within the matrix of the city,
instead of being sorted out and withdrawn into "courts of honor" with
other inherently similar neighbors there.

Nor are the innate radical differences of humbler elements in city
mixtures to be scorned esthetically. They too can convey the pleasures
of contrast, movement and direction, without forced superficialities:
the workshops that turn up mingled with residences, the manufacturing
buildings, the art gallery next to the fish market that delights me
every time I go to buy fish, the hoity-toity gourmet shop in another
part of town that peacefully contrasts and coexists with a robust bar of
the kind where new Irish immigrants come to hear about jobs.

[]{#calibre_link-1439 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="229"}Genuine
differences in the city architectural scene express, as Raskin says so
excellently,

> ...the interweaving of *human* patterns. They are full of people doing

In seeking visual order, cities are able to choose among three broad
alternatives, two of which are hopeless and one of which is hopeful.
They can aim for areas of homogeneity which look homogeneous, and get
results depressing and disorienting. They can aim for areas of
homogeneity which try not to look homogeneous, and get results of
vulgarity and dishonesty. Or they can aim for areas of great diversity
and, because real differences are thereby expressed, can get results
which, at worst, are merely interesting, and at best can be delightful.

How to accommodate city diversity well in visual terms, how to respect
its freedom while showing visually that it is a form of order, is the
central esthetic problem of cities. I shall deal with it in [Chapter
Nineteen](#calibre_link-31){.calibre7} of this book. For the moment, the
point is this: City diversity is not innately ugly. That is a
misconception, and a most simple-minded one. But lack of city diversity
is innately either depressing on the one hand, or vulgarly chaotic on
the other.

Is it true that diversity causes traffic congestion?

Traffic congestion is caused by vehicles, not by people in themselves.

Wherever people are thinly settled, rather than densely concentrated, or
wherever diverse uses occur infrequently, any specific attraction does
cause traffic congestion. Such places as clinics, []{#calibre_link-1448
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="230"}shopping centers or movies bring
with them a concentration of traffic---and what is more, bring traffic
heavily along the routes to and from them. A person who needs or wants
to use them can do so only by car. Even a grade school can mean traffic
congestion in such a milieu, because children must be carried to school.
Lack of wide ranges of concentrated diversity can put people into
automobiles for almost all their needs. The spaces required for roads
and for parking spread everything out still farther, and lead to still
greater uses of vehicles.

This is tolerable where the population is thinly spread. It becomes an
intolerable condition, destructive of all other values and all other
aspects of convenience, where populations are heavy or continuous.

In dense, diversified city areas, people still walk, an activity that is
impractical in suburbs and in most gray areas. The more intensely
various and close-grained the diversity in an area, the more walking.
Even people who come into a lively, diverse area from outside, whether
by car or by public transportation, walk when they get there.

::: {#calibre_link-1451 .section_break}

Is it true that city diversity invites ruinous uses? Is permissiveness
for all (or almost all) kinds of uses in an area destructive?

To consider this, we need to consider several different kinds of
uses---some of which actually are harmful, and some of which are
conventionally considered to be harmful but are not.

One destructive category of uses, of which junk yards are an example,
contributes nothing to a district's general convenience, attraction, or
concentration of people. In return for nothing, these uses make
exorbitant demands upon the land---and upon esthetic tolerance. Used-car
lots are in this category. So are buildings which have been abandoned or
badly underused.

Probably everyone (except possibly the owners of such objects) is agreed
that this category of uses is blighting.

But it does not follow that junk yards and their like are therefore
threats which accompany city diversity. Successful city districts are
never dotted with junk yards, but that is not *why* these districts are
successful. It is the other way around. They lack junk yards *because*
they are successful.

[]{#calibre_link-1458 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="231"}Deadening
and space-taking low economic uses like junk yards and used-car lots
grow like pigweed in spots which are *already* uncultivated and
unsuccessful. They sprout in places that have low concentrations of foot
traffic, too little surrounding magnetism, and no high-value competition
for the space. Their natural homes are gray areas and the dwindled-off
edges of downtowns, where the fires of diversity and vitality burn low.
If all controls were lifted from housing-project malls, and these dead,
underused places found their natural economic level, junk yards and
used-car lots are exactly what would sprout in many of them.

The trouble represented by junk yards goes deeper than the Blight
Fighters can plumb. It achieves nothing to cry "Take them away! They
shouldn't be there!" The problem is to cultivate an economic environment
in the district which makes more vital uses of the land profitable and
logical. If this is not done, the land might as well be used for junk
yards, which after all have *some* use. Little else is apt to be
successful, and this includes public uses, like parks or school yards,
which fail catastrophically precisely where the economic environment is
too poor for other uses that depend on magnetism and surrounding
vitality. The kind of problem symbolized by junk yards, in short, is not
solved by fearing diversity, or by suppression, but rather by catalyzing
and cultivating a fertile economic environment for diversity.

A second category of uses is conventionally considered, by planners and
zoners, to be harmful, especially if these uses are mingled into
residential areas. This category includes bars, theaters, clinics,
businesses and manufacturing. It is a category which is not harmful; the
arguments that these uses are to be tightly controlled derive from their
effects in suburbs and in dull, inherently dangerous gray areas, not
from their effects in lively city districts.

Thin smatterings of nonresidential uses do little good in gray areas,
and can do harm, because gray areas are unequipped to handle
strangers---or to protect them either, for that matter. But again, this
is a problem that arises from too feeble a diversity in the prevailing
dullness and darkness.

In lively city districts, where abundant diversity has been catalyzed,
these uses do not do harm. They are positively necessary,
[]{#calibre_link-1463 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="232"}either for
their direct contributions to safety, public contact and cross-use, or
because they help support other diversity which has these direct
effects.

Work uses suggest another bugaboo: reeking smokestacks and flying ash.
Of course reeking smokestacks and flying ash are harmful, but it does
not follow that intensive city manufacturing (most of which produces no
such nasty by-products) or other work uses must be segregated from
dwellings. Indeed, the notion that reek or fumes are to be combated by
zoning and land-sorting classifications at all is ridiculous. The air
doesn't know about zoning boundaries. Regulations specifically aimed at
the smoke or the reek itself are to the point.

Among planners and zoners, the great shibboleth in land use was formerly
the glue factory. "Would you want a glue factory in your neighborhood?"
was the clincher. Why a glue factory I do not know, except possibly that
glue then meant dead horses and old fish, and the reference could be
counted upon to make nice people shudder and stop thinking. There used
to be a glue factory near us. It was in a small, attractive brick
building and was one of the cleanest-looking places on its block.

Nowadays, the glue factory has been replaced by a different bogy, the
"mortuary," which is trotted out as a crowning example of the horrors
that insinuate their way into neighborhoods which lack tight controls on
uses. Yet mortuaries, or funeral parlors as we call them in the city,
seem to do no harm. Perhaps in vital, diversified city neighborhoods, in
the midst of life, the reminder of death is not the pall it may be on
waning suburban streets. Curiously, the proponents of rigid use
controls, who object so firmly to death in the city, seem to object
equally firmly to life breaking out in the city.

One of the blocks of Greenwich Village which happens to be spontaneously
upgrading itself in attractiveness, interest and economic value, happens
also to have a funeral parlor on it as this is written, and has had for
years. Is this objectionable? Obviously it has been no deterrent to the
families who have put money into the rehabilitation of town houses on
the street, nor to the businessmen who have been investing money in
opening or refurbishing []{#calibre_link-1468 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="233"}quarters there, nor to the builder erecting a new high-rent
apartment.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-115){#calibre_link-119 .calibre7}

The strange idea that death should be an unnoticeable or unmentionable
part of city life was apparently debated in Boston a century ago, when
city improvers advocated the removal of the small old graveyards of
Boston's downtown churches. One Bostonian, Thomas Bridgman, whose views
prevailed, had this to say, "The burial place of the dead, so far as it
has any influence, is on the side of virtue and religion...Its voice is
one of perpetual rebuke to folly and sin."

The only clue I can find to the presumed harm wrought by funeral parlors
in cities is contained in *The Selection of Retail Locations*, by
Richard Nelson. Nelson proves statistically that people visiting funeral
parlors do not customarily combine this call with shopping errands.
Therefore, it is of no extra retail advantage to locate next to a
funeral parlor.

In low-income neighborhoods of big cities, such as New York's East
Harlem, funeral parlors can, and often do, operate as positive and
constructive forces. This is because a funeral parlor presupposes an
undertaker. Undertakers, like druggists, lawyers, dentists and
clergymen, are representatives, in these neighborhoods, of such
qualities as dignity, ambition and knowledgeability. They are typically
well-known public characters, active in local civic life. Quite often,
they eventually go into politics too.

Like so much of orthodox planning, the presumed harm done by this use
and that use has been somehow accepted without anyone's asking the
questions, "Why is it harmful? Just how does it do harm, and what is
this harm?" I doubt that there is any legal economic use (and few
illegal ones) which can harm a city district []{#calibre_link-1473
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="234"}as much as lack of abundant
diversity harms it. No special form of city blight is nearly so
devastating as the Great Blight of Dullness.

Having said this, I shall bring up a final category of uses which,
unless their location is controlled, are harmful in abundantly
diversified city districts. They can be numbered on one hand: parking
lots, large or heavy trucking depots, gas stations, gigantic outdoor
advertising[\*^4^](#calibre_link-116){#calibre_link-120 .calibre7} and
enterprises which are harmful not because of their nature, exactly, but
because *in certain streets* their scale is wrong.

All five of these problem uses are apt to be profitable enough (unlike
junk yards) to afford, and to seek, space in vital, diversified areas.
But at the same time they usually act as street desolators. Visually,
they are disorganizing to streets, and are so dominating that it is
hard---sometimes impossible---for any countering sense of order in
either street use or street appearance to make much impression.

The visual effects of the first four of these problem uses are easily
seen and often thought about. The uses themselves are the problem
because of the *kinds* of uses they are.

However, the fifth problem use I have mentioned is different, because in
this case the problem is *size* of use rather than *kind* of use. On
certain streets, any disproportionately large occupant of street
frontage is visually a street disintegrator and desolator, although
exactly the same *kinds* of uses, at small scale, do no harm and are
indeed an asset.

For example, many city "residential" streets shelter, along with their
dwellings, all kinds of commercial and working uses, and these can and
do fit in well so long as the street frontage which each one occupies is
no greater, say, than that taken up by the typical residence. Literally,
as well as figuratively, the uses fit in. The street has a visual
character which is consistent and basically orderly as well as various.

But on just such a street, a use that abruptly takes street frontage on
a large scale can appear to explode the street---make it fly apart in
fragments.

[]{#calibre_link-1481 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="235"}This
problem has nothing to do with use, in the usual zoning sense of use. A
restaurant or snack place, a grocery, a cabinetmaker, a printer's shop,
for instance, can fit well into such a street. But exactly the same
*kind* of use---say, a big cafeteria, a supermarket, a large woodworking
factory or a printing plant---can wreak visual havoc (and sometimes
auditory havoc) because it is on a different *scale*.

Such streets need controls to defend them from the ruin that completely
permissive diversity might indeed bring them. But the controls needed
are not controls on kinds of uses. The controls needed are controls on
the scale of street frontage permitted to a use.

This is so obvious and so ubiquitous a city problem that one would think
its solution must be among the concerns of zoning theory. Yet the very
existence of the problem is not even recognized in zoning theory. As
this is written, the New York City Planning Commission has been holding
hearings on a new, progressive, up-to-the-minute comprehensive zoning
resolution. Interested organizations and individuals in the city have
been invited to study, among other things, the proposed zoning
categories into which streets fall and to make recommendations for
shifts from one category to another if that seems desirable. There are
several dozen use categories, each differentiated most carefully and
thoughtfully---and all of them are irrelevant to the real-life problems
of use in diverse city districts.

What can you recommend, when the very theory behind such a zoning
resolution---not merely its detail---needs drastic overhaul and
rethinking? This sad circumstance has given rise to many a ludicrous
strategy session, for instance, in the civic organizations of Greenwich
Village. Many well-loved and popular residential side streets contain
mixtures and sprinklings of small establishments. These are generally
present by exemption from existing residential zoning, or are in
violation of the zoning. Everybody likes their presence, and no
arguments arise over their desirability. The arguments, rather, revolve
around the question of what kind of categories in the new zoning will be
least at odds with the needs of real life. The drawbacks of each offered
category are formidable. The argument against a commercial category for
[]{#calibre_link-1485 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="236"}such
streets is that, although it will permit the small-scale uses that are
an asset, it will also permit uses purely as uses, without regard to
scale; for instance, large supermarkets will be permitted and these are
greatly feared by residents as explosive to such streets and destructive
to residential street character---as they are. Ask for residential
categories, this argument continues, and then small establishments can
infiltrate in violation of the zoning as they have in the past. The
argument against a residential category is that somebody might actually
take it seriously and the zoning against "nonconforming" small-scale
uses might be enforced! Upright citizens, with the civic interests of
their neighborhoods genuinely at heart, sit soberly plotting as to what
regulation will offer the most constructive circumvention of itself.

The dilemma posed is urgent and real. One Greenwich Village street, for
example, recently came up against a version of precisely this problem
because of a case in the Board of Standards and Appeals. A bakery on
this street, at one time mainly retail and small, has grown vigorously
into a substantial wholesaler, and was applying for a zoning exemption
to expand considerably farther (taking over the quarters of a former
wholesale laundry next door). The street, which has long been zoned
"residential," has been upgrading itself recently, and many of its
property owners and renting residents, in their growing pride and
concern with their street, decided to fight the exemption request. They
lost. It is no wonder they lost, for their case was blurry. Some of the
leaders of the fight, who owned property or lived in property with
small-scale nonresidential uses on the ground floors, were themselves in
conflict, actual or sympathetic, with the "residential" zoning---just as
surely as the relatively big bakery was. However, precisely the many
small-scale nonresidential uses on the street, which have been
increasing, are responsible for much of the increased attractiveness and
value of the street for residence. They are acquisitions, and the people
on the street know it, for they make the street interesting and safe.
They include a real estate office, a small publishing company, a
bookshop, a restaurant, a picture framer, a cabinetmaker, a shop that
sells old posters and prints, a candy store, a coffee house, a laundry,
two groceries, and a small experimental theater.

[]{#calibre_link-1488 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="237"}I asked a
leader of the fight against the bakery exemption, a man who is also the
principal owner of rehabilitated residential property on the street,
which alternative in his opinion would do greater harm to his
residential property values: the gradual elimination of all
"nonresidential" uses on the street, or the expansion of the bakery. The
first alternative would be more destructive, he answered, but added,
"Isn't an implied choice of that kind absurd!"

It is absurd. A street like this is a puzzle and an anomaly under
conventional use-zoning theory. It is a puzzle even as a commercial
zoning problem. As city commercial zoning has become more "progressive"
(i.e., imitative of suburban conditions) it has begun to emphasize
distinctions between "local convenience shops," "district shopping," and
the like. The up-to-the-minute New York resolution has all this too. But
how do you classify such a street as this one with the bakery? It
combines the most purely localized conveniences (like the laundry and
the candy store) with district-wide attractions (like the cabinetmaker,
the picture framer, the coffee house) and with city-wide attractions
(like the theater, the art galleries, the poster shop). Its mixture is
unique, but the pattern of unclassifiable diversity which it represents
is not in the least unique. All lively, diversified city areas, full of
vitality and surprises, exist in another world from that of suburban
commerce.

By no means all city streets need zoning for scale of street frontage.
Many streets, particularly where large or wide buildings predominate,
whether for residential or for other uses or both, can contain
enterprises of large street frontages, and mix them with small ones too,
without appearing to explode and disintegrate, and without being
functionally overwhelmed by one use. Fifth Avenue has such mixtures of
large and small scale. But those city streets that do need scale zoning
need it badly, not just for their own sake but because the presence of
streets with consistent character adds diversity to the city scene
itself.

Raskin, in his essay on variety, suggested that the greatest flaw in
city zoning is that it *permits* monotony. I think this is correct.
Perhaps the next greatest flaw is that it ignores *scale* of use, where
this is an important consideration, or confuses it with *kind* of use,
[]{#calibre_link-1492 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="238"}and this
leads, on the one hand, to visual (and sometimes functional)
disintegration of streets, or on the other hand to indiscriminate
attempts to sort out and segregate kinds of uses no matter what their
size or empiric effect. Diversity itself is thus unnecessarily
suppressed, rather than one limited manifestation of it, unfortunate in
certain places.

To be sure, city areas with flourishing diversity sprout strange and
unpredictable uses and peculiar scenes. But this is not a drawback of
diversity. This is the point, or part of it. That this should happen is
in keeping with one of the missions of cities.

Paul J. Tillich, professor of theology at Harvard, observes:

> By its nature, the metropolis provides what otherwise could be given
> only by traveling; namely, the strange. Since the strange leads to
> questions and undermines familiar tradition, it serves to elevate
> reason to ultimate significance...There is no better proof of this
> fact than the attempts of all totalitarian authorities to keep the
> strange from their subjects...The big city is sliced into pieces, each
> of which is observed, purged and equalized. The mystery of the strange
> and the critical rationality of men are both removed from the city.

This is an idea familiar to those who appreciate and enjoy cities,
although it is usually expressed more lightly. Kate Simon, author of
*New York Places and Pleasures*, is saying much the same thing when she
suggests, "Take the children to Grant's \[restaurant\]...they may bump
into people whose like they may never see elsewhere and may possibly
never forget."

The very existence of popular city guidebooks, with their emphases on
the discovery, the curious, the different, are an illustration of
Professor Tillich's point. Cities have the capability of providing
something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created
by everybody.

# The self-destruction of diversity {#calibre_link-1510 .chaphead1}
:::

My observations and conclusions thus far sum up to this: In our American
cities, we need all kinds of diversity, intricately mingled in mutual
support. We need this so city life can work decently and constructively,
and so the people of cities can sustain (and further develop) their
society and civilization. Public and quasi-public bodies are responsible
for some of the enterprises that help make up city diversity---for
instance, parks, museums, schools, most auditoriums, hospitals, some
offices, some dwellings. However, most city diversity is the creation of
incredible numbers of different people and different private
organizations, with vastly differing ideas and purposes, planning and
contriving outside the formal framework of public action. The main
responsibility of city planning and design should be to
develop---insofar as public policy and action can do so---cities that
are congenial places for this great range of unofficial plans, ideas and
opportunities to flourish, along with the flourishing of the public
enterprises. City districts []{#calibre_link-1512 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="242"}will be economically and socially congenial
places for diversity to generate itself and reach its best potential if
the districts possess good mixtures of primary uses, frequent streets, a
close-grained mingling of different ages in their buildings, and a high
concentration of people.

In this group of chapters on decline and regeneration, I intend to dwell
on several powerful forces that can influence, for good or for ill, the
growth of diversity and vitality in cities, once an area is not crippled
by lack of one or more of the four conditions necessary for generating
diversity.

These forces, in the form that they work for ill, are: the tendency for
outstandingly successful diversity in cities to destroy itself; the
tendency for massive single elements in cities (many of which are
necessary and otherwise desirable) to cast a deadening influence; the
tendency for population instability to counter the growth of diversity;
and the tendency for both public and private money either to glut or to
starve development and change.

These forces are interrelated, to be sure; all factors in city changes
are interrelated with all other factors. Nevertheless, it is possible
and useful to look at each of these forces in its own right. The purpose
of recognizing and understanding them is to try to combat them
or---better yet---convert them into constructive forces. Besides
influencing the growth of diversity itself, these forces also sometimes
affect the ease or difficulty with which the basic conditions for
generating diversity can be introduced. Leaving them out of account,
even the best planning for vitality would fall a step back for every two
steps forward.

The first of these powerful forces is the tendency for outstanding
success in cities to destroy itself---purely as a result of being
successful. In this chapter I shall discuss the self-destruction of
diversity, a force which, among its other effects, causes our downtowns
continually to shift their centers and move. This is a force that
creates has-been districts, and is responsible for much inner-city
stagnation and decay.

::: {#calibre_link-1517 .section_break}

:::

The self-destruction of diversity can happen in streets, at small nodes
of vitality, in groupings of streets, or in whole districts. The last
case is the most serious.

[]{#calibre_link-1520 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="243"}Whichever
form the self-destruction takes, this, in broad strokes, is what
happens: A diversified mixture of uses at some place in the city becomes
outstandingly popular and successful as a whole. Because of the
location's success, which is invariably based on flourishing and
magnetic diversity, ardent competition for space in this locality
develops. It is taken up in what amounts to the economic equivalent of a
fad.

The winners in the competition for space will represent only a narrow
segment of the many uses that together created success. Whichever one or
few uses have emerged as the most profitable in the locality will be
repeated and repeated, crowding out and overwhelming less profitable
forms of use. If tremendous numbers of people, attracted by convenience
and interest, or charmed by vigor and excitement, choose to live or work
in the area, again the winners of the competition will form a narrow
segment of population of users. Since so many want to get in, those who
get in or stay in will be self-sorted by the expense.

Competition based on retail profitability is most apt to affect streets.
Competition based on working- or living-space attraction is most apt to
affect whole groupings of streets, or even whole districts.

Thus, from this process, one or few dominating uses finally emerge
triumphant. But the triumph is hollow. A most intricate and successful
organism of economic mutual support and social mutual support has been
destroyed by the process.

From this point on, the locality will gradually be deserted by people
using it for purposes other than those that emerged triumphant from the
competition---because the other purposes are no longer there. Both
visually and functionally, the place becomes more monotonous. All the
economic disadvantages of people being spread insufficiently through
time of day are likely to follow. The locality's suitability even for
its predominant use will gradually decline, as the suitability of
downtown Manhattan for managerial offices has declined because of this
reason. In time, a place that was once so successful and once the object
of such ardent competition, wanes and becomes marginal.

Many streets which have already gone through this process and are at
rest in their moribundity can be seen in our cities. Others,
[]{#calibre_link-1526 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="244"}caught in
the process now, can be watched in action. Among those in the
neighborhood where I live is Eighth Street, the principal commercial
street of Greenwich Village. Thirty-five years ago, this was a
nondescript street. Then one of its principal property owners, Charles
Abrams (who happens also to be an exceptionally enlightened planning and
housing expert), built on the street a small night club and a
motion-picture theater unusual for its time. (The narrow auditorium for
good screen viewing, the coffee lounge and the intimate atmosphere have
since been widely copied.) These enterprises proved popular. They
brought more people into the street during evening hours and week ends,
to supplement the day people passing through, and thus helped stimulate
the growth of convenience and special shops. These, in their own right,
began to bring still more people, day and evening. As I have mentioned
previously, a two-shift street like this is an economically sound place
for restaurants. The history of Eighth Street began to bear this out. It
acquired an interesting growth and range of restaurants.

Among all the enterprises of Eighth Street, it happened that restaurants
became the largest money-earners per square foot of space. Naturally it
followed that Eighth Street went more and more to restaurants. Meantime,
at its Fifth Avenue corner, a diversity of clubs, galleries and some
small offices were crowded out by blank, monolithic, very high-rent
apartments. The only unusual factor in this history is Abrams himself.
Unlike most property owners, who might not have pondered the
implications of what was occurring, or have seen reason for worry in the
face of success, Abrams watched, with dismay, bookstores, galleries,
clubs, craftsmen and one-of-a-kind shops being pushed out. He watched
new ideas starting up in other streets, and fewer new ideas coming to
Eighth Street. He could see that some of this movement was helping to
enliven and diversify other streets, but he could also see that Eighth
Street was slowly but steadily starting to undiversify itself. He
realized that if the process ran its full and logical course, Eighth
Street would eventually be left beached, in the wake of popularity that
had moved away. For much of his own property, in a strategic stretch of
the street, Abrams has thus deliberately searched out tenants who will
add []{#calibre_link-1528 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="245"}something other than restaurants to the mixture. But
sometimes he has to search hard for them because they must reasonably
approach the current high earning power of restaurants. This narrows
down the possibilities---even purely commercial possibilities. Eighth
Street's worst potential threat to its diversity and its long-term
success is, in short, the force let loose by outstanding success.

Another nearby street, Third Street, is far advanced in a similar
trouble, because of another kind of sorting. This street, for a stretch
of several blocks, has become immensely popular with tourists, drawn
first by the local bohemian life of coffee houses and neighborhood bars,
with---at first---a light sprinkling of night clubs, all mingled with
the interesting neighborhood shops and residential life of a stable old
Italian and artists' district. In their proportions of fifteen years
ago, the evening visitors were a constructive part of the area's
mixture. The general liveliness they helped create was part of the
residential appeal, as well as an appeal to visitors. Night spots are
today overwhelming the street, and are also overwhelming the very life
of the area. Into a district excellent at handling and protecting
strangers they have concentrated too many strangers, all in too
irresponsible a mood, for any conceivable city society to handle
naturally. The duplication of the most profitable use is undermining the
base of its own attraction, as disproportionate duplication and
exaggeration of some single use always does in cities.

We are accustomed to thinking of streets, or neighborhoods of streets,
as divided into functional uses---entertainment, offices, residence,
shopping or the like. And so they are, but only to a degree if they
maintain their success. For example, streets which become so profitable
for such secondary diversity as clothing shopping that clothing shopping
becomes almost their exclusive use, decline as they are progressively
deserted and ignored by people with other secondary purposes in mind. If
such a street has long blocks, which further degenerate it as a pool of
intricate cross-use, the sorting out of its users, and the resulting
stagnation, is emphasized. And if such a street belongs in a district
which, in general, is sorting into one primary use---such as
work---there is seldom hope for any spontaneous turn for the better.

[]{#calibre_link-1532 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="246"}The
self-destruction of diversity can be seen at outstandingly successful
little nodes of activity, as well as along street stretches. The process
is the same. As an example, consider the crossing of Chestnut and Broad
Streets in Philadelphia, a spot which a few years ago was a climax of
Chestnut Street's varied shopping and other activities. The corners of
this crossing were what real estate men call a "100 percent location."
It was an enviable place to be. One of the corner occupants was a bank.
Three other banks bought themselves into the three other corners,
apparently to be at the 100 percent location too. From that moment, it
was no longer the 100 percent location. The crossing is today a dead
barrier along Chestnut Street, and the tumble of diversity and activity
has been pushed beyond.

These banks were making the same mistake as a family I know who bought
an acre in the country on which to build a house. For many years, while
they lacked the money to build, they visited the site regularly and
picnicked on a knoll, the site's most attractive feature. They liked so
much to visualize themselves as always there, that when they finally
built they put the house on the knoll. But then the knoll was gone.
Somehow they had not realized they would destroy it and lose it by
supplanting it with themselves.

::: {#calibre_link-1534 .section_break}

Streets (especially if their blocks are short) sometimes can weather
much duplication of successful uses, or else can regenerate themselves
spontaneously after declining and stagnating for a time. These escapes
are possible if the surrounding district sustains a strong and vigorous
mixture of diversity---especially a strong, underlying base of primary
diversity.

However, when whole neighborhoods of streets, and entire districts,
embark on excessive duplication of the most profitable or prestigious
uses, the problem is far more serious.

Striking evidences of this disastrous sorting-out can be seen in many
city downtowns. The successive historical centers of Boston's downtown,
like so many archeological layers, are fossilized as stratum after
stratum of sorted-out uses, each stratum lacking primary mixture, each
stratum stagnated. The Boston Planning Board, analyzing downtown uses,
mapped them by color---one []{#calibre_link-1538 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="247"}color to designate managerial and financial
offices, another for government, another for shopping, another for
entertainment, and so on. The stagnant areas all show on the map as a
series of virtually solid swatches of a single color each. On the other
hand, at one end of the downtown, where the Back Bay meets a corner of
the Public Gardens, is a swatch of map marked with a different kind of
legend, designated in red and yellow stripes. This swatch was too
complex to map according to specific uses, so it was given an
appropriate representational legend, standing for "mixed." This is the
only part of Boston's downtown that is at present spontaneously
changing, growing, acting like a live city.

Such successions of sorted-out downtown neighborhoods as those in Boston
are generally thought of, vaguely, as the residue left by a moving
downtown center. They are regarded as a result of the center's movement
elsewhere. But they are not. These clumps of excessive duplication are
the *cause* of the center's movement. Diversity is crowded out by the
duplication of success. Unless they are handsomely financed to start
with, or instantly successful (which is seldom the case), new ideas
tumble into second-best locations; thereby second-best becomes
first-rate, flourishes for a time, and eventually it too is destroyed by
the duplication of its own greatest successes.

In New York, the sorting-out of downtown was already being memorialized
back in the 1880's, in a jingle of the time:

> From Eighth Street down, the men are earning it.
>
> From Eighth Street up, the women are spending it.
>
> That is the manner of this great town,
>
> From Eighth Street up and Eighth Street down.

Willa Gather, writing in *My Mortal Enemy* of Madison Square as its turn
arrived to become an intense center of diversity, described it thus:
"Madison Square was then at the parting of the ways; had a double
personality, half commercial, half social, with shops to the south and
residences on the north."

Miss Gather put her finger on the characteristic of mixture and "double
personality" that always marks an outstandingly successful center as it
approaches its crest and poises there. But the mixture
[]{#calibre_link-1547 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="248"}hardly
represents a "parting of the ways." It is a coming together and mingling
of the ways.

Madison Square, now a glum, has-been district of massive office
buildings and a commerce very marginal in comparison to that it once
enjoyed, was remarkable at its crest for possessing the old Madison
Square Garden (now supplanted by an office building). Never since has
New York had such an urbane, glamorous and magnetic assembly hall,
because never since has New York had a major assembly hall at the
magnetic, expensive center of a good mixture.

The eventual sorting out and long decline of Madison Square was not, of
course, an isolated event. It was part of a larger movement, made up of
many accumulations of economic pressure upon successful mixtures of
uses. On a larger scale than Madison Square, these pressures of
competition for space were continually unsorting diversity throughout
the entire middle of downtown, and tumbling diversity out at the upper
end of downtown; downtown itself was moving as a result, leaving its
beached districts behind.

A moving downtown usually leaves, along with its clumps of excessive
duplication, pockets of nothing much at all, places which the most
intensive new combinations of diversity have bypassed or over which they
have leapfrogged. These pockets or side strips are apt to remain nothing
much at all thenceforth, because the sorted-out clumps adjoining them
provide so poor a spread of people through time of day. There is space
here, but nothing to catalyze uses for it.

Apparently the self-destruction of district diversity by excessive
duplication occurs in London too, because of the same forces that move
American downtowns. An article on the planning problems of Central
London, in the January 1959 *Journal of the Town Planning Institute,* a
British periodical, has this to say:

> For many years now variety has gone from the City \[the bank and
> financial office center\]. There the teeming daytime population
> contrasts with a 5,000 night population. What has happened in the City
> is happening to the West End. The claim of many who have offices in

> []{#calibre_link-1553 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="249"}they have
> the amenities of the hotels, the clubs, the restaurants and for their
> staff the shops and the parks. If the process goes on, these very
> advantages will be gobbled up and the West End will become one dreary
> sea of office blocks.

We have pitifully few outstandingly successful residential districts in
our American cities; most city residential districts have never
possessed the four fundamental conditions for generating exuberant
diversity in the first place. Therefore, examples of the
self-destruction that follows outstanding success are more usual in
downtowns. But the relatively few city residential districts that do
become outstandingly magnetic and successful at generating diversity and
vitality are subjected ultimately to the same forces of self-destruction
as downtowns. In this case, so many people want to live in the locality
that it becomes profitable to build, in excessive and devastating
quantity, for those who can pay the most. These are usually childless
people, and today they are not simply people who can pay the most in
general, but people who can or will pay the most for the smallest space.
Accommodations for this narrow, profitable segment of population
multiply, at the expense of all other tissue and all other population.
Families are crowded out, variety of scene is crowded out, enterprises
unable to support their share of the new construction costs are crowded
out. This process is now occurring, very rapidly, in much of Greenwich
Village, Yorkville and the midtown East Side of Manhattan. The uses
duplicated excessively are different from those duplicated excessively
at centers of downtowns, but the process is the same, the reason why it
occurs is the same, and the ultimate effects are the same. The admired
and magnetic knoll is destroyed by its own new occupants, by the act of
occupation.

::: {#calibre_link-1555 .section_break}
---
:::

The process I have described occurs only in small areas at a time,
because it is a sequel only to outstanding success. Nevertheless, the
destructive power of this process is larger and more serious than its
geographical scope at any one time suggests. The very fact that the
process does occur in localities of outstanding success makes it
difficult for our cities to build further upon outstanding success. It
too often slips into decline.

[]{#calibre_link-1558 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="250"}Furthermore, the very means by which outstanding success
declines make the process doubly destructive to cities. At the same time
new construction and narrow multiplications of uses are destroying
mutual support in one locality, they are, in effect, depriving other
localities of their presence, localities where they would *add* to
diversity and strengthen mutual support, rather than subtract these
qualities.

For some reason, banks, insurance companies and prestige offices are
consistently the most voracious double-destroyers in this way. Look to
see where banks or insurance companies are clustered, and you will too
often see where a center of diversity has been supplanted, a knoll of
vitality leveled. You will see a place that is already a has-been or is
becoming so. I suspect that this curious circumstance is owing to two
facts. Such organizations are conservative. Conservatism, applied to the
choice of city locations, means investing where success is already a
well-established fact. To see that investment may destroy success
requires looking too far ahead for those who value most what is already
achieved---and are perhaps mystified by localities with a potential for
success, or are insecure about them, because of not understanding why
some places in cities should be successful, and others not. In the
second place, such organizations have money, and thus are able to
supplant most rivals for the space they want. The wish and the ability
to settle on the knoll are thus combined most effectively in banks and
insurance companies, and in prestige offices---which borrow readily from
banks and insurance companies. To a certain extent, the convenience of
being very close to one another is important, as it is in many other
city activities. But this hardly accounts for the accuracy and degree
with which such powerful organizations supplant successful combinations
of diversity. Once a locality has been stagnated by their excessive
duplication of work uses (at the expense of other tissue), the more
prosperous among them readily leave the nest of convenience which is no
longer so appealing.

However, it would be misleading to fix upon particular culprits among
differing city uses, even outstanding culprits. Too many other uses
exert the same economic pressures and end with the same hollow triumphs.

[]{#calibre_link-1562 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="251"}It is more
fruitful, I think, to approach this as a problem of malfunction in
cities themselves.

First, we must understand that self-destruction of diversity is caused
by success, not by failure.

Second, we must understand that the process is a continuation of the
same economic processes that led to the success itself, and were
indispensable to it. Diversity grows in a city area because of economic
opportunity and economic attraction. During the process of diversity
growth, rival users of space are crowded out. All city diversity grows,
in part at least, at the expense of some other tissue. During this
growth period even some unique uses may be crowded out because they give
such low economic return for the land they occupy. This we think of as
salutary if the unique uses are junk yards, used-car lots or abandoned
buildings; and it *is* salutary. During the growth period, much of the
new diversity occurs not merely at the expense of uniquely low-value
tissue, but also at the expense of already existing duplications of use.
Sameness is being subtracted at the same time diversity is being added.
This result of economic competition for space is net increase in
diversity.

At some point the diversity growth has proceeded so far that the
addition of new diversity is mainly in competition with already existing
diversity. Relatively little sameness is being subtracted, perhaps none.
This is the case when a center of activity and diversity has reached a
peak. If the addition is really something different (as the first bank
on the corner in Philadelphia was), there is still no net loss in
diversity.

Here is a process, then, that operates for a time as a healthy and
salutary function, but by failing to modify itself at a critical point
becomes a malfunction. The analogy that comes to mind is faulty
feedback.

The conception of electronic feedback has become familiar with the
development of computers and automated machinery, where one of the end
products of an act or series of acts by the machine is a signal which
modifies and guides the next act. A similar feedback process, regulated
chemically rather than electronically, is now believed to modify some of
the behavior of cells. A report in the *New York Times* explains it
thus:

[]{#calibre_link-1569 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="252"}The
presence of an end product in the milieu of a cell causes the machinery
that produces the end product to slow down or to stop. This form of cell
behavior Dr. \[Van R.\] Potter \[of the University of Wisconsin Medical
School\] characterized as "intelligent." In contrast, a cell that has
changed or mutated behaves like an "idiot" in that it continues without
feedback regulation to produce even materials that it does not require.

::: {#calibre_link-1570 .section_break}
---
:::

I think that last sentence is a fair description of the behavior of city
localities where the success of diversity destroys itself.

Suppose we think of successful city areas, for all their extraordinary
and intricate economic and social order, as faulty in this fashion. In
creating city success, we human beings have created marvels, but we left
out feedback. What can we do with cities to make up for this omission?

::: {#calibre_link-1573 .section_break}
---
:::

I doubt that we can provide for cities anything equivalent to a true
feedback system, working automatically and with perfection. But I think
we can accomplish much with imperfect substitutes.

The problem is to hamper excess duplications at one place, and divert
them instead to other places in which they will not be excess
duplications, but healthy additions. The other places may be at some
distance, or very close by indeed. But in any case they cannot be fixed
on arbitrarily. They *must* be places where the use concerned will have
an excellent opportunity for sustained success---a better opportunity,
in fact, than in a locality that is doomed to destroy itself.

I think this diversion can be encouraged by a combination of three
means, which I shall call: zoning for diversity; staunchness of public
buildings; and competitive diversion. I shall touch on each of these
briefly.

Zoning for diversity must be thought of differently from the usual
zoning for conformity, but like all zoning it is suppressive. One form
of zoning for diversity is already familiar in certain city districts:
controls against demolition of historically valuable buildings. Already
different from their surroundings, these are zoned to stay different
from them. A slightly advanced development of this concept was proposed
by Greenwich Village civic groups for their area, and adopted by the
city, in 1959. On certain streets, []{#calibre_link-1578 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="253"}the height limitations for buildings were
drastically reduced. Most of the streets affected already contain
numerous buildings in excess of the new height limitations. This is not
evidence of illogic, but is precisely why the new limitations were
asked: so that the lower buildings remaining could not be further
replaced by excessive duplication of the more valuable high buildings.
Again, sameness was being zoned out---or in effect, differences zoned
in---even though in a most limited fashion and on relatively few
streets.

The purpose of zoning for deliberate diversity should not be to freeze
conditions and uses as they stand. That would be death. Rather, the
point is to insure that changes or replacements, as they do occur,
cannot be overwhelmingly of one kind. This means, often, constraints on
too rapid a replacement of too many buildings. I think the specific
scheme of diversity zoning, or the specific combination of schemes, that
an outstandingly successful city locality requires is likely to differ
with the locality and with the particular form of self-destruction that
threatens it. However, in principle, zoning aimed directly at building
ages and building sizes is a logical tool, because variety in types of
accommodations is reflected, usually, in variety of uses and
populations. A park being surrounded by intensive duplications of tall
offices or apartments might well be zoned for lower buildings along its
south side in particular, thus accomplishing two useful purposes at one
stroke: protecting the park's supply of winter sun, and protecting
indirectly, to some extent at least, its diversity of surrounding uses.

All such zoning for diversity---since the deliberate intent is to
prevent excessive duplication of the most profitable uses---needs to be
accompanied by tax adjustments. Land hampered from conversion to its
most immediately profitable potential use needs to have this fact
reflected in its taxes. It is unrealistic to put a ceiling on a
property's development (whether the tool is control of height, bulk,
historical or esthetic value, or some other device) and then let the
assessment on such a property reflect the irrelevant values of more
profitably developed properties nearby. Indeed, raising the assessments
on city property because of increased profitability of the neighbors, is
a powerful means today of forcing []{#calibre_link-1581 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="254"}excess duplications. This pressure would
continue to force them, even in the face of controls overtly intended to
hamper duplications. The way to raise the tax base of a city is not at
all to exploit to the limit the short-term tax potential of every site.
This undermines the long-term tax potential of whole neighborhoods. The
way to raise a city's tax base is to expand the city's territorial
quantity of successful areas. A strong city tax base is a by-product of
strong city magnetism, and one of its necessary ingredients---once the
object is to sustain success---is a certain amount of close-grained,
deliberate, calculated variation in localized tax yields to anchor
diversity and forestall its self-destruction.

The second potential tool for hampering unbridled duplication of uses is
what I call staunchness of public buildings. By this I mean that public
and quasi-public bodies should adopt, for their properties, a policy
somewhat like Charles Abrams' private policy for his property on Eighth
Street. Abrams combats the excessive duplication of restaurants on his
property by seeking other kinds of uses. Public and quasi-public bodies
should establish their buildings and facilities at points where these
will add effectively to diversity in the first place (rather than
duplicate their neighbors). Then, in their role as uses, these should
stand staunch, no matter how valuable the property becomes because of
surrounding success (which they have helped create if they located
well), and no matter how large the offers from those who would supplant
them to duplicate surrounding successful uses. This is a penny-foolish
but pound-wise policy for municipalities and for bodies having an
enlightened stake in municipal success---analogous to penny-foolish but
pound-wise taxation policy for enforcing diversity zoning devices. The
New York Public Library, on an immensely valuable site, contributes more
of value to the locality than any possible profitable duplication of
nearby uses---because it is so different, visually and functionally.
When pressure from citizens persuaded New York's city government to lend
funds to a quasi-public body, so it could buy Carnegie Hall from its
private owner who was going to sell it for duplication of nearby uses,
and Carnegie Hall was thus retained as a concert hall and auditorium, a
continuing effective mixture of primary uses in the neighborhood was
thereby anchored. In short, public and public-spirited
[]{#calibre_link-1583 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="255"}bodies can
do much to anchor diversity by standing staunch in the midst of
*different* surrounding uses, while money rolls around them and begs to
roll over them.

Both of these tools, zoning for diversity and staunchness of public
uses, are defensive actions against self-destruction of diversity. They
are windbreaks, so to speak, which can stand against the gusts of
economic pressures, but can hardly be expected to stand fast against
sustained gales. Any forms of zoning, any forms of public building
policy, any forms of tax assessment policy, no matter how enlightened,
give eventually under sufficiently powerful economic pressure. They
usually have, and probably they usually will.

Along with defensive tools must therefore go another: competitive
diversion.

There is a widespread belief that Americans hate cities. I think it is
probable that Americans hate city failure, but, from the evidence, we
certainly do not hate successful and vital city areas. On the contrary,
so many people want to make use of such places, so many people want to
work in them or live in them or visit in them, that municipal
self-destruction ensues. In killing successful diversity combinations
with money, we are employing perhaps our nearest equivalent to killing
with kindness.

In short, the demand for lively and diversified city areas is too great
for the supply.

If outstandingly successful city localities are to withstand the forces
of self-destruction---and if the nuisance value of defense against
self-destruction is to be an effective nuisance value---the sheer supply
of diversified, lively, economically viable city localities must be
increased. And with this, we are back to the basic need to supply *more*
city streets and districts with the four conditions economically
necessary to city diversity.

To be sure, there will always be some districts, at any particular
moment in time, which are most exuberantly diversified, most popular and
most tempting for destruction by momentarily most profitable
duplications. If other localities are not far behind in opportunities
and interest, however, and still others are coming along, these can
offer competitive diversion from the most popular. Their pull would be
reinforced by the obstacles to duplications []{#calibre_link-1590
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="256"}introduced in the most popular
districts, which are a necessary adjunct to competitive diversion. But
the competitive pull would have to be there, even though it could be a
lesser pull.

If and when competing localities, in their turn, should become
sufficiently successful to need city substitutes for feedback signals,
they should ask and get defenses against excessive duplication.

The time at which a city locality starts to act like an "idiot" cell is
not hard to discover. Anyone intimate with an outstandingly successful
city district knows when this qualitative turn is in process of
occurring. Those who use the facilities that are starting to disappear,
or view them with pleasure, know full well when the diversity and
interest of the locality to which they are attached are on the
downgrade. They know full well when segments of the population are being
crowded out, and diversity of population is narrowing---especially if
they are being crowded out themselves. They even know many of these
results in advance of their fulfillment, by projecting proposed or
imminent physical changes into changes in everyday life and the everyday
scene. The people in a district talk about it, they register both the
fact and effect of diversity's self-destruction long before slowpoke
maps and statistics tell, too late, the misfortune of what happened.

At bottom, this problem of the self-destruction of outstanding success
is the problem of getting the supply of vital, diversified city streets
and districts into a saner relationship with demand.

# The curse of border vacuums {#calibre_link-1598 .chaphead1}
:::

Massive single uses in cities have a quality in common with each other.
They form borders, and borders in cities usually make destructive
neighbors.

A border---the perimeter of a single massive or stretched-out use of
territory---forms the edge of an area of "ordinary" city. Often borders
are thought of as passive objects, or matter-of-factly just as edges.
However, a border exerts an active influence.

Railroad tracks are the classic examples of borders, so much so that
they came to stand, long ago, for social borders too---"the other side
of the tracks"---a connotation, incidentally, associated with small
towns rather than with big cities. Here we shall be concerned not with
the social connotations of areas demarcated by borders, but rather with
the physical and functional effects of borders on their immediate city
surroundings.

In the case of a railroad track, the district lying to one side may
[]{#calibre_link-1603 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="258"}do better
or worse than the district lying to the other side. But the places that
do worst of all, physically, are typically the zones directly beside the
track, on both sides. Whatever lively and diverse growth occurs to
either side, whatever replacement of the old or worn-out occurs, is
likely to happen beyond these zones, inward, away from the tracks. The
zones of low value and decay which we are apt to find beside the tracks
in our cities appear to afflict everything within the zones except the
buildings that make direct, practical use of the track itself or its
sidings. This is curious, because we can often see, looking at the
ingredients in the decline and decay, that at one time some people did
see fit to put new buildings, even ambitious buildings, in this zone of
decline.

The blight-proneness of zones along the tracks has usually been
explained as a result of the noise, the soot of steam locomotive days,
and the general undesirability of railroad tracks as an environment.
However, I think these disadvantages are only part of the cause, and
perhaps a minor part. Why did they not discourage development there in
the first place?

Furthermore, we can see that the same sort of blight typically occurs
along city waterfronts. Usually it is worse and there is more of it
along the waterfronts than along the tracks. Yet waterfronts are not
inherently noisy, dirty or disagreeable environments.

It is curious, too, how frequently the immediate neighborhoods
surrounding big-city university campuses, City Beautiful civic centers,
large hospital grounds, and even large parks, are extraordinarily
blight-prone, and how frequently, even when they are not smitten by
physical decay, they are apt to be stagnant---a condition that precedes
decay.

Yet if conventional planning and land-use theory were true, and if quiet
and cleanliness had as much positive effect as they are supposed to,
exactly these disappointing zones should be outstandingly successful
economically, and vital socially.

Different as railroad tracks, waterfronts, campuses, expressways, large
parking areas and large parks are from each other in most ways, they
also have much in common with each other---so far as their tendency to
exist amid moribund or declining surroundings []{#calibre_link-1609
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="259"}is concerned. And if we look at
the parts of cities most literally attractive---i.e., those that
literally attract people, in the flesh---we find that these fortunate
localities are seldom in the zones immediately adjoining massive single
uses.

The root trouble with borders, as city neighbors, is that they are apt
to form dead ends for most users of city streets. They represent, for
most people, most of the time, barriers.

Consequently, the street that adjoins a border is a terminus of
generalized use. If this street, which is the end of the line for people
in the area of "ordinary" city, also gets little or no use from people
inside the single-use border-forming territory, it is bound to be a
deadened place, with scant users. This deadness can have further
repercussions. Because few people use the immediate border street, the
side streets (and in some cases the parallel street) adjoining it are
also less used as a result. They fail to get a by-the-way circulation of
people going beyond them in the direction of the border, because few are
going to that Beyond. If those adjoining streets, therefore, become too
empty and therefore in turn are shunned, their adjoining streets may
also be less used. And so it goes, until the forces of heavy use from an
area of strong attraction come into counterplay.

Borders can thus tend to form vacuums of use adjoining them. Or to put
it another way, by oversimplifying the use of the city at one place, on
a large scale, they tend to simplify the use which people give to the
adjoining territory too, and this simplification of use---meaning fewer
users, with fewer different purposes and destinations at hand---feeds
upon itself. The more infertile the simplified territory becomes for
economic enterprises, the still fewer the users, and the still more
infertile the territory. A kind of unbuilding, or running-down process
is set in motion.

This is serious, because literal and continuous mingling of people,
present because of different purposes, is the only device that keeps
streets safe. It is the only device that cultivates secondary diversity.
It is the only device that encourages districts to form in place of
fragmented, self-isolated neighborhoods or backwaters.

Abstract or more indirect support among differing city uses (helpful
though this may be on another plane) does not serve such purposes.

[]{#calibre_link-1616 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="260"}Sometimes
visible evidence of the running-down process is almost as graphic as a
diagram. This is the case in some parts of the Lower East Side of New
York; it is especially striking at night. At the borders of the dark and
empty grounds of the massive, low-income housing projects, the streets
are dark and empty of people too. Stores, except for a few sustained by
the project dwellers themselves, have gone out of business, and many
quarters stand unused and empty. Street by street, as you move away from
the project borders, a little more life is to be found, progressively a
little more brightness, but it takes many streets before the gradual
increase of economic activity and movement of people become strong. And
each year the vacuum seems to eat a little farther in. Neighborhoods or
streets caught between two such borders close together can be utterly
deadened, border to border.

Sometimes a newspaper account describes some vivid incident of the
running-down process---for example, this account of an event in February
1960 from the *New York Post:*

> The slaying in Cohen's butcher shop at 164 E. 174th St. Monday night
> was no isolated incident, but the culmination of a series of
> burglaries and holdups along the street...Ever since work started on
> the Cross-Bronx Expressway across the street some two years ago, a

> on the owner of a nearby drug store, which remains open to 10
> [P]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}. "We're scared to death," he commented.
> "We're the only store that stays open that late."

Sometimes we can infer the formation of such vacuums, as when a
newspaper advertisement lists an amazing bargain---a ten-room brick
house, recently rehabilitated, with new copper plumbing, to be sold for
\$12,000---and the address pins down its location: between the borders
of a huge project and an expressway.

Sometimes the main effect is the gradual, progressive spread, from
street to street, of simple sidewalk insecurity. Morningside
[]{#calibre_link-1621 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="261"}Heights in
New York contains a long, narrow strip of neighborhood edged on one side
by a campus and on the other side by a long waterfront park. This strip
is further interrupted by the barriers of intervening institutions.
Every place you go in this strip brings you quickly to a border. The
most shunned of these borders by evening, for decades, has been that of
the park. But gradually and almost imperceptibly, the common consent
that insecurity exists has affected more and more of the territory,
until today there is only one side of one street that carries more than
solitary footfalls at night. This one-sided street, a stretch of
Broadway, is across from the deadened perimeter of the big campus; and
even it dies off through much of the strip, where it becomes preempted
by another border.

But in most cases, there is nothing dramatic in any way about a border
vacuum. Rather, vitality just appears absent and the condition is apt to
be taken for granted. Here is a good characterization of a vacuum, in
*The Wapshot Chronicle,* a novel by John Cheever: "North of the park you
come into a neighborhood that seems blighted---not persecuted, but only
unpopular, as if it suffered acne or bad breath, and it has a bad
complexion---colorless and seamed and missing a feature here and there."

The exact reasons for scantness of use at a border vary.

Some borders damp down use by making travel across them a one-way
affair. Housing projects are examples of this. The project people cross
back and forth across the border (usually, in any appreciable numbers,
at only one side of the project or at most two sides). The adjoining
people, for the most part, stay strictly over on their side of the
border and treat the line as a dead end or use.

Some borders halt cross-use from both sides. Open railroad tracks or
expressways or water barriers are common examples.

Some borders have cross-use from both directions, but it is limited, in
appreciable amounts, to daylight or it falls off drastically at certain
times of year. Large parks are common examples.

Still other borders have scant use along them because the massive single
elements that form them possess such a low intensity of land use,
relative to the great perimeters they possess. Civic centers with large
grounds are common examples. The New []{#calibre_link-1628 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="262"}York City Planning Commission is trying, as
this is written, to institute an industrial park in Brooklyn, and has
announced that this will consist of 100 acres, and will accommodate
firms employing about 3,000 workers. Thirty workers to an acre is so
low-intensity a use of city land, and 100 acres affords such an immense
perimeter, that this enterprise will create scant use all along its
borders.

From whichever cause the effect is produced, the pertinent effect is
scant use (few users, there in the flesh) along a large-scale or
stretched-out perimeter.

The phenomenon of border vacuums is baffling to city designers,
especially to those who sincerely value urban liveliness and variety and
dislike both deadness and nondescript sprawl. Borders, they sometimes
reason, are a feasible means of heightening intensity, and of giving a
city a sharp, clear form, as medieval town walls apparently did with
medieval towns. This is a plausible idea, because some borders
undoubtedly do serve to concentrate, and thereby intensify, city areas.
The water barriers of San Francisco and of Manhattan have both had this
effect.

And yet, even when a major border has concentrated city intensity, as in
those cases, the zone along the border itself seldom reflects that
intensity, or garners a fair share of it.

It helps to understand this "perverse" behavior if, in our minds, we
divide all of the land of a city into two types. The first type, which
can be called general land, is used for general public circulation by
people on foot. It is land over which people move freely, and by choice,
on their way from here to yonder, and from yonder back again. It
includes the streets, many of the smaller parks, and sometimes it
includes the lobbies of buildings when they are used freely as streets.

The second type of land, which can be called special land, is not
commonly used as public thoroughfare by people on foot. It can be built
on or not; it can be publicly owned or not; it can be physically
accessible to people or not. This is beside the point. The point is that
people walk around it, or alongside it, but not through it.

Let us consider this special land, for the moment, as something
[]{#calibre_link-1636 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="263"}that is in
the way, so far as the general public on foot is concerned. It is a
geographic obstacle, either because it is barred to them or because it
contains so little of concern to them.

Looked at in this way, all the special land of a city is an interference
with the use of the general land.

But looked at in another way, this special land contributes greatly to
the use of the general land. It contributes people. Special land
provides whatever people there are to circulate. It provides them either
by housing them at home or at work, or by attracting them to it for
other purposes. If you have no city buildings, you have no use for city
streets.

Both kinds of land thus contribute to circulation. But there is always a
certain tension in their relationship. There is always a pull and a
counterpull between the special land's two roles: as a contributor to
the use of general land on the one hand, and an interference with its
use on the other.

This is a principle long and well understood by downtown merchants, and
as a principle it is easiest to explain in their terms. Wherever a
significant "dead place" appears on a downtown street, it causes a drop
in the intensity of foot circulation there, and in the use of the city
at that point. Sometimes the drop is so serious economically that
business declines to one side or the other of the dead place. Such a
dead place may be an actual vacancy, or it may be a little-used monument
of some sort, or it may be a parking lot, or it may simply be a group of
banks that go dead after three o'clock in the afternoon. Whatever it may
be specifically, the role of the dead place as a geographic obstacle to
the general land has overcome its role as a contributor of users to the
general land. The tension has gone slack.

The general land can absorb and elide most of the effects of
special-land dead spots, especially when these are physically small in
scale. Variations in intensity of the special land's give-and-take with
the general land are needed, because small quiet spots and crescendos of
busy spots are necessary results and aspects of street and district
diversity.

However, the tension between the two kinds of land can go completely
slack, and cannot normally be elided or compensated, if the special land
becomes an immense obstacle. How much does []{#calibre_link-1643
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="264"}it take away from the general
land as a physical obstacle (or as a block to use by choice)? How much
does it give back to the general land in concentration of users? A poor
answer to this equation usually means a vacuum in the general land. The
question is not why intensity of use should be so perverse that it fails
to come up to the nice sharp border. The question, rather, is why we
should expect it to be so perverse as to do so.

::: {#calibre_link-1644 .section_break}

:::

Besides tending to produce these vacuums in the nearby general land (and
hence abnormally poor places for diversity or social vitality to grow),
borders divide up cities into pieces. They set asunder the neighborhoods
of "ordinary" city lying to either side of them. In this respect, they
behave in a fashion opposite from small parks. Small parks, if they are
popular, knit together their neighborhoods from different sides, and
mingle the people from them. Borders also behave in a fashion opposite
from city streets, for these too ordinarily knit together territory and
uses lying to either side, and mingle users. Borders behave in a fashion
opposite from many impressive but smaller-scale uses which otherwise
have something in common with borders. For instance, a railroad station
interacts with its surroundings differently from a railroad track; a
single government building interacts differently with its neighborhood
from the way a large civic center interacts with its neighborhoods.

This sundering, or city-carving, effect of borders is not in itself
always detrimental. If each of the localities separated from one another
by a border is large enough to form a strong city district, with a
sufficiently large and diverse pool of uses and users, the separation
effect is apt to be harmless. Indeed, it can be positively useful, as a
means by which people help orient themselves, help carry a map of the
city in their minds, and understand a district as a place.

The trouble arises when districts (as described back in [Chapter
Six](#calibre_link-15){.calibre7}) are bisected or fragmented by borders
so that the neighborhoods sundered are weak fragments and a district of
subcity size cannot functionally exist. Frequent borders, whether formed
by arterial highways, institutions, projects, campuses, industrial
parks, []{#calibre_link-1648 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="265"}or
any other massive uses of special land, can in this way tear a city to
tatters.

Understanding the drawbacks of borders should help rescue us from
producing unnecessary borders, as we do today, under the misapprehension
that gratuitous border building represents an advanced form of order in
cities.

However, it does not follow that all institutions or other facilities
that cleave cities with borders and tend to ring themselves with vacuums
are to be considered enemies of city life. On the contrary, many of them
are obviously desirable and most important to cities. A big city needs
universities, large medical centers, large parks containing metropolitan
attractions. A city needs railroads; it can use waterfronts for economic
advantage and for amenity; it needs some expressways (especially for
trucking).

The point is hardly to disdain such facilities as these, or to minimize
their value. Rather, the point is to recognize that they are mixed
blessings.

If we can counter their destructive effects, these facilities will
themselves be better served. It is no blessing to most of them, or to
those who use them, to be surrounded by dullness or vacuity, let alone
decay.

::: {#calibre_link-1653 .section_break}
---
:::

The simplest cases to correct, I think, are borders that could logically
encourage much greater use of their perimeters.

Consider, for example, Central Park in New York City. Along the east
side, it has several examples of intensive use (mostly daytime use) at
its perimeter or close inside---the zoo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
the model boat pond. On the west side there is a curious penetration of
the perimeter, especially notable because it operates at night and
because it has been created by users themselves. This is a particular
cross walk into the park which, by common consent, has become the path
for evening and night walking of dogs, hence for other strollers, hence
for anyone who wishes to go into the park and still feel safe.

However, the park's perimeter---especially on its west side---contains
great vacuous stretches, and it exerts a bad vacuum effect along a lot
of border. Meantime, the park is full of objects, deep
[]{#calibre_link-1657 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="266"}inside,
that can be used only during daylight hours, not because of their nature
but because of their location. They are also hard to reach for many of
their putative users. The chess house (which looks like a dreary garage)
is an example. The carousel is another. The guards shepherd people away
from these places, for their own safety, as early as four-thirty on
midwinter afternoons. Moreover, these facilities, aside from their heavy
and ugly architecture, are formidably out of spirit in their deep,
interior park locations. It is quite an achievement to make a splendid
carousel seem lost and gloomy, but this has been achieved in Central
Park.

Park uses like these should be brought right up to the borders of big
parks, and designed as links between the park and its bordering street.
They can belong to the world of the street and, on their other side, to
the world of the park, and be charming in their double life. They should
be calculated, not as rims shutting off a park (that would be terrible)
but as spots of intense and magnetic border activity. Their use by night
should be encouraged. They need not be huge. Three or four chess and
checker pavilions, each with its own architectural character and
setting, disposed at perimeter points around a very large park count,
for this purpose, far more than one chess and checker house four times
as large.

It is up to the other side of the street also---the city side---to
combat park vacuums. We are always hearing suggestions for injecting
dubious uses into large city parks. There is always pressure for
commercialization. Some of these suggestions are puzzling, such as the
question of the gift of a new café for Central Park, which has aroused
much controversy in New York. This is figuratively a border-line case,
and it is also literally a border-line case. Many such semicommercial or
commercial uses belong on the city side of a park border, placed
deliberately to dramatize and intensify cross-use (and
cross-surveillance) to and fro. They ought generally to work in
partnership with border uses on the park side: an example would be a
park skating rink brought *immediately* up to a park border, and across
the street, on the city side, a café where the skaters could get
refreshments and where watchers could observe the skating across the way
from enclosed or open raised terraces. Again there is no reason why both
rink []{#calibre_link-1660 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="267"}and
café could not be used all evening and into the night. Bicycle riding is
fine in a large park; but bicycle renting could be over on the city side
of the line.

The point, in short, would be to seek out border-line cases and invent
new ones too, keeping the city as city and the park as park, but making
the partnership connections between them explicit, lively and
sufficiently frequent.

The principle here has been brilliantly stated, in another connection,
by Kevin Lynch, associate professor of planning at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and the author of *The Image of the City.* "An
edge may be more than simply a dominant barrier," writes Lynch, "if some
visual or motion penetration is allowed through it---if it is, as it
were, structured to some depth with the regions on either side. It then
becomes a seam rather than a barrier, a line of exchange along which two
areas are sewn together."

Lynch was speaking of visual and esthetic problems concerning borders,
and the same principle, exactly, applies to many functional problems
caused by borders.

Universities could make portions, at least, of their campuses more like
seams and less like barriers if they placed their uses intended for the
public at strategic points on their perimeters, and if they also put at
their perimeters, and opened up as scenes, their elements congenial to
public view and interest---instead of hiding them. On a very small
scale, because it is a relatively small institution, the New School for
Social Research in New York has done this with a new building containing
a library. The library is a link between the street and the school's
little "campus," an attractive interior courtyard. Both the library and
the view are visually opened up and dramatized and they are a delight
and an enlivener on their street. Big universities in cities, so far as
I can see, have given no thought or imagination to the unique
establishments they are. Typically they either pretend to be cloistered
or countrified places, nostalgically denying their transplantation, or
else they pretend to be office buildings. (Of course they are neither.)

Waterfronts, too, can be made to act much more like seams than they
ordinarily do today. The usual form of rescue for a decayed waterfront
vacuum is to replace it with a park, which in []{#calibre_link-1666
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="268"}turn becomes a border
element---usually appallingly underused, as might be expected---and this
moves the vacuum effect inland. It is more to the point to grasp the
problem where it originates, at the shoreline, and aim at making the
shore a seam. Waterfront work uses, which are often interesting, should
not be blocked off from ordinary view for interminable stretches, and
the water itself thereby blocked off from city view too at ground level.
Such stretches should be penetrated by small, and even casual, public
openings calculated for glimpsing or watching work and water traffic.
Near where I live is an old open dock, the only one for miles, next to a
huge Department of Sanitation incinerator and scow anchorage. The dock
is used for eel fishing, sunbathing, kite flying, car tinkering,
picnicking, bicycle riding, ice-cream and hot-dog vending, waving at
passing boats, and general kibitzing. (Since it does not belong to the
Parks Department nobody is forbidden anything.) You could not find a
happier place on a hot summer evening or a lazy summer Sunday. From time
to time, a great slushing and clanking fills the air as a sanitation
truck dumps its load into a waiting garbage scow. This is not
pretty-pretty, but it is an event greatly enjoyed on the dock. It
fascinates everybody. Penetrations into working waterfronts need to be
right where the work (loading, unloading, docking) goes on to either
side, rather than segregated where there is nothing much to see.
Boating, boat visiting, fishing, and swimming where it is practicable,
all help make a seam, instead of a barrier, of that troublesome border
between land and water.

::: {#calibre_link-1667 .section_break}
---
:::

It is hopeless to try to convert some borders into seams. Expressways
and their ramps are examples. Moreover, even in the case of large parks,
campuses or waterfronts, the barrier effects can likely be overcome well
only along portions of perimeters.

The only way, I think, to combat vacuums in these cases is to rely on
extraordinarily strong counterforces close by. This means that
population concentration ought to be made deliberately high (and
diverse) near borders, that blocks close to borders should be especially
short and potential street use extremely fluid, and that mixtures of
primary uses should be abundant; so should mixtures in age of buildings.
This may not bring much intensity []{#calibre_link-1670 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="269"}of use right up to the very borders
themselves, but it can help confine the vacuum to a small zone. Near New
York's Central Park, much of Madison Avenue to the east operates thus as
a counterforce to the park's border vacuum. On the west, there is no
such close counterforce. On the south side, the counterforce operates as
far as the sidewalk opposite the park. In Greenwich Village, the
counterforce has the waterfront vacuum in gradual retreat, partly
because the blocks are so very short---160 feet in some cases---that it
is easy for liveliness to take another little jump.

To employ counterforce against *necessary* city borders means this: as
many city elements as possible must be used to build lively, mixed
territory, and as few as possible must be used to compose borders
unnecessarily.

Dwellings, whether subsidized or unsubsidized, major halls, auditoriums,
government buildings, most schools, most city industry, all city
commerce, work congenially in mingled settings, as part and parcel of
the intricate mixed city fabric itself. When such elements are withdrawn
from the mixture and segregated in the form of massive single uses, they
not only result in gratuitous borders but, by being subtracted from
other elements of city mixtures, they leave less material for creating
counterforces.

Planned pedestrian street schemes, *if* they throw formidable borders
for moving and parked cars around inherently weak and fragmentary
preserves, *can introduce more problems than they solve.* Yet this is a
fashionable planning idea for downtown shopping streets and for the
"town centers" of renewal areas. One of the dangers of devising city
traffic schemes and arterial systems without understanding, first, how
cities themselves work, is just this: The schemes, with the best intents
behind them, can inject no end of border vacuums and discontinuities of
use, and in places where these may do the greatest and most gratuitous
harm.

# Unslumming and slumming {#calibre_link-1678 .chaphead1}
:::

Slums and their populations are the victims (and the perpetuators) of
seemingly endless troubles that reinforce each other. Slums operate as
vicious circles. In time, these vicious circles enmesh the whole
operations of cities. Spreading slums require ever greater amounts of
public money---and not simply more money for publicly financed
improvement or to stay even, but more money to cope with ever widening
retreat and regression. As needs grow greater, the wherewithal grows
less.

Our present urban renewal laws are an attempt to break this particular
linkage in the vicious circles by forthrightly wiping away slums and
their populations, and replacing them with projects intended to produce
higher tax yields, or to lure back easier populations with less
expensive public requirements. The method fails. At best, it merely
shifts slums from here to there, adding its own tincture of extra
hardship and disruption. At worst, it destroys neighborhoods where
constructive and improving communities []{#calibre_link-1681 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="271"}exist and where the situation calls for
encouragement rather than destruction.

Like Fight Blight and Conservation campaigns in neighborhoods declining
into slums, slum shifting fails because it tries to overcome causes of
trouble by diddling with symptoms. Sometimes even the very symptoms that
preoccupy the slum shifters are, in the main, vestiges of former
troubles rather than significant indications of current or future ills.

Conventional planning approaches to slums and slum dwellers are
thoroughly paternalistic. The trouble with paternalists is that they
want to make impossibly profound changes, and they choose impossibly
superficial means for doing so. To overcome slums, we must regard slum
dwellers as people capable of understanding and acting upon their own
self-interests, which they certainly are. We need to discern, respect
and build upon the forces for regeneration that exist in slums
themselves, and that demonstrably work in real cities. This is far from
trying to patronize people into a better life, and it is far from what
is done today.

Vicious circles, to be sure, are hard to follow. Cause and effect become
confused precisely because they do link and relink with one another in
such complicated ways.

Yet there is one particular link that is crucial. If it is broken (and
to break it is no simple matter of supplying better housing), a slum
spontaneously unslums.

The key link in a perpetual slum is that too many people move out of it
too fast---and in the meantime dream of getting out. This is the link
that has to be broken if any other efforts at overcoming slums or slum
life are to be of the least avail. This is the link that actually was
broken and has stayed broken in places like the North End, or the
Back-of-the-Yards in Chicago, or North Beach in San Francisco, or the
unslummed former slum in which I live. If only a handful of American
city slums had ever managed to break this link, we might regard it
skeptically as grounds for hope. These places might be freaks. More
significant are the great number of slum neighborhoods in which
unslumming starts, goes unrecognized, and too often is discouraged or
destroyed. The portions of East Harlem in New York which had proceeded
far alonjg in unslumming were first discouraged by []{#calibre_link-1687
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="272"}unavailability of necessary
money; then where this slowed the unslumming process but still did not
bring regression to slum conditions, most of these neighborhoods were
destroyed outright---to be replaced by projects which became almost
pathological displays of slum troubles. Many areas in the Lower East
Side which had started unslumming have been destroyed. My own
neighborhood, as recently as the early 1950's, was saved from disastrous
amputation only because its citizens were able to fight city hall---and
even at that, only because the officials were confronted with
embarrassing evidence that the area was drawing in newcomers with money,
although this symptom of its unslummed status was possibly the least
significant of the constructive changes that had occurred
unnoticed.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-121){#calibre_link-123 .calibre7}

Herbert Gans, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, has
given, in the February 1959 journal of the American Institute of
Planners, a sober but poignant portrait of an unrecognized unslumming
slum, the West End of Boston, on the eve of its destruction. The West
End, he points out, although regarded officially as a "slum," would have
been more accurately described as "a stable, low-rent area." If, writes
Gans, a slum is defined as an area which "because of the nature of its
social environment can be proved to create problems and pathologies,"
then the West End was not a slum. He speaks of the intense attachment of
residents to the district, of its highly developed informal social
control, of the fact that many residents had modernized or improved the
interiors of their apartments---all typical characteristics of an
unslumming slum.

Unslumming hinges, paradoxically, on the retention of a very
considerable part of a slum population within a slum. It hinges on
whether a considerable number of the residents and businessmen of a slum
find it both desirable and practical to make and carry out their own
plans right there, or whether they must virtually all move elsewhere.

I shall use the designation "perpetual slums" to describe slums which
show no signs of social or economic improvement with
[]{#calibre_link-1691 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="273"}time, or
which regress after a little improvement. However, if the conditions for
generating city diversity can be introduced into a neighborhood while it
is a slum, and if any indications of unslumming are encouraged rather
than thwarted, I believe there is no reason that any slum need be
perpetual.

The inability of a perpetual slum to hold enough of its population for
unslumming is a characteristic that starts before the slum itself
starts. There is a fiction that slums, in forming, malignantly supplant
healthy tissue. Nothing could be farther from the truth.

The first sign of an incipient slum, long before visible blight can be
seen, is stagnation and dullness. Dull neighborhoods are inevitably
deserted by their more energetic, ambitious or affluent citizens, and
also by their young people who can get away. They inevitably fail to
draw newcomers by choice. Furthermore, aside from these selective
desertions and the selective lack of vigorous new blood, such
neighborhoods eventually are apt to undergo rather sudden wholesale
desertions by their nonslum populations. The reasons why this is so have
already been stated; there is no need to reiterate the sheer
impracticality of the Great Blight of Dullness for city life.

Nowadays, the wholesale desertions by nonslum populations which give a
slum its initial opportunity to form, are sometimes blamed on the
proximity of another slum (especially if it is a Negro slum) or on the
presence of a few Negro families, much as in the past slum formation was
sometimes blamed on the presence or proximity of Italian or Jewish or
Irish families. Sometimes the desertion is blamed on the age and
obsolescence of dwellings, or on vague, general disadvantages such as
lack of playgrounds or proximity of factories.

However, all such factors are immaterial. In Chicago, you can see
neighborhoods only a block and two blocks in from the lakefront
parkland, far from the settlements of minority groups, well endowed with
greenery, quiet enough to make one's flesh creep, and composed of
substantial, even pretentious, buildings. On these neighborhoods are the
literal signs of desertion: "For Rent," "To Let," "Vacancy," "Rooms for
Permanent and Transient Guests," "Guests Welcome," "Sleeping Rooms,"
"Furnished []{#calibre_link-1697 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="274"}Rooms," "Unfurnished Rooms," "Apartments Available." These
buildings have trouble drawing occupants in a city where the colored
citizens are cruelly overcrowded in their shelter and cruelly
overcharged for it. The buildings are going begging because they are
being rented or sold only to whites---and whites, who have so much more
choice, do not care to live here. The beneficiaries of this particular
impasse, at least for the moment, turn out to be the immigrating
hillbillies, whose economic choice is small and whose familiarity with
city life is still smaller. It is a dubious benefit they receive:
inheritance of dull and dangerous neighborhoods whose unfitness for city
life finally repelled residents more sophisticated and competent than
they.

Sometimes, to be sure, a deliberate conspiracy to turn over the
population of a neighborhood does exist---on the part of real estate
operators who make a racket of buying houses cheaply from panicked white
people and selling them at exorbitant prices to the chronically
housing-starved and pushed-around colored population. But even this
racket works only in already stagnated and low-vitality neighborhoods.
(Sometimes the racket perversely improves a neighborhood's upkeep, when
it brings in colored citizens more competent in general and more
economically able than the whites they replaced; but the exploitative
economics sometimes results instead in replacement of an uncrowded,
apathetic neighborhood with an overcrowded neighborhood in considerable
turmoil.)

If there were no slum dwellers or poor immigrants to inherit city
failures, the problem of low-vitality neighborhoods abandoned by those
with choice would still remain and perhaps would be even more troubling.
This condition can be found in parts of Philadelphia where "decent, safe
and sanitary" dwellings go empty in stagnated neighborhoods, while their
former populations move outward into new neighborhoods which are little
different, intrinsically, from the old except that they are not yet
embedded by the city.

It is easy to see where new slums are spontaneously forming today, and
how dull, dark and undiverse are the streets in which they typically
form, because the process is happening now. What is harder to realize,
because it lies in the past, is the fact that lack []{#calibre_link-1701
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="275"}of lively urbanity has usually
been an original characteristic of slums. The classic reform literature
about slums does not tell us this. Such literature---Lincoln Steffens'
*Autobiography* is a good example---focused on slums that had already
overcome their dull beginnings (but had acquired other troubles in the
meantime). A teeming, bustling slum was pinpointed at a moment in time,
with the deeply erroneous implication that as a slum is, so it was---and
as it is, so it shall be, unless it is wiped away root and branch.

The unslummed former slum in which I live was just such a teeming place
by the early decades of this century, and its gang, the Hudson Dusters,
was notorious throughout the city, but its career as a slum did not
begin in any such bustle. The history of the Episcopal chapel a few
blocks down the street tells the tale of the slum's formation, almost a
century ago in this case. The neighborhood had been a place of farms,
village streets and summer homes which evolved into a semisuburb that
became embedded in the rapidly growing city. Colored people and
immigrants from Europe were surrounding it; neither physically nor
socially was the neighborhood equipped to handle their presence---no
more, apparently, than a semisuburb is so equipped today. Out of this
quiet residential area---a charming place, from the evidence of old
pictures---there were at first many random desertions by congregation
families; those of the congregation who remained eventually panicked and
departed en masse. The church building was abandoned to Trinity parish,
which took it over as a mission chapel to minister to the influx of the
poor who inherited the semisuburb. The former congregation
re-established the church far uptown, and colonized in its neighborhood
a new quiet residential area of unbelievable dullness; it is now a part
of Harlem. The records do not tell where the next preslum was built by
these wanderers.

The reasons for slum formation, and the processes by which it happens,
have changed surprisingly little over the decades. What is new is that
unfit neighborhoods can be deserted more swiftly, and slums can and do
spread thinner and farther, than was the case in the days before
automobiles and government-guaranteed mortgages for suburban
developments, when it was []{#calibre_link-1704 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="276"}less practical for families with choice to
flee neighborhoods that were displaying some of the normal and
inevitable conditions that accompany city life (such as presence of
strangers), but none of the natural means for converting these
conditions into assets.

At the time a slum first forms, its population may rise spectacularly.
This is not a sign of popularity, however. On the contrary, it means the
dwellings are becoming overcrowded; this is happening because people
with the least choice, forced by poverty or discrimination to overcrowd,
are coming into an unpopular area.

The density of the dwelling units themselves may or may not increase. In
old slums, they customarily did increase because of the construction of
tenements. But the rise in dwelling density typically did not cut down
the overcrowding. Total population increased greatly instead, with
overcrowding superimposed on the high dwelling densities.

::: {#calibre_link-1707 .section_break}
---
:::

Once a slum has formed, the pattern of emigration that made it is apt to
continue. Just as in the case of the preslum emigration, two kinds of
movement occur. Successful people, including those who achieve very
modest gains indeed, keep moving out. But there are also apt to be
periodic wholesale migrations, as a whole population begins to achieve
modest gains. Both movements are destructive, the second apparently more
so than the first.

Overcrowding, which is one symptom of the population instability,
continues. It continues, not because the overcrowded people remain, but
because they leave. Too many of those who overcome the economic
necessity to overcrowd get out, instead of improving their lot within
the neighborhood. They are quickly replaced by others who currently have
little economic choice. The buildings, naturally, wear out with
disproportionate swiftness under these conditions.

Residents of a perpetual slum constantly change in this fashion.
Sometimes the change is considered noteworthy because the economic
emigrations and immigrations entail an ethnic change. But the movement
occurs in all perpetual slums, even those that remain ethnically
constant. For instance, a Negro slum in a big []{#calibre_link-1711
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="277"}city, such as central Harlem in
New York, may remain a Negro slum for a long period, but undergo huge,
selective turnovers in population.

The constant departures leave, of course, more than housing vacancies to
be filled. They leave a community in a perpetually embryonic stage, or
perpetually regressing to helpless infancy. The age of buildings is no
index to the age of a community, which is formed by a continuity of
people.

In this sense, a perpetual slum is always going backward instead of
forward, a circumstance that reinforces most of its other troubles. In
some drastic cases of wholesale turnover, it seems that what is getting
a start again is hardly a community but a jungle. This happens when the
new people flooding in have little in common to begin with, and those
who are most ruthless and bitter begin to set what tone there is. Anyone
who does not like that jungle---which is evidently nearly everyone, for
turnover is tremendous in such places---either gets out as fast as he
can or dreams of getting out. Even in such seemingly irreparable
milieus, however, if the population can be held, a slow improvement
starts. I know one such street in New York where this is true, but it is
terribly hard to get sufficient people anchored.

The perpetual slum's progress backward occurs in planned slums, just as
it does in unplanned slums. The main difference is that perpetual
overcrowding is not one of the symptoms in planned slums, because the
number of occupants in dwellings is regulated. Harrison Salisbury, in
his series of articles on delinquency in the *New York Times,* has
described the crucial link of the vicious circle as it operates, in this
case, in low-income projects:

> ...In only too many instances...the slums have been shut up within new
> brick and steel. The horror and deprivation has been immured behind
> those cold new walls. In a well-intended effort to solve one social

> title="278"}end the economic and social levels tend to drop lower and
> lower
>
> A human catch-pool is formed that breeds social ills and requires
> endless outside assistance.

It is the constant hope of the builders of these planned slums that they
will surely improve as "a community has time to form." But time here, as
in an unplanned perpetual slum, is an eternal disrupter instead of a
builder. As might be expected, therefore, the worst examples of the
immured slums, such as Salisbury was describing, are almost invariably
the oldest low-income projects, where the perpetual sliding backward of
the perpetual slum has had longest to operate.

However, an ominous modification in this pattern has started to appear.
With the increase in planned slum shifting, and the rising proportions
of "relocated" people in new projects, these new projects are sometimes
starting off today with the sullenness and discouragement typical of old
projects or of old perpetual unplanned slums---as if they had already,
in their youth, been subjected to the vicissitudes of many disruptions
and disintegrations. This is probably because so many of their residents
have already lived with such experiences, and of course take them along
as emotional baggage. Mrs. Ellen Lurie, of Union Settlement, describing
conditions in a new project, comments:

> One observation can easily be made as a result of all the visits with
> site tenants \[families placed in public housing because their old
> homes were taken for city rebuilding\]. As difficult a job as

> people, angry at the Housing Authority for forcibly uprooting them,
> not fully understanding all the reasons for the move, lonely and
> insecure in a strange new environment---such families must make
> project management all the more overwhelming a task.

Neither slum shifting nor slum immuring breaks that key link in the
perpetuation of slums---the tendency (or necessity) for too many people
to leave too fast. Both these devices merely aggravate and intensify the
processes of perpetual movement backward. Only unslumming overcomes
American city slums, []{#calibre_link-1722 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="279"}or ever has overcome them. If unslumming did not exist, we
would have to invent it. However, since it does exist, and does work,
the point is to help it happen faster and in more places.

::: {#calibre_link-1723 .section_break}

:::

The foundation for unslumming is a slum lively enough to be able to
enjoy city public life and sidewalk safety. The worst foundation is the
dull kind of place that makes slums, instead of unmaking them.

Why slum dwellers should stay in a slum by choice, after it is no longer
economically necessary, has to do with the most personal content of
their lives, in realms which planners and city designers can never
directly reach and manipulate---nor should want to manipulate. The
choice has much to do with the slum dwellers' personal attachments to
other people, with the regard in which they believe they are held in the
neighborhood, and with their sense of values as to what is of greater
and what is of lesser importance in their lives.

Indirectly, however, the wish to stay is obviously influenced by
physical factors in the neighborhood. The treasured "security" of the
home base is, in part, a literal security from physical fear. Slums
where the streets are empty and frightening, and one is unsafe, simply
do not spontaneously unslum. And beyond this, people who do stay in an
unslumming slum, and improve their lot within the neighborhood, often
profess an intense attachment to their street neighborhood. It is a big
part of their life. They seem to think that their neighborhood is unique
and irreplaceable in all the world, and remarkably valuable in spite of
its shortcomings. In this they are correct, for the multitude of
relationships and public characters that make up an animated city street
neighborhood are always unique, intricate and have the value of the
unreproducible original. Unslummed or unslumming neighborhoods are
complex places, very different from the simpler, physically stereotyped
places in which slums typically form.

I do not mean to imply, however, that every slum which gets itself
enough diversity and a sufficiently interesting and convenient life
automatically unslums. Some do not---or what is more usual, they do
start to unslum for a time, the process proves impractical because there
are too many obstacles (mostly financial) []{#calibre_link-1728
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="280"}in the way of the needed changes,
and the place regresses, or is perhaps destroyed.

In any case, where attachment to a slum becomes strong enough to
stimulate unslumming, that attachment begins before the unslumming. If
people are going to stay by choice when they have choice, they must have
become attached before that time. Later is too late.

One of the early symptoms that people are staying by choice is apt to be
a drop in population, accompanied neither by an increase in dwelling
vacancies nor by a decrease in dwelling densities. In short, a given
number of dwellings is being occupied by fewer people. Paradoxically,
this is a signal of popularity. It means that formerly overcrowded
inhabitants who have become economically able to uncrowd are doing so in
their old neighborhood instead of abandoning it to a new wave of the
overcrowded.

To be sure, the population drop also represents people who have
deserted, and this is important too, as we shall see. But the
significant factor to note at this point is that the places of those
leaving are, to a notable degree, being preempted by people who are
staying by choice.

In the neighborhood where I live, which happens to have been an Irish
slum, unslumming was obviously well started as early as 1920, when the
population in our census tract was down to 5,000 from 6,500 in 1910 (the
population peak). In the Depression, population rose a little as
families recrowded, but by 1940 it was down to 2,500 and stayed at about
that in 1950. During this period there were few demolitions in this
census tract, but some rehabilitation; there were few apartment
vacancies at any time; and in the main the population was composed of
those who had been there in the old 1910 days, and of their children and
grandchildren. The drop to less than half of the peak slum population
was, in the main, a measure of the degree of uncrowding that occurred in
a neighborhood with a high dwelling unit density on the residential
land. Indirectly, it also represented an increase in income and choice
characterizing the people who remained.

Similar population drops occurred in all the unslumming
[]{#calibre_link-1734 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="281"}neighborhoods of Greenwich Village. In the once unbelievably
overpacked tenements of the South Village, which was an Italian slum,
population dropped in an illustrative census tract from almost 19,000 in
1910 to about 12,000 in 1920, rose again to almost 15,000 in the
Depression, and then with prosperity dropped and stayed at about 9,500.
As in my neighborhood, this unslumming drop did not represent a
replacement of the old slum population by a new and different
middle-class population. It represented much of the old population
moving into the middle class. In both these illustrative tracts, which I
have chosen as examples of the degree of uncrowding because the number
of dwelling units themselves remained very stable, child population
dropped slightly less, proportionately, than total population; these
were, in the main, families that were
staying.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-122){#calibre_link-124 .calibre7}

The uncrowding that has occurred in the North End of Boston is fully
comparable to that which occurred in the unslumming of Greenwich
Village.

To know whether uncrowding has occurred, or is occurring, and whether a
drop in population is a sign of the popularity of the neighborhood with
those who know it best, one must know whether or not the drop is
accompanied by appreciable dwelling vacancies. For instance, in some
parts of the Lower East Side (by no means all), population drops during
the 1930's were only in part from uncrowding. They represented also
large numbers of vacancies. When these vacancies filled up again, they
filled with an overcrowded population, as might be expected. They had
been abandoned by those with choice.

::: {#calibre_link-1737 .section_break}
---
:::

When sufficient people begin to stay in a slum by choice, several other
important things also begin to happen.

The community itself gains competence and strength, partly from practice
and growth of trust, and finally (this takes much []{#calibre_link-1740
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="282"}longer) from becoming less
provincial. These matters were gone into in [Chapter
Six](#calibre_link-15){.calibre7}, the discussion of neighborhoods.

At this point I would like to emphasize a third change that occurs---and
that is implied in the eventual decrease of provincialism. This change
is a gradual self-diversification within the population itself. The
degree of financial and educational advancement among those who remain
in an unslumming slum varies. The majority make modest gains, some make
considerable gains, and some make virtually no gains at all. The
different skills, interests, activities and acquaintanceships outside
the neighborhood vary and diverge with time.

City officials today prate about "bringing back the middle class," as if
nobody were in the middle class until he had left the city and acquired
a ranch house and a barbecue and thereby become precious. To be sure,
cities are losing their middle class populations. However, cities need
not "bring back" a middle class, and carefully protect it like an
artificial growth. Cities grow the middle class. But to keep it as it
grows, to keep it as a stabilizing force in the form of a
self-diversified population, means considering the city's people
valuable and worth retaining, right where they are, before they become
middle class.

Even those who remain poorest in an unslumming slum are gainers from the
process of unslumming---and therefore they make the city a gainer too.
In our neighborhood, these most unlucky or least ambitious of the
original slum population, who might otherwise be permanent slum
dwellers, have happily escaped that fate. Furthermore, although these
people at the bottom are hardly successes by most standards, in their
street neighborhoods most of them are successes. They make up a vital
part of the web of casual public life. The amount of time they devote to
street watching and street management makes some of the rest of us
parasites upon them.

Into an unslumming or unslummed slum customarily come new increments of
poor or ignorant immigrants from time to time. The Boston banker whom I
quoted in the introduction to this book derided the North End because
"it is still getting some immigrants." So is our neighborhood. This too
is one of the []{#calibre_link-1745 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="283"}great services of unslumming. People are accommodated and
assimilated, not in undigestible floods, but as gradual additions, in
neighborhoods capable of accepting and handling strangers in a civilized
fashion. The immigrants---ours happen to be mostly Puerto Ricans and
they are going to make a fine middle class which the city cannot afford
to lose---do not escape most of the problems of being immigrants, but at
least they do escape the ordeal and demoralization of the perpetual
slum. They quickly assimilate into the public street life, and are
lively and competent at holding up their end. These very same people
could hardly act as they do within the community, nor would they be
likely to stay put as long, were they part of a tumultuous replacement
throng in a perpetual slum.

Other gainers from unslumming are newcomers who have choice. They can
find in the city a place to live which is fit for city life.

Both kinds of newcomers add to the population diversification of an
unslumming or unslummed neighborhood. But the indispensable foundation
for this added population diversity is the self-diversification and
stability of the former slum population itself.

At the beginning of the process of unslumming, few if any of the slum's
most outstandingly successful residents---or their most successful and
ambitious children---are apt to stay. Unslumming begins with those who
make modest gains, and with those to whom personal attachments
overshadow their individual achievement. Later, with improvement, the
threshold of success or ambition among those who stay may rise
appreciably.

The losses of the most successful or most daring are, in a peculiar
fashion, also necessary to the unslumming, I think. For some of those
who leave are overcoming one of the terrible problems of most slum
populations---the onus of discrimination.

The discrimination which operates most drastically today is, of course,
discrimination against Negroes. But it is an injustice with which all
our major slum populations have had to contend to some degree.

A ghetto, by the very fact that it is a ghetto, is a place in which most
people of spirit, especially the young who have not
[]{#calibre_link-1752 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="284"}learned
resignation, will not stay entirely willingly. This is true no matter
how objectively good their physical accommodations and social
surroundings may otherwise be. They may have to stay. They may diversify
within the ghetto considerably. But this is far from the same as
acceptance and glad attachment. It is fortunate, in my opinion, that so
many of our ghetto dwellers do not feel resigned or defeatist; we would
have far more to worry about as a society if we could easily get away
with our tendencies toward master-race psychology. But be that as it
may, the fact is that in our ghettos live people of spirit, and they
don't like ghettos.

When discrimination is appreciably broken down outside a ghetto by its
more successful progeny, then the old neighborhood has a great burden
lifted from it. Then it is no longer, necessarily, a mark of inferiority
to stay there. It can be a mark of genuine choice. In the North End, as
an example of what I mean, a young butcher explained carefully to me
that it no longer "downgraded" a person to live there. To illustrate his
point, he took me to the door of his shop, pointed out a three-story row
house down the block, told me that the family who lived there just spent
\$20,000 modernizing it (out of saved earnings!), and added, "That man
could live anywhere. Today, he could move into a high-class suburb if he
wanted to. He wants to stay here. People who stay here don't have to,
you know. They like it."

The effective breaking down of residential discrimination outside a
slum, and the less dramatic self-diversification within an unslumming
slum, proceed concurrently. If America has now, in the case of Negroes,
reached an effective halt in this process and in general entered a stage
of arrested development---a thought I find both highly improbable and
quite intolerable---then it may be that Negro slums cannot effectively
unslum in the fashion demonstrated by slums formed by other ethnic
populations and population mixtures. In this case, the damage to our
cities might be the least of our worries; unslumming is a by-product of
other kinds of vigor and other forms of economic and social change.

When an area has unslummed, it is easy to forget how bad it once was and
how helpless both the area and its population []{#calibre_link-1756
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="285"}were thought to be. This supposed
utter worthlessness of the neighborhood was once the case of the area
where I live. I see no reason to believe that Negro slums cannot unslum
too, and more swiftly than the old slums at that, if the processes at
work are understood and helped. As in the case of other slums,
overcoming of discrimination outside the slum, and unslumming within the
slum, must proceed concurrently. Neither can wait for the accomplishment
of the other. Every relaxation of discrimination outside can help
unslumming within. Progress in unslumming within helps outside. The two
go together.

The inherent resources necessary for unslumming---advancement and
self-diversification in a population---demonstrably exist among colored
people, including the colored people who are in slums or who have passed
through slums, as strikingly as these resources exist among white
people. In a way the proved and obvious possession of these resources is
more striking among the colored, because they emerge in spite of
disproportionate obstacles against their emergence. Indeed, because of
the very facts that colored populations advance, self-diversify and have
too much spirit to like ghettos, our inner cities have already lost far
more of the Negro middle class than they can afford to lose.

I think inner cities will go on losing too much of the Negro middle
class almost as fast as it forms until, in actual fact, the choice of
remaining there no longer means, for a colored person, an implied
acceptance of ghetto citizenship and status. In short, unslumming is at
the very least directly---as well as indirectly---inhibited by
discrimination. Here I want to remind readers, without repeating it, of
a point made near the beginning of this book, on pages 71 and 72,
drawing a connection between an urban quality of street use and street
life, and the feasibility of overcoming residential discrimination.

Although we Americans talk much about the rapidity with which we accept
change, this does not apply to rapidity of intellectual change, I am
afraid. Generation after generation, nonslum dwellers stick to the same
foolish ideas about slums and slum dwellers. The pessimists always seem
to feel that there is something inferior about the current crops of slum
dwellers themselves, []{#calibre_link-1760 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="286"}and can point out supposedly dire differences that
distinguish them from previous immigrants. The optimists always seem to
feel that there is nothing wrong with slums that could not be fixed by
housing and land-use reform and enough social workers. It is hard to say
which oversimplification is the sillier.

::: {#calibre_link-1761 .section_break}

:::

Self-diversification of a population is reflected in diversification of
commercial and cultural enterprises. Diversification of income alone
makes a difference in the range of possible commercial diversification,
often in the humblest ways. Consider, as an illustrative example, the
case of a New York cobbler who hung on while most of the adjoining
neighborhood was cleared of its population and a new low-income project
constructed. After his long and hopeful wait for his new customers, he
is going out of business at this location. As he explains it, "I used to
get good strong working boots to do, good shoes worth working on. But
those new people, even the working men, are *all* so poor. Their shoes
are so cheap and flimsy they fall to pieces. They bring them in---look.
Shoes like this can't be repaired. What can I do to them---remake them?
Even so, they can't pay for the work. There's no use for me here." The
old neighborhood would have been characterized as predominately poor
too, but it had people who had made modest gains. It was not a sorting
of all the poorest.

In unslumming slums where great population drops have occurred with
uncrowding, this event has been accompanied by a directly related
increase in diversity of incomes---and sometimes by a considerable
increase in visitors and cross-use from other neighborhoods and other
districts. Under these conditions, tremendous drops in population (which
of course occurred gradually rather than as a cataclysm) have not
resulted in commercial decimation. On the contrary, the range and
prosperity of enterprises typically increases in unslumming slums.

With the *uniformly* very poor, it takes very concentrated densities to
produce a genuine exuberance and interesting range of diversity, as some
of our old slums did by dint of fantastic overcrowding superimposed on
top of very high dwelling densities---combined, of course, with the
other three basic conditions for generating diversity.

[]{#calibre_link-1766 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="287"}Successful
unslumming means that enough people must have an attachment to the slum
that they wish to stay, and it also means that it must be practical for
them to stay. Impracticality is the rock on which many an unslumming
slum is wrecked. Impracticality has mostly to do with unavailability of
money for improvements, for new buildings, and for commercial
enterprises at a time when these needs become urgent and their
discouragement crucial. Impracticality has to do with the difficulty of
making, with time, many changes in detail in the unslumming slum. I
shall deal with this problem in the course of the next two chapters.

Aside from these more subtle (but powerful) discouragements, unslumming
today is frequently halted by the ultimate discouragement-destruction.

The very fact that a slum has uncrowded itself makes it an extremely
tempting site for whole or partial urban "renewal" clearance. The
relocation problem looks so simple in comparison with that of
horrendously overcrowded perpetual slums. Also the area's comparative
social health makes it tempting to clear for a higher-income population.
It seems a feasible place for "bringing back the middle class." Unlike a
perpetual slum, it is "ripe for redevelopment," as if some mysterious
virtue of civilization resided in the very ground here and would be
transferred. Describing the destruction of the lively, stable, low-rent
West End in Boston, Gans made an observation which applies also to other
big cities engaged in redevelopment: "Meanwhile, other areas which have
older, more deteriorated and even harmful housing have a lower priority
for renewal, because of the lack of interest among potential developers
or other powerful interests."

Nothing in the training of planners, architects or government officials
contradicts these temptations to destroy unslumming slums. On the
contrary, everything that makes these men experts reinforces the
temptation; for a slum which has been successfully unslumming
displays---inevitably---features of layout, use, ground coverage,
mixture and activities that are diametrically opposed to the ideals of
Radiant Garden City. Otherwise it would never have been able to unslum.

An unslumming slum is peculiarly vulnerable in still another
[]{#calibre_link-1771 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="288"}respect.
Nobody is making a fortune out of it. The two great moneymakers in
cities are, on the one hand, unsuccessful, perpetual slums and, on the
other hand, high-rent or high-cost areas. An unslumming neighborhood is
no longer paying off excessively, as it may once have paid, to
exploiting slum landlords who do best with greenhorns, nor is it so lush
or concentrated a field for policy, drug, vice or protection rackets as
is a perpetual slum. On the other hand, neither is it rendering the
premium land and building prices associated with the self-destruction of
diversity. It is just providing a decent, animated place to live for
people who are predominately of modest circumstances, and providing an
unspectacular livelihood to the owners of many small enterprises.

Thus the only people who object to destruction of an unslumming
neighborhood---especially if it has not yet begun drawing newcomers with
choice---are those who have businesses there or who live there. If they
try to explain to the uncomprehending experts that this is a good place
and growing better, nobody pays attention. In every city, such protests
are discounted as the howls of people of narrow vision standing in the
way of progress and higher tax receipts.

The processes that occur in unslumming depend on the fact that a
metropolitan economy, if it is working well, is constantly transforming
many poor people into middle-class people, many illiterates into skilled
(or even educated) people, many greenhorns into competent citizens.

In Boston, the improvement of the North End was explained to me by
several people outside the district as a peculiar, a freakish thing,
based on the circumstance that "North Enders are Sicilians." When I was
a girl, people from Sicily and their descendants were slum dwellers, so
it was believed, because they were Sicilians. The unslumming and
self-diversification within the North End has nothing to do with Sicily.
It has to do with the vigor of metropolitan economies, and with the
choices and opportunities (some good, some bad) that these energetic
economies produce.

This energy and its effects---so different from immemorial peasant
life---are so obvious in great cities, and so much taken for
[]{#calibre_link-1777 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="289"}granted,
that it is curious that our planning fails to incorporate them as a
major and salient reality. It is curious that city planning neither
respects spontaneous self-diversification among city populations nor
contrives to provide for it. It is curious that city designers seem
neither to recognize this force of self-diversification nor to be
attracted by the esthetic problems of expressing it.

These odd intellectual omissions go back, I think, to the Garden City
nonsense, as so many of the unspoken presuppositions of city planning
and city design do. Ebenezer Howard's vision of the Garden City would
seem almost feudal to us. He seems to have thought that members of the
industrial working classes would stay neatly in their class, and even at
the same job within their class; that agricultural workers would stay in
agriculture; that businessmen (the enemy) would hardly exist as a
significant force in his Utopia; and that planners could go about their
good and lofty work, unhampered by rude nay-saying from the untrained.

It was the very fluidity of the new nineteeth-century industrial and
metropolitan society, with its profound shiftings of power, people and
money, that agitated Howard so deeply---and his more dedicated followers
(like the American Decentrists and Regional Planners) after him. Howard
wanted to freeze power, people, and the uses and increments of money
into an easily manageable and static pattern. Indeed, he happened to
want a pattern that was already obsolete. "How to stem the drift from
the country is one of the main problems of the day," said he. "The
laborer may perhaps be restored to the land, but how will the country
industries be restored to rural England?"

Howard aimed at outfoxing the bewildering new city merchants and other
entrepreneurs who seemed to spring up inexhaustibly from nowhere. How to
leave them no scope in which to pursue their operations, except under
the tight directives of a monopolistic corporate plan---this was one of
Howard's chief preoccupations in devising his Garden Cities. Howard
feared and rejected the energetic forces inherent in urbanization
combined with industrialization. He permitted them no part in overcoming
slum life.

The restoration of a static society, ruled---in everything that
[]{#calibre_link-1782 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="290"}mattered---by a new aristocracy of altruistic planning
experts, may seem a vision remote from modern American slum clearing,
slum shifting and slum immuring. But the planning derived from these
semifeudal objectives has never been reassessed. It has been employed to
deal with real, twentieth-century cities. And this is one reason why,
when American city slums do unslum, they do so in spite of planning and
counter to the ideals of city planning.

For the sake of its own internal consistency, conventional planning
embodies a fantasy about the bewildering presence of people in "slums"
whose incomes do not conform to slum dwellers' incomes. Such people are
characterized as victims of inertia, who need a push. (The comments of
those who are unctuously given this information about themselves are
unprintable.) Clearance, even though they protest it, does them a favor,
according to this fantasy, by forcing them to better themselves.
Bettering themselves means finding their squadron of price-tagged
population and marching with it.

Unslumming and its accompanying self-diversification---possibly the
greatest regenerative forces inherent in energetic American metropolitan
economies---thus appear, in the murky light of conventional planning and
rebuilding wisdom, to represent mere social untidiness and economic
confusion, and they are so treated.

# Gradual money and cataclysmic money {#calibre_link-1790 .chaphead1}
:::

Thus far, I have been writing almost entirely about the qualities that
work for *inherent* success in cities. To make an analogy, it is as if I
had been discussing farming almost entirely in terms of soil, water,
machinery, seed and fertilizer requirements for good crops, but said
nothing about the financial means of getting those things.

To understand why the financial means and methods used for buying the
agricultural necessities mattered greatly, we would first have to
understand why the crop-growing requirements themselves mattered
greatly, and something about their own nature. Without that
understanding, we might ignore the problem of how to finance a reliable
water supply and enthusiastically tie ourselves up instead with methods
to finance ever more elaborate fencing. Or, knowing that water was
somehow important, but understanding little about its possible sources
for our purposes, []{#calibre_link-1793 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="292"}we might spend our substance on rain dances and have no
financial arrangements to buy pipes.

Money has its limitations. It cannot buy inherent success for cities
where the conditions for inherent success are lacking and where the use
of the money fails to supply them. Furthermore, money can only do
ultimate harm where it destroys the conditions needed for inherent
success. On the other hand, by helping to supply the requirements
needed, money can help build inherent success in cities. Indeed, it is
indispensable.

For these reasons, money is a powerful force both for city decline and
for city regeneration. But it must be understood that it is not the mere
availability of money, but how it is available, and for what, that is
all important.

Three principal kinds of money finance and shape most of the changes
that occur in residential and business properties in cities. Because
this money is so powerful an *instrument*---as it goes, so go our
cities.

The first, and most important, of the three kinds of money is the credit
extended by conventional, nongovernmental lending institutions. In order
of size of their mortgage holdings, the most important of these
institutions are: savings and loan associations, life insurance
companies, commercial banks and mutual savings banks. Added to these are
various categories of minor mortgage lenders---some of them growing
rapidly, such as pension funds. By far the lion's share of building,
remodeling, rehabilitation, replacement and expansion that occurs in
cities (as well as in the suburbs beyond cities) is financed by this
kind of money.

The second kind of money is that provided by government, either out of
tax receipts or through governmental borrowing power. Aside from the
city building which is traditionally governmental (schools, highways,
etc.), residential and business properties are also financed in some
cases by this money. Still more are shaped and influenced by the fact
that it can be drawn on for partial financing, or for insurance of other
loans. Land-clearance subsidies from the federal and city governments to
make privately financed redevelopment and renewal projects financially
feasible, are among the uses of this money; so are housing projects
underwritten by federal, state or city governments. In addition, the
[]{#calibre_link-1799 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="293"}federal
government will guarantee as much as 90 percent of the value of
residential mortgages financed by conventional lenders---and will even
buy up guaranteed mortgages from lenders------provided that the
developments whose mortgages have thus been guaranteed conform to
standards of planning approved by the Federal Housing Administration.

The third kind of money comes from a shadow world of investment, an
underworld of cash and credit, so to speak. Where this money comes from
ultimately, and by what avenues it finds its way, is concealed and
devious. This money is lent at interest rates starting at about 20
percent and ranging as high as the market will bear, apparently in some
cases up to 80 percent in combinations of interest rates and arrangers'
fees and cuts. It does many jobs---a few of which are actually
constructive and useful---but it is most notable for financing
exploitative conversions of humdrum buildings to slum buildings at
exorbitant profits. This money is to the mortgage market what loan-shark
money is to personal finance.

All three of these kinds of money behave differently in important
respects. Each does its part in financing city property changes.

With full awareness of their differences---and especially the moral
difference between the shadow-world money and the legitimate private and
governmental money---I plan to point out that the behavior of these
three kinds of money is similar in one respect. In sum, this money
shapes cataclysmic changes in cities. Relatively little of it shapes
gradual change.

Cataclysmic money pours into an area in concentrated form, producing
drastic changes. As an obverse of this behavior, cataclysmic money sends
relatively few trickles into localities not treated to cataclysm.

Putting it figuratively, insofar as their effects on most city streets
and districts are concerned, these three kinds of money behave not like
irrigation systems, bringing life-giving streams to feed steady,
continual growth. Instead, they behave like manifestations of malevolent
climates beyond the control of man---affording either searing droughts
or torrential, eroding floods.

This is, of course, no constructive way to nurture cities. City building
that has a solid footing produces continual and gradual
[]{#calibre_link-1806 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="294"}change,
building complex diversifications. Growth of diversity itself is created
by means of changes dependent upon each other to build increasingly
effective combinations of uses. Unslumming---much as it should be
speeded up from the glacial pace at which it now proceeds---is a process
of steady but gradual change. All city building that retains staying
power after its novelty has gone, and that preserves the freedom of the
streets and upholds citizens' self-management, requires that its
locality be able to adapt, keep up to date, keep interesting, keep
convenient, and this in turn requires a myriad of gradual, constant,
close-grained changes.

To bring city streets and districts up to good operating condition
(which means, mainly, supplying the conditions to generate diversity),
and to keep them there, is a job that cannot be begun too soon. But on
the other hand, it is also a job that is never over and done with, and
never will be, in any given place.

The kind of money necessary for capitalizing upon, building upon and
supplementing what exists is gradual money. But this indispensable
instrument is lacking.

This is far from an inevitable situation. On the contrary, it has taken
considerable well-intended ingenuity (along with a certain amount of
drifting) to bring us to this pass. The "inevitable," as Holmes said,
comes about only through great effort; this is so with respect to the
cataclysmic use of money in cities. As one obvious indication of this,
if all the pep talks and brochures urging investment in sweeping renewal
cataclysms were bound together, they would make a volume at least fifty
times the size of this book. And yet, notwithstanding all this
promotion, and the immense data-collecting and legislative work behind
it, so cumbersome is this form of city investment that it serves better,
in many instances, to paralyze and to penalize the use of money rather
than to stimulate and to reward it. Ever greater incentives must
constantly be contrived to give investment in this type of cataclysm
another shot and another shove. As Arthur H. Motley, president of the U.
S. Chamber of Commerce, commented at a renewal conference late in 1960,
"Some cities using federal funds have acquired so much land without
rebuilding that the Federal []{#calibre_link-1810 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="295"}Housing and Home Finance Agency has become
the largest grower of ragweed."

Motley's bleak realism was not in the spirit of such conferences, which
run mainly to platitudes about the "challenge," and "the businessman's
stake in healthy and beautiful cities," and to such sage remarks as "The
key to future investment in this field is the profit factor."

Behind the use of mortgage and building money is, to be sure, concern
about the profit factor---in most cases legitimate concern about
legitimate profits. But in addition, behind the use of this money stand
more abstract ideas about cities themselves, and these ideas are mighty
determinants of what is done with money in cities. No more than park
designers or zoners do mortgage lenders operate in an ideological or
legislative vacuum.

Let us begin with the existence and the effects of money droughts, for
droughts of mortgage money are the cause of much otherwise unnecessary
city decline.

"If the power to tax is the power to destroy...then the credit authority
is not only the power to destroy but the power to create and the power
to divert," says Professor Charles M. Haar of the Harvard Law School in
an analysis of federal incentives for home-building investment.

The power to destroy which is possessed by authority over credit or by
management of credit is negative: it is the power to withhold credit.

To understand the effects of this action on city neighborhoods we can
best begin by looking into a couple of miracles---for the purpose of
understanding that it does take miracles to overcome this force for
decline.

The North End of Boston represents escape by miracle.

Following the Great Depression and then the war, periods in which
virtually no building was done in any case, the North End was
blacklisted by conventional lending institutions as a locality for
mortgage loans. This meant that the North End was cut off from building,
expansion or rehabilitation credit from the American
[]{#calibre_link-1820 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="296"}lending
*systems* almost as effectively as if it were a community in Tasmania.

For thirty years, beginning with the Depression and moving on into the
period of Blacklist, the largest conventional mortgage loans made in
this district were for \$3,000, and these have been rare. The most
affluent suburb, one would surmise, could hardly have held up over such
a period under such terms. Material improvement would be miraculous.

Owing to a peculiarly fortunate circumstance, the North End did manage
such a miracle. Among its residents and businessmen and their relatives
and friends, it happens that there are many persons engaged in the
building trades: masons, electricians, carpenters, contractors. These
people have contributed their services in some cases and bartered them
in others to modernize and rehabilitate North End buildings. Costs have
been mainly costs of materials, and it has been possible to finance
these pay-as-you-go, out of savings. In the North End, a businessman or
landlord has to have the money *first,* to finance improvements which he
anticipates will justify the expenditure by returning it.

In short, the North End reverted to primitive methods of barter and
hoard that worked before there were banking systems. To do so was a
given condition for continued unslumming and for community survival.

These methods, however, cannot be stretched to cover the financing of
the new construction which should be introduced into the North End, as
into any living city neighborhood, gradually.

The North End, as things stand, can get new construction only by
submitting to a cataclysm of renewal and redevelopment---a cataclysm
which would destroy its complexity, disperse its people and wipe out its
businessmen.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-125){#calibre_link-129 .calibre7} It
would also cost an immense amount of money in comparison with the North
End's needs for []{#calibre_link-1826 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="297"}money to finance steady, continual improvement and
replacement of what wears out.

The Back-of-the-Yards in Chicago survived and improved after its death
warrant had seemingly been sealed; it did so with a different kind of
extraordinary resource. So far as I know, the Back-of-the-Yards is the
only city district which has met the common problem of credit
blacklisting head on and overcome it by direct means. To understand how
it was able to do so, it is necessary to understand a little of the
history of this district.

The Back-of-the-Yards used to be a notorious slum. When the great
muckraker and crusader, Upton Sinclair, wanted to describe the dregs of
city life and human exploitation in his book, *The Jungle*, it was the
Back-of-the-Yards and its associated stockyards he chose to portray.
People from there who sought jobs outside the district gave false
addresses, as late as the 1930's, to avoid the discrimination that then
attached to residence there. Physically, as recently as 1953, the
district, a hodgepodge of weather-beaten buildings, was a classic
example of the sort of locality which it is conventionally believed must
be bulldozed away entire.

In the 1930's the breadwinners of the district worked principally in the
stockyards, and during that decade the district and its people became
deeply involved in unionizing the packing plants. Building upon the new
militancy, and resolving to seize the opportunity it offered for
submerging old nationality antagonisms that had previously set the
district asunder, a number of very able men started an experiment in
local organization.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-126){#calibre_link-130
.calibre7} Called the Back-of-the-Yards Council, the organization
adopted the brave slogan, "We, the people, will work out our own
destiny." The Council has come to operate much as a government does. It
possesses a more inclusive and formal organization than the usual
citizens' association, and much greater power, both for carrying out
public services of its own and for exerting its will
[]{#calibre_link-1830 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="298"}on the
municipal government. Policies are set by a kind of legislature of two
hundred elected representatives from smaller organizations and street
neighborhoods. The district's power to get from city hall the municipal
services, facilities, regulations, and exceptions to regulations it
needs is regarded with considerable awe throughout Chicago. In short,
the Back-of-the-Yards is no portion of the body politic to take on
lightly or unthinkingly in a fight, which is a point of major
significance to this story.

In the interval between the formation of the Council and the early
1950's, the people of the district and their children made other kinds
of advancement. Many graduated into skilled industrial, white-collar or
professional jobs. The "inevitable" next move at this stage should have
been a mass emigration to income-sorting suburbs, with a new wave of
people possessing little choice sweeping into the abandoned district.
Backward, the perpetual slum.

Like people generally in unslumming city neighborhoods, however, the
people of this district wanted to stay. (That is why they had already
been uncrowding and unslumming within their neighborhoods.) The existing
institutions, especially the churches, wanted them to stay.

At the same time, however, thousands of residents also wanted to improve
their dwellings beyond the uncrowding and the small amount of
refurbishing or refurnishing already accomplished. They were no longer
slum dwellers and they did not wish to live as if they were.

The two desires---to stay and to improve---were incompatible because
nobody could get a loan for an improvement. Like the North End, the
Back-of-the-Yards was blacklisted for mortgage credit.

But in this case an organization capable of dealing with the problem
existed. A survey by the Council turned up the information that
businesses, residents and institutions within the district had deposits
in some thirty of Chicago's savings and loan associations and savings
banks. Within the district, it was agreed that these
depositors---institutions and businesses as well as individuals---would
be prepared to withdraw their deposits if lending institutions continued
to blacklist the district.

[]{#calibre_link-1837 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="299"}On July 2,
1953, representatives of the banks and the savings and loan associations
turned up by the Council's survey were invited to a meeting. The
mortgage problem of the district was presented and discussed amiably.
Comments were dropped by Council spokesmen, politely, about the numbers
of depositors in the district...the extent of their deposits...the
difficulty of understanding why investment of savings by city dwellers
seemed so little available for use in cities...the solid concern about
the problem within the district...the value of public understanding.

Before the meeting was over, several of the lenders pledged their
help---that is, favorable consideration of requests for loans. The same
day, the Council began negotiating for a site for forty-nine new
dwellings. Soon afterward, the most squalid row of slum apartments was
equipped with indoor plumbing and otherwise modernized, by means of a
\$90,000 loan. Within three years, some five thousand houses had been
rehabilitated by their owners, and the number rehabilitated since has
been so great it has not been kept track of. In 1959, construction of
several small apartment houses was begun. The Council, and people within
the district, refer to the banks' interest and cooperation in their
improvement with gratitude. And the banks, in their turn, speak
admiringly of the area as a location for sound investment. Nobody was
thrown out of the district and "relocated." No businesses were
destroyed. Unslumming, in short, has proceeded, even though the process
reached a point---as it eventually does everywhere---when the need for
credit becomes crucial.

::: {#calibre_link-1839 .section_break}

:::

Credit blacklisting of city localities is impersonal. It operates not
against the residents or businessmen, as persons, but against their
neighborhoods. For example, a merchant with whom I am acquainted in the
blacklisted district of East Harlem in New York, unable to get a
\$15,000 loan for expanding and modernizing his successful business
there, had no difficulty raising \$30,000 to build a house on Long
Island. Similarly, a person in the North End, purely by being alive, and
by holding a job as a bricklayer or a bookkeeper or a boltmaker, can
easily borrow thirty years' worth of money, at the going rate, for the
purpose of buying a []{#calibre_link-1841 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="300"}house in a suburban development. But attached to the North
End, neither he, nor his neighbors, nor their landlords, are worth a
penny's credit.

This is outrageous and destructive, but before becoming outraged, it is
well to pause and consider that the banks and other conventional lenders
who blacklist city localities have done no more than take seriously the
conventional lessons of city planning. They are not villainous.
Credit-blacklist maps are identical, both in conception and in most
results, with municipal slum-clearance maps. And municipal
slum-clearance maps are regarded as responsible devices, used for
responsible purposes---among their purposes is, in fact, that of warning
lenders not to invest here.

Sometimes the planners anticipate the lenders; sometimes the lenders
anticipate the planners; both of them know what they are doing because
they have both learned so much about Radiant Garden City Beautiful
planning. The two devices---blacklist maps and slum-clearance
maps---came into common use at about the same time, in the early 1940's.
With the lenders, they first started as maps of areas in which there had
been large numbers of foreclosures during the Great Depression, and
which hence were presumably poor risks for future loans. This criterion,
however, receded into the background. (It was confusing. The Grand
Central office area in New York had one of the worst foreclosure records
in the country; did this mean it was a poor risk for future investment?)
The modern criterion is the lenders' decision that such-and-such a place
is already a slum, or else is destined to become a slum. Its future,
insofar as it is considered, is thus conceived in terms of orthodox city
planning remedies: eventual erasure, and in the meantime, decline.

In choosing to use the power of credit to destroy, lenders operate on
the premise, therefore, that their actions register an inevitability
and, in the light of that inevitability, no more than prudence. They are
making prophecies.

Usually their prophecies are borne out, too. Consider, for example, the
case of a New England city (not Boston this time) with an extensive and
well-publicized redevelopment program. As a foundation for its work, the
redevelopment staff prepared a map that showed where decay had proceeded
so far that clearance []{#calibre_link-1846 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="301"}was deemed necessary. After the map was made, the planners
discovered that it coincided, exactly, with the maps prepared by the
city's bankers many years previously, designating localities into which
no loans would be made. The bankers had prophesied these places would
become hopeless slums, and their prognoses were accurate. Only one minor
discrepancy showed between the two maps. This was a case in which the
planners' map prescribed not complete clearance, but instead spot
clearance. In this one instance, a blacklisted locality, including parts
of its small business district, had not seemed too far gone for limited
conservation. This locality alone had its independent source of credit:
a small, family-run bank, a vestige of earlier days, an oddity that did
make loans within its blacklisted area. Such business expansion and
refurbishing, such upkeep as the locality had, was financed by it. This,
for instance, was the source of credit that had enabled the
neighborhood's outstanding commercial establishment---a restaurant
drawing customers from all over the city---to acquire good equipment and
to expand and refurbish as needed.

Credit-blacklisting maps, like slum-clearance maps, are accurate
prophecies because they are self-fulfilling prophecies.

In the cases of the North End and the Back-of-the-Yards, the blacklist
maps were inaccurate prophecies. But no one would ever know they had
been inaccurate estimates of the potentiality, were it not for the
miraculous ability of these places to evade their sentences.

Other city neighborhoods of vitality often show resistance to the death
sentence. My own neighborhood did for twelve years (this was a case in
which the planners led the way with a slum-clearance map and the lenders
followed). A few streets of East Harlem have stood up under blacklisting
since 1942, by means of loans made back and forth among families and
relatives.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-127){#calibre_link-131 .calibre7}

[]{#calibre_link-1851 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="302"}There is no
telling how many city districts have been destroyed by blacklisting. The
Lower East Side of New York, an area of great potential---at least as
great a potential as Greenwich Village---was doomed by blacklisting. The
Society Hill district in Philadelphia, on which great sums of public
renewal money are now to be spent to "bring back the middle class"
officially, was chosen by many middle-income people on their own
initiative in years past---only to be unchosen when they could not get
loans to buy or to rehabilitate there.

Unless a neighborhood does possess extraordinary vitality, along with
some form of extraordinary resource, a drought of conventional money
inexorably enforces deterioration.

The worst cases are neighborhoods that are already stagnant, with much
that is inherently wrong. These localities, which are losing their
former residents anyway, often undergo a special form of investment
cataclysm. Within a short interval after they are blacklisted for
conventional credit, there may come into the vacuum money from the
shadow world of investment. It pours in, buying up property for which
there are no other purchasers now, and presumably will not be, and to
which their current owners or users have no great, effective attachment.
Quick conversions of buildings to the most exploitative slums follow.
Shadow-world cataclysmic money is filling in the gap left by
conventional money.

This sequence occurs in most great cities, and seems to be taken for
granted, although few studies have been made of it. One of these few was
a research report on a cataclysmically deteriorated area of New York's
West Side, by Dr. Chester A. Rapkin, an economist and planner. Rapkin's
report described the imposition of a money drought from conventional
sources, the appearance of high-interest and unscrupulous money in its
stead, the inability of property owners to make changes except for the
sale of their property to exploitative purchasers. The *New York Times*,
quoting James Felt, Chairman of the City Planning Commission, for which
the report was prepared, summed it up both neatly and dispassionately:

[]{#calibre_link-1856 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="303"}He said
that it disclosed the almost complete termination of new construction in
the twenty-block area. He said it also showed a halt in the flow of bank
and other institutional mortgage loans on real property, a turnover of
property to a new type of investor, a growth of absentee ownership and
the transformation of much of the housing occupancy in the area into
furnished-room occupancy.

::: {#calibre_link-1857 .section_break}
---
:::

All three kinds of cataclysmic money have been involved in this debacle,
as they often are in city decay. First the withdrawal of all
conventional money; then ruination financed by shadow-world money; then
selection of the area by the Planning Commission as a candidate for
cataclysmic use of government money to finance renewal clearance. This
last stage makes possible cataclysmic re-entry of conventional money for
financing renewal-project construction and rehabilitation. So well do
these three different kinds of money prepare the way for each other's
cataclysms that one would be impelled to admire the process, as a highly
developed form of order in its own right, were it not so destructive to
every other form of city order. It does not represent a "conspiracy." It
is a logical outcome of logical men guided by nonsensical but
conventional city planning beliefs.

The remarkable fact, however---and a great testimony to the strength and
magnetism of many city neighborhoods in adversity---is the degree to
which they resist their financial death decrees. This was discovered in
New York City during the 1950's, after new laws required central heating
in tenement buildings. Landlords were to be recompensed for the
improvements by rent increases or tax abatements. The arrangement ran
into unexpected obstacles, and precisely in places where no particular
obstacles would have been anticipated: in socially stable areas, holding
up well, where the tenants could have absorbed the increases. Money to
do the work (at rates under 20 percent interest) was generally
unobtainable.

The difficulties of one landlord, haled into court for violation of the
law, were reported in the newspapers in December 1959, because he
happened to be a Congressman, Representative Alfred E. Santangelo, and
was therefore newsworthy. Santangelo []{#calibre_link-1861 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="304"}reported that the central heating had been
installed since inspection, and went on to recount that it had cost
\$15,000 for each of six buildings his family owned, or a total of
\$90,000. "Of this," he said, "we could get only \$23,000 from
banks---by extending a mortgage for five years, and by getting a
personal bank loan. We had to do the rest with personal family monies."

Santangelo did very well with the banks, considering the usual treatment
of requests for loans into blacklisted localities. From time to time,
the New York newspapers print letters about the problem. One such, from
a lawyer of a landlords' association early in 1959, said:

> It is common knowledge that banks and insurance companies have
> refrained from making loans or mortgages to owners of tenement houses,
> especially those located in what have been marked as undesirable areas
> in the city. Mortgages upon expiration are not renewed and owners are
> frequently compelled to resort to moneylenders who exact interest as
> high as 20% \[Note: this is conservative\] for short-term
> loans...There are owners who desire to do more than just install
> central heating. They would modernize apartments by enlarging rooms,
> placing new equipment in kitchens, installing adequate wiring...With
> doors to financing closed to them, owners have appealed to the city
> for aid and none has been forthcoming...No agency exists to help with
> the problem.

The type of building involved, whether it is a tenement or a
historically valuable old town house or a purely commercial property,
makes little difference, actually, in a blacklisted area. Just as it is
not persons who are blacklisted, as such, neither are buildings, as
such, but rather the locality, as such.

During 1959, New York embarked on a small experimental program for
conserving neighborhoods in Manhattan that on the one hand were getting
no new building, but on the other hand were judged to be far from
hopeless physically and much worth saving socially. Unfortunately,
lenders had already judged just these neighborhoods to be hopeless.
*Merely so that building violations could be corrected,* the city found
it necessary to obtain state legislation setting up a \$15,000,000
public loan fund for []{#calibre_link-1866 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="305"}property owners in such neighborhoods to draw upon. Money
for gradual change is so hard to get that a new loan authority has had
to be created to supply even a pittance for the most rock-bottom
purposes. The legislation was drawn up so ineptly that the fund, as this
is written, is almost unusable; and it is so small it cannot, in any
case, make much difference to the city.

As already indicated, blacklisted localities can get money from
conventional lenders again if the money comes in the form of a
cataclysm, and if it is thus employed to sort out incomes and uses in
some approximation of Radiant Garden City.

Dedicating a privately financed Radiant City project in Harlem the
Borough President of Manhattan hailed the occasion as most significant
because "in getting private financing the project sponsors have broken
the barrier that banks have long maintained against substantial
investment in new housing for Harlem."

The barrier, however, has been broken for no other type of investment in
Harlem than investment in project cataclysms.

Conventional credit will reappear too in a blacklisted district if the
federal government will guarantee mortgages as generously as it does for
suburban development and for new Radiant Garden City projects. But the
federal government does not guarantee mortgages in sufficient amount to
stimulate spot building or rehabilitation except in certified renewal
areas with an approved plan. An approved plan means that even existing
buildings must help shape the area into the nearest possible
approximation of Radiant Garden City. Usually these renewal plans
disperse---even from low-density areas---between one-half and two-thirds
of the original population. Again the money is used to finance
cataclysms. And it is not used to build city diversity but to erase it.
When I asked an official involved in arrangements for a "spot-clearance"
renewal district why dispersed commerce was to be rooted out (instead of
more of it stimulated), and why business was to be confined to a
monopolistic shopping center, imitating suburban life, he said, first,
that that represented good planning. He then added, "The question is
academic anyhow. We couldn't get FHA approval on loans with mixed uses
like that." He is right. There is no appreciable money available today
for nurturing []{#calibre_link-1872 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="306"}city districts fit for city life, and this is a situation
encouraged and often enforced by government. We have, therefore, no one
to blame for this but ourselves.

Still another form of respectable money is available to blacklisted
districts: public housing project money. Although there is much prating
about "vest-pocket projects," the vest in question seems to be Paul
Bunyan's. This too is money that comes, almost invariably, in
cataclysmic form, and always in the form of sorting out and
price-tagging populations.

East Harlem---like the Lower East Side---has received floods of such
money. Back in 1942, East Harlem would have looked at least as good a
possibility for unslumming as the North End. Only five years before, in
1937, a sober study of the area, sponsored by the city, saw so much of
hope and improvement occurring that it projected East Harlem as the
logical center in New York of Italian-influenced culture. The district
possessed thousands of businessmen, handling businesses so stable and
successful that in many cases the second or third generation was now
running them. It had hundreds of cultural and social organizations. It
was an area of much worn-out and poor housing (along with some good
housing and considerable unslumming housing), but also of immense
vitality and with a great hold on many of its people. The district also
possessed the city's main Puerto Rican community, which was miserably
housed, but which contained many first-comers of the Puerto Rican
immigration who were already emerging as leaders, and it contained an
immense array of Puerto Rican cultural, social and business
establishments.

After East Harlem was written off by lenders in 1942, it too had little
miracles. One area, near the foot of the Triborough Bridge, continued
unslumming and rehabilitating in spite of every obstacle. The Housing
Authority's own site managers, when they had to drive the people out so
that a huge immured slum, Wagner Houses, could be built there instead,
were amazed and mystified that improvements so substantial and plentiful
should be wiped away. No miracle sufficiently sensational turned up to
save East Harlem. To carry out their plans (even where these were not
directly overridden by the city's plans), too many people eventually had
to leave. Those who stayed in spite of the discouragement
[]{#calibre_link-1876 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="307"}to
improvement, and in spite of the havoc of the shadow-world money which
poured into every cranny it could find, hung on by extraordinary
measures and tenacity.

For it was as if East Harlem, in effect, had been decreed a backward and
deprived country, financially apart from our normal national life. Even
the branch banks were closed down throughout an area of more than
100,000 people and thousands of businesses; merchants had to go out of
the area simply to deposit their day's receipts. Even the system of
school savings accounts was removed from the district's schools.

Eventually, much as the generosity of a rich nation might well extend
massive aid to a deprived and backward country, into this district
poured massive "foreign" aid, according to decisions by absentee experts
from the remote continent inhabited by housers and planners. The aid
poured in for rehousing people---some three hundred million dollars'
worth. The more that poured in, the worse became the turmoils and
troubles of East Harlem, and still more did it become like a deprived,
backward country. More than 1,300 businesses which had the misfortune to
occupy sites marked for housing were wiped away, and an estimated
four-fifths of their proprietors ruined. More than 500 noncommercial
"store-front" establishments were also wiped away. Virtually all the
unslummed population which had hung on was rooted out and dispersed to
"better itself."

Lack of money has hardly been the trouble in East Harlem. After the
drought came fantastic floods. The money poured into East Harlem alone
from the public housing treasuries is about as much as was lost on the
Edsel. In the case of a mistake like the Edsel, a point is reached when
the expenditure is reappraised and halted. But in East Harlem, citizens
today have to fight off still more money for repetitions of mistakes
that go unappraised by those who control the money floodgates. I hope we
disburse foreign aid abroad more intelligently than we disburse it at
home.

::: {#calibre_link-1880 .section_break}

Lack of gradual money wastes city districts already inherently fit for
city life, and therefore with a great potential for rapid improvement.
It also means there is no hope for districts that lack one or more of
the conditions for generating diversity, and []{#calibre_link-1882
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="308"}need help in acquiring these
supplements, as well as money for normal changes and for worn-out
structures.

Where is the money from conventional sources, which might be going into
gradual change? Where does it go instead?

Some of it goes into planned cataclysms of redevelopment and renewal;
more is going into the self-destruction of diversity, to the ruination
of outstanding city success.

Much is not going into cities at all, but instead into the outskirts of
cities.

As Haar said, the credit authority is not only the power to destroy but
the power to create and the power to divert. He was writing specifically
of the government's credit authority, and the use of that authority to
encourage suburb building rather than city building.

The immense new suburban sprawls of American cities have not come about
by accident---and still less by the myth of free choice between cities
and suburbs. Endless suburban sprawl was made practical (and for many
families was made actually mandatory) through the creation of something
the United States lacked until the mid-1930's: a national mortgage
market specifically calculated to encourage suburban home building.
Because of the certitude offered by government mortgage guarantees, a
bank in New Haven could, would and does buy up mortgages on suburban
housing in Southern California. A bank in Chicago buys up mortgages on
suburban housing in Indianapolis one week, while an Indianapolis bank,
the next week, buys them up for suburban housing outside Atlanta or
Buffalo. Nor, nowadays, must these mortgages necessarily be government
guaranteed. They can be a repetition, without the guarantees, of the
kind of planning and building that is made routine and accepted by the
guarantees.

A national mortgage market has obvious advantages in bringing the demand
for money together with a distant supply of money quickly and
sensitively. But, particularly when it is diverted so heavily into one
kind of growth, it has its disadvantages too.

As the people of the Back-of-the-Yards found out, there is apt to be no
relationship between city-created and city-needed savings,
[]{#calibre_link-1890 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="309"}and city
building investment. So remote is the relationship that in 1959 when one
of the savings banks in Brooklyn announced that 70 percent of its loans
had been made close to home, the *New York Times* considered the fact
sufficiently newsworthy to give it a big play on the business pages.
Close to home is a definition with some elasticity. The 70 percent, it
turned out, had been used in Nassau County, a huge mess of new suburban
sprawl on Long Island, out beyond Brooklyn. Meantime, much of Brooklyn
lies under the sentence of the blacklist.

City people finance the building of suburbs. To be sure, one of the
historic missions of cities, those marvelously productive and efficient
places, is to finance colonization.

But you can run anything into the ground.

::: {#calibre_link-1893 .section_break}

:::

Obviously there have been changes in the sources of money for city
building during the past thirty years. Money lending and spending have
become more institutionalized than in the past. The counterparts of
individuals who might have been lending money in the 1920's, for
example, are today apt to be putting it into income tax and life
insurance, and insofar as it is spent or lent for city building, it is
spent or lent by the government or the life insurance company. Small
local banks, like the New England oddity that lent money within its
otherwise blacklisted neighborhood, disappeared in the Depression and in
mergers after that time.

Does this mean, however, that our more institutionalized money nowadays
can be used only cataclysmically? Are the great bureaucracies of money
such big fish that they can operate only in cities of big fish, huge
borrowers, immense and abrupt changes? Is a system which is able in one
of its manifestations to retail credit, gently, for the purchase of
encyclopedias and vacation trips, able in other manifestations only to
distribute credit violently in wholesale lots?

This city building money operates as it does not because of its own
internal necessities and forces. It operates cataclysmically because we,
as a society, have asked for just this. We thought it would be good for
us, and we got it. Now we accept it as if it were ordained by God or the
system.

[]{#calibre_link-1898 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="310"}Let us
look, from the point of view of what we have asked for and what we have
explicitly permitted, at the three kinds of money which shape our
cities---beginning with the most important, the conventional,
nongovernmental sources of credit.

The idea of diverting huge sums of money to thin suburban growth *at the
expense of starving city districts* was no invention of the mortgage
lenders (although they, as well as suburban builders, have now acquired
a vested interest in this routine). Neither the ideal nor the method of
accomplishing it originated logically within our credit system itself.
It originated with high-minded social thinkers. By the 1930's, when the
FHA methods for stimulating suburban growth were worked out, virtually
every wise man of government---from right to left---was in favor of the
objectives, although they might differ with one another on methods. A
few years previously, Herbert Hoover had opened the first White House
Conference on Housing with a polemic against the moral inferiority of
cities and a panegyric on the moral virtues of simple cottages, small
towns and grass. At an opposite political pole, Rexford G. Tugwell, the
federal administrator responsible for the New Deal's Green Belt
demonstration suburbs, explained, "My idea is to go just outside centers
of population, pick up cheap land, build a whole community and entice
people into it. Then go back into the cities and tear down whole slums
and make parks of them."

The cataclysmic use of money for suburban sprawl, and the concomitant
starvation of all those parts of cities that planning orthodoxy stamped
as slums, was what our wise men wanted for us; they put in a lot of
effort, one way and another, to get it. We got it.

The deliberate social sponsorship of cataclysmic private credit for
redevelopment and renewal projects is even more obvious. In the first
place, society puts its own land clearance subsidy funds into these
cataclysmic changes, purely to make financially possible the subsequent
cataclysmic private investment. Society also oversees that the private
investment is used *specifically* to create forms of pseudo-city and to
combat urban diversity. Society goes still further, with its incentive
of renewal mortgage guarantees, but insists that the creation thus
guaranteed be as []{#calibre_link-1902 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="311"}static as man can make it throughout the life of investment.
Gradual change is outlawed for the future.

Social sponsorship of these cataclysms is taken for granted. This is the
public's contribution to city rebuilding.

The public understands less well that in sponsoring these cataclysmic
uses of private investment in cities, it has also made and enforced
choices among various differing forms of private investment.

To understand this, we must understand that public subsidies for land
clearance or spot clearance are far from the only subsidies. Involuntary
subsidies, immense in the aggregate, go into these enterprises too.

When land is acquired for redevelopment or renewal, it is acquired
through the power of eminent domain, a power which belongs only to
governments. In addition, threat of acquisition under eminent domain is
used to enforce compliance to renewal schemes in parcels of property not
actually acquired.

The power of eminent domain, long familiar and useful as a means of
acquiring property needed for public use, is extended, under
redevelopment law, to acquisition of property intended for private use
and private profit. This distinction was the point on which the
constitutionality of redevelopment and renewal law hung. The Supreme
Court declared that society did have the right---through the medium of
its legislatures---to make that kind of choice between private
entrepreneurs and owners; it could take the property of the one to
benefit the other, as a means of achieving objects which, in the
legislature's judgment, were for the public good.

This use of the power of eminent domain does more than make physically
possible the assembly of project tracts. It also makes them financially
possible, owing to the involuntary subsidy entailed. This point of the
involuntary subsidy was well explained by Anthony J. Panuch, a
management expert, in a 1960 report on New York City's housing and
redevelopment snarl, prepared for the Mayor:

> The direct consequence of the exercise of the power of eminent domain
> on the commercial tenant is drastic and often ruinous.
> []{#calibre_link-1910 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="312"}When the
> government condemns property it is required to pay only for what it

The government is *not* in condemnation acquiring a business but only
the premises. It need only pay for the premises. The proprietor gets
nothing for the loss of his business or goodwill, nor even for his
unexpired lease because leases universally provide that upon
condemnation the owner's lease contract with the tenant is automatically
terminated with no compensation to the tenant.

Although his entire property and his full investment is taken from him,
he receives substantially nothing.

::: {#calibre_link-1913 .section_break}

:::

The report goes on to give an illustrative case:

> A druggist purchased a drug store for more than \$40,000. A few years

> condemnation. The total sum which he eventually received was an award

This is a sad and common story on housing or renewal sites, and is one
reason these schemes are fought so desperately by site businessmen. They
are subsidizing these schemes, not with a fraction of their tax money,
but with their livelihoods, with their children's college money, with
years of their past put into hopes for the future---with nearly
everything they have.

The Panuch report goes on to suggest what innumerable letters to
editors, citizens at public hearings, and newspaper editorials have
already, in their own words, suggested: "The community as a whole should
bear the expense of community progress and that cost should not be
imposed upon the unfortunate victim of community progress."

The community as a whole has not yet seen fit to bear that whole
expense, and it is never going to. Redevelopment officials and housing
experts blanch when it is suggested. The expense of bearing the whole
cost would make public subsidy costs for redevelopment and for housing
projects too heavy. At present, redevelopment for private profit is
ideologically and fiscally justified []{#calibre_link-1919 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="313"}on the grounds that the public subsidy
investment will be returned over a reasonable period in the form of
increased taxes from the improvement. Were the involuntary subsidies
which make these schemes possible included as public costs, the enlarged
public costs would bear no conceivable relationship to anticipated tax
returns. Public housing on its part is held to a current cost of
\$17,000 per dwelling unit. Were the involuntary subsidies absorbed as
public cost, the expense of these dwellings would soar to politically
unrealistic levels. Both of these operations, "renewal" projects and
public housing projects, with their wholesale destruction, are
inherently wasteful ways of rebuilding cities, and in comparison with
their full costs make pathetic contributions to city values. At present,
society is protected from these facts of life because so high a
proportion of the costs is visited upon involuntary victims and is not
officially added in. But the cost is there. Project building as a form
of city transformation makes no more sense financially than it does
socially.

When a life insurance company or a union pension fund pours cataclysmic
amounts of money into a regimented project or renewal scheme for a
price-tagged population, it is not indulging in behavior somehow
necessary to twentieth-century investment funds. It is doing, rather,
what society has specifically asked for, and has made possible only by
employing quite extraordinary and ruthless social powers.

In the case of the catclysmic use of conventional credit for the
self-destruction of diversity, the situation is different. The
cataclysmic effects in such cases arise, not from vast wholesaling of
credit at all, but from the aggregate of many individual transactions
which happen to be heavily concentrated in one locality in one period of
time. Society has produced no deliberate stimulants to this destruction
of outstanding city success. But neither has society done anything to
hamper or to divert this form of city-destroying money flood.

Private investment shapes cities, but social ideas (and laws) shape
private investment. First comes the image of what we want, then the
machinery is adapted to turn out that image. The financial machinery has
been adjusted to create anti-city images because, and only because, we
as a society thought this would be []{#calibre_link-1923 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="314"}good for us. If and when we think that
lively, diversified city, capable of continual, close-grained
improvement and change, is desirable, then we will adjust the financial
machinery to get that.

::: {#calibre_link-1924 .section_break}
---
:::

As for the cataclysmic use of public funds for city rebuilding, there is
even less reason than in the case of private credit to suppose that this
just happens because it happens. Public housing money is employed
cataclysmically instead of for gradual, steady street and district
improvement, because we thought cataclysms would be good for our slum
dwellers---and a demonstration to the rest of us of the good city life.

There is no inherent reason why tax funds and public credit cannot be
used to speed unslumming instead of slum shifting and slum immuring.
Methods entirely different from those now employed are possible for
subsidizing housing. I shall discuss this question in the next chapter.

Nor is there any inherent reason why public buildings must be sorted out
and assembled into civic and cultural cataclysms. They can be built and
located as ingredients of gradual change, to supplement and enliven
their matrix of living city. We only do it the other way because we
think it is right.

The shadow-world money is hard to control socially, but we could do much
to hamper at least its cataclysmic effects. Blacklisting of localities
opens wonderful opportunities to the cataclysmic use of exploitative
money. To this degree, the problem is hardly the exploitative money
itself, but the (socially encouraged) withholding of conventional
investment.

Cataclysmic use of governmental money also affords, as a by-product,
wonderful opportunities for the money from the shadow world. To
understand why this is so, we must understand that slum landlords,
unlike the drug-store proprietor in the Panuch report, benefit
handsomely from blanket use of the powers of eminent domain. When a
building is bought under the powers of eminent domain, three factors are
customarily taken into account in setting the award (sale price). These
are the assessed value of the property, the replacement value of the
building, and the current earning power of the *building* (as
distinguished from []{#calibre_link-1930 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="315"}the earning power of a business which may be conducted
within it). The more exploited a building, the higher its earning power,
and the more the owner is given. So profitable are such condemnation
sales for slum landlords that some of them make a business of buying up
buildings in areas already condemned, overcrowding them, and raising
rents, less for the profits to be made in the interim than for the
profits to be made by the building's sale to the public. To combat this
particular racket, some cities have passed "quick-take" laws technically
transferring to public ownership the title of properties on a condemned
site the day condemnation is approved---leaving negotiations on sale
prices and appraisals to be worked out
later.[\*^4^](#calibre_link-128){#calibre_link-132 .calibre7}

Wherever exploited buildings exist, their owners are enriched from slum
clearance. They can, and apparently often do, use their condemnation
awards to buy more property than they formerly had, in new localities
which they propose to convert to slums. If the new slum is later
condemned, so much the better for such an investor's multiplying
fortunes and holdings. In New York, some investors of this kind take not
only their money with them to a new location, but also their former
tenants, thereby helping the city solve the "relocation" problem. Slum
shifting has its own efficiencies. It is self-financing.

Again, the cataclysmic use of shadow-world money to create new slums is
hardly a problem entailing only the shadow-world money itself. To a
degree, it is a problem that arises from (socially encouraged) slum
shifting.

[]{#calibre_link-1934 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="316"}Finally,
the cataclysmic use of shadow-world money could be better controlled
through taxation, as explained in the Panuch report:

> No amount of code enforcement or tax abated housing rehabilitation by
> the New York City Housing Authority will be able to keep pace with
> slum formation, *until and unless the profit is taken out of slums by

Cynics---or at least the cynics I talk to---think that pickings are made
so easy nowadays for exploitative money in cities because the investment
shadow world represents powerful interests, with a big say somewhere
behind the legislative and administrative scenes. I have no way of
knowing whether this is true. However, I should think that apathy on the
part of the rest of us has something to do with the situation. Some
professional housers, today, have a plausible rationalization for the
profits the shadow world takes as a by-product of city rebuilding
operations. "Society has created the slums," they say, "and it is only
right that society should pay what is needed to wipe them out." Putting
it in these terms, however, evades the question of who is being paid by
society, and where the money goes next. The apathy is abetted, also, by
the comfortable thought that the problem of slums is
[]{#calibre_link-1938 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="317"}being
overcome anyway by wiping out old slum buildings. Nothing could be less
true.

It is so easy to blame the decay of cities on traffic...or
immigrants...or the whimsies of the middle class. The decay of cities
goes deeper and is more complicated. It goes right down to what we think
we want, and to our ignorance about how cities work. The forms in which
money is used for city building---or withheld from use---are powerful
instruments of city decline today. The forms in which money is used must
be converted to instruments of regeneration---from instruments buying
violent cataclysms to instruments buying continual, gradual, complex and
gentler change.

::: {#calibre_link-1940 .footnote}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\*^1^](#calibre_link-129){.calibre7} The first stage of such a
cataclysm is already being prepared in plan, in the form of a scheme for
massive clearance around historic buildings. Boston---or at least the
custodians of its tradition---are ashamed that at present tourists and
school children may be distracted by the irrelevant North End while
taking in the meaning of American freedom.

[\*^2^](#calibre_link-130){.calibre7} The leaders were Bishop Bernard J.
Sheil, Saul D. Alinsky, sociologist and criminoligist, and Joseph B.
Meegan, then a neighborhood park director. Alinsky has described the
theory and means of organizing in a book, *Reveille for Radicals*.

[\*^3^](#calibre_link-131){.calibre7} In 1960, property owners on one of
these streets got what appear to be the first conventional mortgage
loans made into East Harlem in eighteen years. They were obtained
through the good offices of John J. Merli, city councilman and a potent
figure in the New York County Committee of the Democratic party. Mr.
Merli himself first advanced the money for buying necessary materials,
and arranged for labor barter and labor donation in the fashion of the
North End. After the work was done, he managed to get bank loans for the
property owners concerned, with which they could repay the loans he had
made them for materials.

[\*^4^](#calibre_link-132){.calibre7} The point of these laws, of
course, is to prevent ownership from changing in the interim, and thus
increasing costs to the city beyond those anticipated. Quick-take laws
succeed in this, but as a by-product they work even greater hardship
than usual upon legitimate site owners. In Boston's West End, for
example, owners who occupied their own buildings were reduced to
desperation by the quick-take law. From the day of condemnation, their
tenants began paying their rent to the city instead of to the former
owner, and the owners also had to begin paying rent to the city. This
went on month after month---in some cases about a year---while the
former owner of the building was unable to move because he had not
received his money and had no idea, furthermore, what he would get.
Eventually he would accept almost anything.

# Subsidizing dwellings {#calibre_link-1952 .chaphead1}
:::

Most of the aims I have been writing about, aims such as unslumming
slums, catalyzing diversity, nurturing lively streets, are unrecognized
today as objectives of city planning. Therefore, planners and the
agencies of action that carry out plans possess neither strategies nor
tactics for carrying out such aims.

However, although city planning lacks tactics for building cities that
can work like cities, it does possess plenty of tactics. They are aimed
at carrying out strategic lunacies. Unfortunately, they are effective.

In this section, I am going to deal with several subjects that, in
themselves, are already well recognized as within the province of city
planning: subsidized dwellings, traffic, city visual design, analytical
methods. These are all matters for which conventional modern planning
does have objectives and therefore does possess tactics---so many
tactics, so well entrenched, that when their purposes are questioned
they are generally justified *in terms of the []{#calibre_link-1956
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="322"}conditions laid down by still
other tactics* (e.g., We must do this for the purpose of getting the
federal loan guarantees). We become the prisoners of our tactics, seldom
looking behind them at the strategies.

As good a place as any to begin is with the tactics for subsidizing
dwellings, because the tactics devised and embroidered over the years to
make project communities a reality for the poor have deeply infected
planning tactics for all purposes. "Did public housing fail completely?"
housing expert Charles Abrams has asked, after castigating it as
ill-conceived for its purposes and as having, in combination with
urban-renewal clearance, attained "absurdity."

He went on to answer:

> No. It proved many things...It proved that large blighted areas are
> assemblable, replannable and rebuildable. It won public acceptance of
> large-scale urban improvement and established the legal base for it.
> It proved that...housing bonds are AAA investments; that public
> provision of shelter is a government duty; that the housing authority
> mechanism can at least operate without graft. All this is no small
> accomplishment.

All that is indeed no small accomplishment. The devices of large-scale
clearance, slum shifting, slum immuring, project planning, income
sorting, use sorting have become so fixed as planning images and as
collections of tactics that city rebuilders, and most ordinary citizens
too, face a blank when they try to think of city rebuilding without
these means. To get past this obstacle, we must understand the original
misconception on which the rest of the fancy structure rests.

A friend of mine reached the age of eighteen believing that babies were
born through their mothers' navels. She got the idea as a small child,
and whatever she heard from then on, she modified and embroidered into
her initial mistake, for she was bright and ingenious. The more she
learned, the more support, therefore, she seemed to have for her notion.
She was exercising, somewhat bizarrely, one of the most universal,
ingenious and distressing of human talents. She grew a new
rationalization for every one demolished, so it was impossible to clear
away her misunderstanding []{#calibre_link-1962 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="323"}by chopping around in its outer reaches. To
topple her fancy intellectual concoction, it was necessary to begin with
the anatomy of the navel. When her first simple misunderstanding about
the nature and use of the navel was cleared up thus by her family, she
promptly exercised another clever and more heartening human talent. She
cleared away the rest of her thicket of misunderstanding with such ease
that she became a biology teacher (and subsequently produced a large
family too).

The thicket of confusion about the workings of cities which has grown
around and upon the subsidized housing project notion is no longer just
in our minds. By now it is also a thicket of legislative, financial,
architectural and analytical devices applied to cities.

Our cities contain people too poor to pay for the quality of shelter
that our public conscience (quite rightly, I think) tells us they should
have. Furthermore, in many cities the sheer supply of dwellings is too
small to accommodate the population without overcrowding, and the
quantity of additional dwellings needed does not necessarily match up
with the direct ability of the people concerned to pay for them. Because
of these reasons, we need subsidies for at least some portion of city
dwellings.

These seem like simple and straightforward reasons for dwelling
subsidies. They also leave a large leeway as to how subsidies might be
applied, both financially and physically.

But let us see how involuted and rigid these reasons can become---have
become---by giving another seemingly simple but slightly different
answer to the question: What is the reason for subsidizing dwellings in
cities?

The answer we long ago accepted went like this: The reason we need
dwelling subsidies is to provide for that part of the population which
cannot be housed by private enterprise.

And, the answer went on, so long as this is necessary anyway, the
subsidized dwellings should embody and demonstrate the principles of
good housing and planning.

This is a terrible answer, with terrible consequences. A twist of
semantics suddenly presents us with *people who cannot be housed by
private enterprise*, and hence must presumably be []{#calibre_link-1971
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="324"}housed by someone else. Yet in
real life, these are people whose housing needs are not in themselves
peculiar and thus outside the ordinary province and capability of
private enterprise, like the housing needs of prisoners, sailors at sea
or the insane. Perfectly ordinary housing needs can be provided for
almost anybody by private enterprise. What is peculiar about these
people is merely that *they cannot pay for
it*.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-133){#calibre_link-137 .calibre7}

Quicker than the eye can see, however, "people who cannot be housed by
private enterprise" have been turned into a statistical group with
peculiar shelter requirements, like prisoners, on the basis of one
statistic: their income. To carry out the rest of the answer, this
statistical group becomes a special collection of guinea pigs for
Utopians to mess around with.

Even if the Utopians had had schemes that made sense socially in cities,
it is wrong to set one part of the population, segregated by income,
apart in its own neighborhoods with its own different scheme of
community. Separate but equal makes nothing but trouble in a society
where people are not taught that caste is a part of the divine order.
Separate but better is an innate contradiction wherever the separateness
is enforced by one form of inferiority.

The notion that the fact of a subsidy required that these people be
housed by someone other than private enterprise and normal landlords was
an aberration in itself. The government does not take over the
landlordship or ownership or management of subsidized farms or of
subsidized airlines. Government does not, as a rule, take over the
running of museums that receive subsidies from public funds. It does not
take over the ownership or management of voluntary community hospitals
whose construction is today frequently made possible by government
subsidies.

Public housing stands apart from other, logically analogous forms of
capitalism and of government partnership which we []{#calibre_link-1976
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="325"}have evolved; it incorporates the
belief that government must take over a facility *purely* because
government contributes subsidy funds.

Because we lack any ideology that puts government as the landlord and
owner of public housing in context with the rest of our national life,
we have no sense about how to contend with such a thing. The
bureaucracies that build and run these places---always in terror lest
their capricious masters, the taxpayers, find fault with the tenants'
housekeeping, morals or standards of amenity and blame the
bureaucrats---are in some things impossibly arrogant and in others
impossibly timid.

Because the government is a landlord, it is in potential competition
with private landlords, and to prevent the competition from being
unfair, cartel arrangements are necessary. The population itself must be
cartelized, with people moved from the province of one cartel to another
on the basis of the money they make.

The answer that these are people "who cannot be housed by private
enterprise" was absolutely disastrous for cities too. Quicker than the
eye can see, the city as an organism has disappeared. It becomes, in
theory, a static collection of sites for planting these sorted-out sets
of statistics.

From the beginning, the whole conception was irrelevant to the nature of
the problem, irrelevant to the plain financial need of the people
concerned, irrelevant to the needs and workings of cities, irrelevant to
the rest of our economic system, and even irrelevant to the meaning of
home as it has evolved otherwise in our tradition.

The best that can be said of the conception is that it did afford a
chance to experiment with some physical and social planning theories
which did not pan out.

The problem of how to administer subsidies for people unable to carry
their own dwelling costs is fundamentally the problem of how to make up
the difference between what they can pay and what their shelter costs.
The shelter can be provided by private owners and landlords, and the
difference made up to the owners---either directly to them in the form
of subsidy payments, or indirectly in the form of rent supplements to
the tenants themselves. []{#calibre_link-1984 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="326"}There is no end of tactics by which the subsidy can be
injected---in old buildings, new buildings, rehabilitated buildings.

I shall suggest one method here---not because it is the only reasonable
method by any means, but because it is a method capable of helping to
solve some of the most currently difficult problems of city improvement.
In particular, it is a means of introducing new construction gradually
instead of cataclysmically, of introducing new construction as an
ingredient of neighborhood diversity instead of as a form of
standardization, of getting new private construction into blacklisted
districts, and of helping to unslum slums more rapidly. It can do its
share toward helping to solve other problems too, as we shall see, along
with its basic usefulness as shelter.

This method I am proposing can be called the guaranteed-rent method. The
physical units involved would be buildings, not projects---buildings to
go among other buildings, old and new, on city streets. These
guaranteed-rent buildings would be of different kinds and sizes,
depending on their kind of neighborhood, the size of the plot, and all
such considerations as normally influence the size and type of more or
less average dwellings.

To induce private owners to erect these buildings in neighborhoods where
they are needed to replace worn-out buildings or to augment the supply
of dwellings, the government agency involved, which I shall call the
Office of Dwelling Subsidies (ODS), would make two kinds of guarantees
to builders.

First, the ODS would guarantee to the builder that he would get the
financing necessary for construction. If the builder could get a loan
from a conventional lending institution, the ODS would guarantee the
mortgage. If he could not get such a loan, however, the ODS would itself
lend the money---a backstop facility necessary because of the existence
of concerted credit blacklisting of city localities by conventional
lenders, and necessary only to the extent that loans from conventional
sources, at reasonably low interest rates for guaranteed mortgages, were
unobtainable for the program.

Second, the ODS would guarantee to these builders (or to the owners to
whom the buildings might subsequently be sold) a rent
[]{#calibre_link-1990 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="327"}for the
dwellings in the building sufficient to carry them economically.

In return for making financing available, and for guaranteeing the
building an assured rental income for all occupied apartments, the ODS
would require that the owner (a) build his building in a designated
neighborhood and sometimes in a designated spot there, and (b) in most
cases, that he select his tenants from among applicants within a
designated area or designated group of buildings. This would usually be
from an area close by, but in some cases might not be. We shall see soon
why such conditions are useful, but first it is necessary to mention the
third, and last, function of the subsidizing agency, the ODS.

*After* the landlord had selected his tenants from among the applicants,
the ODS would then look into the incomes of the tenants selected. It
would not be empowered to examine any other facts about them, other than
their incomes and the fact that they had come from the area or buildings
designated. We possess bodies of law and agencies of action on all
relevant associated matters, such as landlord-tenant obligations, police
powers, social welfare, and the ODS should assume no such functions for
itself. This is no vague, futile and humiliating transaction in
all-purpose uplift of the human soul. It is a dignified, businesslike
transaction in shelter rental, no more, no less.

Those tenants who could not pay an economic rent (their full share of
costs) would, at least in the beginning of such a program, be most or
all of the tenants applying. The ODS would make up the difference. These
examinations of income, taking the size of the household into
consideration, would be on an annual basis, similar to income tax
declaration. This is a concept already used in public housing (where it
is combined with too much gratuitous snooping and talebearing about
other matters entirely), and it is a concept we use, quite well, for
many other purposes. For instance, colleges and universities use this
technique in allocating scholarship funds granted on the basis of need.

If a household's income improved, its proportion of the rent would go
up, and the proportion provided by the subsidy would go down. If and
when a household reached the point of paying a []{#calibre_link-1995
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="328"}full economic rent, it would
thereafter---for as long as this was true---be no concern of the ODS.
Such a household or individual could stay on in the dwelling forever,
paying the economic rent.

The more successfully such guaranteed-rent buildings were able to hold
tenants as their financial condition improved, the more rent subsidy
would be available for more buildings, and for other households. The
degree to which the program encouraged stability and accompanying
self-diversification among people would be directly tied to the degree
and speed with which the construction program could expand on a given
amount of rent subsidy. It would have to be responsive to the needs of
people who develop choice, and to the principles of building magnetic,
safe, interesting neighborhoods in which people stay by choice. Insofar
as it might fail in these respects, its own failure would automatically
hamper its expansion. Expansion would represent no threat to private
builders and landlords (as the expansion of public housing does),
because private builders and landlords would be the direct proprietors
of the expansion. Nor need it represent any threat to private lending
institutions, for the functions of these institutions would be
supplanted only insofar as they themselves did not wish to participate
in the capital cost financing.

The guarantee of annual economic rent to the owner would extend over the
amortization period for the mortgage. This might vary between thirty and
fifty years, and such variation would be desirable because it would be
one of the factors encouraging different types of buildings, and also
because it would introduce variability in the age at which the
rent-guaranteed building could be torn down or converted to quite
different uses. To be sure, as time wore on, simply the gradual
continuity of new building in a district, by this means and by other
means, would bring an eventual variation in the time at which the
buildings' lives, or original uses, could terminate if necessary.

A definition of economic rent would include fixed amortization and debt
service costs, maintenance and running expenses which would have to be
adjusted to meet changes in purchasing power (a common condition taken
into account for many otherwise fixed rental or carrying charge costs),
a profit or profit-and-management []{#calibre_link-1999 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="329"}figure, and real estate taxes, a point to
which I shall return later in this chapter.

The owner could be required to put into the building an equity slightly
below that currently required for FHA guaranteed loans to suburban
development, to help begin redressing the balance which has been
draining cities of building money.

In the end, most of the subsidy involved in guaranteed-rent dwellings
would be subsidy to pay for capital costs of building---just as this is
the use of the subsidy in public housing. However, tactically, the
process would be the opposite from the method used in public housing.

In public housing, the capital costs of building are directly borne by
government. The local housing authorities issue long-term bonds to cover
construction costs. Federal grants (in some cases, state grants) cover
these bond payments. The rents of the low-income tenants pay only for
local administrative costs, running expenses and maintenance---all of
which, incidentally, are very high in public housing. Public housing
tenants buy, with their rent money, more mimeograph paper, more
conference time, and more combaters of vandalism than any renters since
the world began. In public housing, rents are subsidized by the device
of subsidizing capital costs directly, and removing them from the
equation.

Under the guaranteed-rent system, the capital costs would be kept in the
rent equation. The amortization of capital would be included in the
rent, and insofar as it was necessary to subsidize rents, capital cost
would be subsidized automatically. Either way, directly or through
rents, capital costs have to be paid. The advantage of subsidizing them
through rent subsidy is this: The capital subsidy becomes much more
flexible in its application to tenants. It need not in the least be used
to sort out people of this income and that income, as must be done when
the capital subsidy is a fixed factor, built rigidly into the fact of
tenancy itself.

Another fixed factor which segregates people by income today in
subsidized construction could be eliminated under a system of
guaranteed-rent construction. This is the matter of real estate tax
abatement or tax elimination. Under public ownership, most low-income
projects pay no real estate taxes. Many middle-income
[]{#calibre_link-2005 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="330"}projects
are given tax abatements or tax postponements to help bring down their
rents or, in the case of cooperatives, their carrying charges. These are
all forms of subsidy, and they require concomitant income limitations on
tenants---at the very least, at their time of entry---so that those who
are best able to pay real estate taxes as a part of their shelter costs
will not be getting too blatant a free ride on other taxpayers.

Under a guaranteed-rent system, real estate taxes could and should be
included in the rent; as in the case of capital costs, the degree to
which these were subsidized for a household or individual would not be a
rigid, built-in factor of the building, but would vary depending on the
tenants' own (varying) abilities to carry their share of rental costs.

Since rent subsidies would have to come from federal grants, as almost
all public housing subsidies do today, this would make the federal
government, in effect, an indirect but substantial contributor to
municipal real estate tax funds derived from dwellings. But again, the
difference is mainly one of tactics in the use of subsidies. At present,
federal housing subsidies are buying, directly and indirectly, many
facilities and operations which are in essence normal city running
expenses, warped into abnormal forms to fit the physical and financial
formulas demanded by the project conception. For instance, federal
grants pay for capital costs of project Turfs and public meeting rooms,
game rooms, clinic spaces, and the like; indirectly---by picking up so
much of the total tab---they pay for housing authority police and
housing authority social and community workers. If the subsidy excluded
such expenses---because they would no longer be relevant to the
product---but included real estate tax, this could help pay for some of
the things cities need desperately, such as well-placed neighborhood
*public* parks instead of hostile project Turfs, police instead of
authority police, building violation inspectors instead of authority
maintenance checkers.

Aside from some requirements as to numbers of rooms in dwelling units
(so that too many dwellings would not end up the same size), the ODS
should have no responsibility or power to enforce its own standards of
design or of construction. The physical standards and regulations
applying should be those embodied []{#calibre_link-2009 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="331"}in a city's own codes and body of
regulations, and should therefore be the same for guaranteed-rent
dwellings as they would be for any unsubsidized building at the same
place. If it is public policy to improve or to change dwelling standards
for safety, sanitation, amenity or street design, then this public
policy must be expressed for the public---not for an arbitrarily
selected, guinea-pig part of the public.

If the owner of a guaranteed-rent building wished to include commerce or
other nonresidential use on the ground or basement floors, or both, the
pro-rated costs of this space would simply not be included in the rent
guarantee or financing guarantee. Both his costs and his income from
this show of salutary enterprise would be over and above his
arrangements with the ODS.

Since this kind of subsidized construction would not entail large-scale
assembly and clearance, plots of land for guaranteed-rent dwellings
would, in most cases, hardly require use of the power of eminent domain.
Sales of plots within neighborhoods designated as eligible could
normally be made as they generally are in private building operations,
based on who is willing to sell at what price. To be sure, the cost of
the plot would have to be absorbed, but let us remember that with such a
system as this we are eliminating the necessity for the large-scale land
clearance costs we now find it necessary to
subsidize.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-134){#calibre_link-138 .calibre7}

In cases where powers of eminent domain were used, the purchase price
should include the realistic, full costs---such as value of unexpired
business leases, or full and realistic moving and relocation costs for
business, as is done in the case of private sales where business tenants
are hardly expected to ante up a self-destroying involuntary subsidy
toward someone else's plan.

The purpose of paying, rather than exacting unjust involuntary
subsidies, would be to avoid killing off city diversity gratuitously. To
have to pay would, on the one hand, make it realistically
[]{#calibre_link-2014 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="332"}possible
for dislocated enterprises to relocate and continue to live (preferably
within the neighborhood) and would, on the other hand, enforce automatic
selectivity of what was destroyed. This kind of selectivity---allowing
that which is worth more to remain---is utterly missing from current
city rebuilding tactics, and is one reason why these are so
fantastically wasteful of city economic assets. The point behind
guaranteed-rent dwellings would be to build further on whatever success,
or potentiality for success, already exists.

Again, because the method would entail no necessity for large-scale
clearance and rebuilding, the program could include great numbers of
builders and owners, thousands of them. It is ridiculous to consider
that our great cities---various, vital, ever changing---should depend
for rebuilding on a handful of authorities and huge builder barons.
Owners of multiple-dwelling guaranteed-rent buildings should, if they
wished, be able themselves to live in the buildings---just as if they
were tenants---and this would be salutary, as on-the-spot ownership so
often is. It should by no means be a requirement, but it could be
encouraged by encouraging such participation in the building program or,
more realistically, by not preventing sale by builders to such owners.

::: {#calibre_link-2016 .section_break}

:::

If we possessed such a tactic as guaranteed-rent construction, how might
we use it?

Previously, I mentioned two conditions which it would be necessary to
require of owners, in return for the guarantees given them: The
buildings must go within designated neighborhoods and sometimes in a
designated spot; and in most cases it would be required that tenants be
selected from among applicants currently living within some area, or
along some street, or in some group of buildings designated.

With these two simple conditions on builders, it would be possible to
accomplish deliberately several different things, depending on the
specific problems of a specific place.

It would be possible, for instance, to stimulate new construction in
currently blacklisted localities where the lack becomes crucial, and to
do it by helping to retain, at the same time, people already within the
neighborhood.

[]{#calibre_link-2022 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="333"}It would be
possible deliberately to increase net numbers of dwelling units in
neighborhoods where this is needed, and to combine this increase with
simultaneous uncrowding of nearby older buildings (the legal occupancy
rates of which could become, at last, practical to enforce).

It would be possible to retain in a neighborhood people whose present
dwelling must be demolished, either to make way for another use or
because they are worn out.

It would be possible to introduce, or to increase to effective
proportions, residence as an ingredient of primary use---where that
primary use is needed as a supplement to other primary ingredients of
the city mixture, such as work.

It would be possible to help fill in gaps that occur in new frontages
created where new streets are cut through blocks that were previously
too long.

It would be possible to add to an area's basic stock of diversity in
building ages and types.

It would be possible to bring down densities of dwelling units in those
exceptional areas where dwelling densities are too high, and it could do
this sufficiently gradually to avoid cataclysmic mass upheavals of
population.

And it would be possible to do these things while mixing income levels
and encouraging the mixture to increase with time.

These are all means for abetting stability of population and diversity
of population---some of them directly, by helping to make it possible
for people who want to stay put in a neighborhood to stay put; and some
of them indirectly (insofar as *one* portion of *one* of the many
different uses in a city can do its share), by helping to create lively,
safe, interesting, varied streets and districts in which people will
stay put by choice.

Furthermore, because such a program would introduce into any one place
gradual money and gradual change, it would not prevent concurrent or
subsequent entrance into the neighborhood of people with choice, or of
unsubsidized building. (Let us hope that this would be halted short of
the self-destruction of diversity.) Nor would it prevent entrance into
the neighborhood of other newcomers, including those whose only choice
is expediency. For there would be in a neighborhood, at any one time,
many []{#calibre_link-2031 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="334"}other
buildings which were not deliberately being used for relocation
stability, and to which geographical origin of tenants would therefore
not apply.

No matter how old the buildings in a locality, no matter how great the
necessity for eventual replacement of all or nearly all, this process
should not occur in one swoop.

Too rapid replacement, besides militating economically against city
diversity, and bringing on the standardized, denatured effect of project
building, would also work at cross-purposes to the aim of holding as
many people as possible by choice over time---people in old buildings as
well as new, and people with ideas of their own about building or
rehabilitation.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-135){#calibre_link-139 .calibre7}

There is, of course, much opportunity for corruption or chiseling in a
system of rent guarantees and guaranteed financing for new building.
Corruption, chiseling and finagling we can hold down reasonably well,
when we choose to. (Think how []{#calibre_link-2036 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="335"}lucky we are to live in a country where we
can do so.) More difficult to combat is stultification.

We may be sure that any specific tactics for subsidizing dwellings are
almost certain to get more and more routine, with more rigid results,
diverging steadily, as time goes on, from the needs of the real world.
Any imagination comes in at the beginning, and is inexorably whittled
down from then on. Corruption, on the other hand---either corruption for
the sake of money or corruption for the sake of power---has a different
nature from that of strait-laced bureaucracy. Corruption grows more
inventive, rather than less so, the longer it has an object to play
with.

To combat both stultification and corruption, we ought, every eight or
ten years at least, to try out new methods of subsidizing dwellings or
add variations to old ones that are working well enough for us to
retain. We ought even to call into being entirely new agencies for these
new jobs, from time to time, and let old ones fade away. In any case, it
is always necessary to check tactics against the specific needs that
become evident in specific places. We should always be asking, "Does
this device do the job needed *here?* And if not, what would?"
Deliberate, periodic changes in tactics of subsidy would afford
opportunity to meet new needs that become apparent over time, but that
nobody can foresee in advance. This observation is, obliquely, a warning
against the limitations of my own prescriptions in this book. I think
they make sense for things as they are, which is the only place ever
possible to begin. But that does not mean that they would make the best
sense, or even good sense, after our cities had undergone substantial
improvement and great increase in vitality. Nor may they make sense if
the current mishandling of our cities continues, and we lose
constructive forms of behavior and forces on which we can still depend
and still build.

Many variations are possible, even today, among methods of subsidy, so
long as these are based on flexible and gradual change instead of
cataclysms. James Rouse, a Baltimore mortgage banker and a civic leader
in various city renewal and rebuilding efforts, has suggested, for
example, a variation leading to eventual ownership by tenants---an idea
most reasonable for places where row housing is a predominant dwelling
type:

[]{#calibre_link-2041 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="336"}Public
housing is not properly an end in itself. It can only be justified as a
means to an end of making our cities fit places in which to live. What
kind of public housing should it be?...The tenant's rent should be
increased with his increase in income and he should not be evicted as an
over-income tenant. When his increasing rent reaches the point at which
it will cover debt service, on liberal mortgage terms, then the property
should be deeded to him at its book value and his rent converted into a
mortgage payment. Such a program would move not only the individual but
also his home back into the free market stream. This would block off the
formation of public housing ghettos and it would curtail the empire
protection complex which now surrounds the program...

Charles Platt, a New York architect, has long advocated the use of
subsidized new dwellings in combination with older nearby buildings as a
tool of uncrowding and thereby of two improvements in one. William
Wheaton, professor of city planning at the University of Pennsylvania,
has made eloquent pleas for the concept of a revolving supply of public
housing, and for its indis­tingu­ishab­ility from the variety of private
housing in a community. Vernon De Mars, California architect, has
proposed a system of privately built and owned housing, much like that I
have called the guaranteed-rent system, for which anyone would be
eligible and to which government housing agencies could also send
subsidized tenants.

Stanley Tankel, a planner for the Regional Plan Association in New York,
has asked:

Virtually all observers of public housing have, sooner or later,
inveighed against the destructiveness of tenant income limitations and
have advocated their
abandonment.[\*^4^](#calibre_link-136){#calibre_link-140 .calibre7} The
proposal of guaranteed-rent dwellings which I have suggested contains no
original ideas of my own; I have simply combined into one related system
ideas put forward by many others.

Why have such ideas not already been incorporated into the concept of
public housing?

The answer is already given within the question.

The ideas are not used precisely because they are generally conceived
and proposed as modifications to be *incorporated* either into the
project conception itself, or else into the conception of public
ownership of subsidized housing. Both these basic ideas of public
housing are hopelessly unfit for good city building in our society. The
tactics shaped to achieve them---slum immuring, slum shifting, income
sorting, standardization---are bad in human terms and bad in terms of
city economic needs, but they are good and logical tactics for project
building or for bureaucratic ownership and management. Indeed, any other
tactics for these ends are so illogical and forced, that attempts to
*incorporate* them peter out before the ink is dry on the public
relations releases.

We need new tactics for subsidizing dwellings, but hardly because the
existing tactics need fiddling and diddling with. We need them because
we require different aims of city building, and new strategy for
overcoming slums and for retaining diversity of population, too, in
places that are no longer slums. The different aims and the new strategy
need their own appropriate and entirely different tactics.

brilliant U. S. Public Health Service official who developed the federal
program of hospital construction aid and administered it for many years,
kept pasted in his desk drawer a piece of paper he looked at from time
to time to remind himself of something. It said, "A fool can put on his
own clothes better than a wise man can do it for him."

[\*^2^](#calibre_link-138){.calibre7} This policy is already sometimes
applied to purchases under eminent domain, when cities are aware that
injustice to victims of their plans will result in bad political trouble
for their plans. Thus New York City, in buying land upstate to be
flooded for water supply operations, has obtained state enabling
legislation to permit it to pay fair and full costs to dislocated
businesses, even including purchase of business good will.

[\*^3^](#calibre_link-139){.calibre7} A word here about rats. This is
one of the elementary evils that new housing is supposed to eliminate
and the presence of old housing to perpetuate. But rats do not know
that. Unless they are exterminated, when old rat-infested buildings are
torn down, the rats simply move into the next inhabited area. One of the
severe problems in the Lower East Side of New York, as this is written,
is the influx of rats and other vermin from the demolished buildings on
the site of a huge new cooperative project, Seward Houses. When a large
part of the downtown of St. Louis was demolished, the displaced rats
invaded buildings over many square miles. If extermination is not
practiced in new buildings, the progeny of the rats come right back
there too. Most cities have legal requirements that rats be exterminated
in any building demolished; in New York, the going rate in 1960 for a
lying certificate of extermination, paid by corrupt owners to corrupt
exterminators, is \$5. How public agencies, like the Housing Authority,
evade the law I do not know, but to know that they do evade it one need
only go look at the fearful rat festivals and exoduses at twilight from
their sites in process of demolition. New buildings do not get rid of
rats. Only people get rid of rats. This can be done in old buildings
about as easily as in new ones. Our building was overrun with rats---big
ones---when we got it. It costs \$48 a year to keep it thoroughly rid of
them and all other vermin. A live man does it. The notion that buildings
get rid of rats is worse than a delusion because it becomes an excuse
for not exterminating rats. ("We are soon going to get rid of these
rat-infested buildings.") We expect too much of new buildings, and too
little of ourselves.

# Erosion of cities or attrition of automobiles {#calibre_link-2057 .chaphead1}
:::

Today everyone who values cities is disturbed by automobiles.

Traffic arteries, along with parking lots, gas stations and drive-ins,
are powerful and insistent instruments of city destruction. To
accommodate them, city streets are broken down into loose sprawls,
incoherent and vacuous for anyone afoot. Downtowns and other
neighborhoods that are marvels of close-grained intricacy and compact
mutual support are casually disemboweled. Landmarks are crumbled or are
so sundered from their contexts in city life as to become irrelevant
trivialities. City character is blurred until every place becomes more
like every other place, all adding up to Noplace. And in the areas most
defeated, uses that cannot stand functionally alone---shopping malls, or
residences, or places of public assembly, or centers of work---are
severed from one another.

But we blame automobiles for too much.

Suppose automobiles had never been invented, or that they had
[]{#calibre_link-2062 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="339"}been
neglected and we traveled instead in efficient, convenient, speedy,
comfortable, mechanized mass transit. Undoubtedly we would save immense
sums which might be put to better use. But they might not.

For suppose we had also been rebuilding, expanding and reorganizing
cities according to the project image and the other anti-city ideals of
conventional planning.

We would have essentially the same results as I blamed on automobiles a
few paragraphs back. These results can be repeated word for word: The
city streets would be broken down into loose sprawls, incoherent and
vacuous for anyone afoot. Downtowns and other neighborhoods that are
marvels of close-grained intricacy and compact mutual support would be
casually disemboweled. Landmarks would be crumbled or so sundered from
their contexts in city life as to become irrelevant trivialities. City
character would be blurred until every place became more like every
other place, all adding up to Noplace. And in the areas most defeated,
etc.

And then the automobile would have to be invented or would have to be
rescued from neglect. For people to live or work in such inconvenient
cities, automobiles would be necessary to spare them from vacuity,
danger and utter insti­tutio­naliz­ation.

It is questionable how much of the destruction wrought by automobiles on
cities is really a response to transportation and traffic needs, and how
much of it is owing to sheer disrespect for other city needs, uses and
functions. Like city rebuilders who face a blank when they try to think
of what to do instead of renewal projects, because they know of no other
respectable principles for city organization, just so, highwaymen,
traffic engineers and city rebuilders, again, face a blank when they try
to think what they can realistically do, day by day, except try to
overcome traffic kinks as they occur and apply what foresight they can
toward moving and storing more cars in the future. It is impossible for
responsible and practical men to discard unfit tactics---even when the
results of their own work cause them misgivings---if the alternative is
to be left with confusion as to what to try instead and why.

Good transportation and communication are not only among
[]{#calibre_link-2068 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="340"}the most
difficult things to achieve; they are also basic necessities. The point
of cities is multiplicity of choice. It is impossible to take advantage
of multiplicity of choice without being able to get around easily. Nor
will multiplicity of choice even exist if it cannot be stimulated by
cross-use. Furthermore, the economic foundation of cities is trade. Even
manufacturing occurs in cities mainly because of attached advantages
involving trade, not because it is easier to manufacture things in
cities. Trade in ideas, services, skills and personnel, and certainly in
goods, demands efficient, fluid transportation and communication.

But multiplicity of choice and intensive city trading depend also on
immense concentrations of people, and on intricate minglings of uses and
complex interweaving of paths.

How to accommodate city transportation without destroying the related
intricate and concentrated land use?---this is the question. Or, going
at it the other way, how to accommodate intricate and concentrated city
land use without destroying the related transportation?

Nowadays there is a myth that city streets, so patently inadequate for
floods of automobiles, are antiquated vestiges of horse-and-buggy
conditions, suitable to the traffic of their time, but...

Nothing could be less true. To be sure, the streets of eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century cities were usually well adapted, as streets, to the
uses of people afoot and to the mutual support of the mingled uses
bordering them. But they were miserably adapted, as streets, to horse
traffic, and this in turn made them poorly adapted in many ways to foot
traffic too.

Victor Gruen, who devised a plan for an automobile-free downtown for
Fort Worth, Texas, about which I shall say more later in this chapter,
prepared a series of slides to explain his scheme. After a view of a
street with a familiar-looking automobile jam, he showed a surprise:
just about as bad a jam of horses and vehicles in an old photograph of
Fort Worth.

What street life was like for really big and intense cities and their
users in the horse-and-buggy days has been described by an English
architect, the late H. B. Creswell, who wrote for the
[]{#calibre_link-2075 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="341"}British
*Architectural Review* of December 1958 a description of London in 1890,
when he was a young man:

> The Strand of those days...was the throbbing heart of the people's
> essential London. Hedged by a maze of continuous alleys and courts,
> the Strand was fronted by numbers of little restaurants whose windows
> vaunted exquisite feeding; taverns, dives, oyster and wine bars, ham
> and beef shops; and small shops marketing a lively variety of curious
> or workaday things all standing in rank, shoulder to shoulder, to fill
> the spaces between its many theatres...But the
> mud\![\*^1^](#calibre_link-141){#calibre_link-146 .calibre7} And the
> noise! And the smell! All these blemishes were \[the\] mark of \[the\]
> horse...

The whole of London's crowded wheeled traffic---which in parts of the
City was at times dense beyond movement---was dependent on the horse:
lorry, wagon, bus, hansom and "growler," and coaches and carriages and
private vehicles of all kinds, were appendages to horses. Meredith
refers to the "anticipatory stench of its cab-stands" on railway
approach to London: but the characteristic aroma---for the nose
recognized London with gay excitement---was of stables, which were
commonly of three or four storeys with inclined ways zigzagging up the
faces of them; \[their\] middens kept the castiron filigree chandeliers,
that glorified the reception rooms of upper and lower middle class homes
throughout London, encrusted with dead flies and, in late summer, veiled
with jiving clouds of them.

A more assertive mark of the horse was the mud that, despite the
activities of a numerous corps of red-jacketed boys who dodged among
wheels and hooves with pan and brush in service to iron bins at the
pavement-edge, either flooded the streets with churnings of "pea soup"
that at times collected in pools over-brimming the kerbs, and at others
covered the road-surface as with axle grease or bran-laden dust to the
distraction of the wayfarer. In the first case, the swift-moving hansom
or gig would fling sheets of such soup---where not intercepted by
trousers or skirts---completely across the pavement, so that the
frontages of the Strand throughout its length had an eighteen-inch
plinth of mud-parge thus imposed upon it. The pea-soup condition was met
by wheeled "mud-carts" each attended by two ladlers
[]{#calibre_link-2079 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="342"}clothed as
for Icelandic seas in thigh boots, oilskins collared to the chin, and
sou'westers sealing in the back of the neck. Splash Ho! The foot
passenger now gets the mud in his eye! The axlegrease condition was met
by horse-mechanized brushes and travellers in the small hours found
fire-hoses washing away residues...

And after the mud the noise, which, again endowed by the horse, surged
like a mighty heart-beat in the central districts of London's life. It
was a thing beyond all imaginings. The streets of workaday London were
uniformly paved in "granite" sets...and the hammering of a multitude of
iron-shod hairy heels upon \[them\], the deafening, side-drum tatoo of
tyred wheels jarring from the apex of one set to the next like sticks
dragging along a fence; the creaking and groaning and chirping and
rattling of vehicles, light and heavy, thus maltreated; the jangling of
chain harness and the clanging or jingling of every other conceivable
thing else, augmented by the shrieking and bellowings called for from
those of God's creatures who desired to impart information or proffer a
request vocally---raised a din that...is beyond conception. It was not
any such paltry thing as noise. It was an immensity of sound...

This was the London of Ebenezer Howard, and it is hardly surprising that
he regarded city streets as unfit for human beings.

Le Corbusier, when he designed his Radiant City of the 1920's, as a
park, skyscraper and automobile freeway version of Howard's small-town
Garden City, flattered himself that he was designing for a new age and,
along with it, for a new system of traffic. He was not. So far as the
new age was concerned, he was merely adapting in a shallow fashion
reforms that had been a response to nostalgic yearnings for a bygone
simpler life, and a response also to the nineteenth-century city of the
horse (and the epidemic). So far as the new system of traffic was
concerned, he was equally shallow. He embroidered (I think that is a
fair word for his approach) freeways and traffic onto his Radiant City
scheme in quantities that apparently satisfied his sense of design, but
that bore no relationship whatsoever to the hugely greater quantities of
automobiles, amounts of roadway and extent of parking and servicing
which would actually be necessary for his repetitive
[]{#calibre_link-2084 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="343"}vertical
concentrations of people, separated by vacuities. His vision of
skyscrapers in the park degenerates in real life into skyscrapers in
parking lots. And there can never be enough parking.

The present relationship between cities and automobiles represents, in
short, one of those jokes that history sometimes plays on progress. The
interval of the automobile's development as everyday transportation has
corresponded precisely with the interval during which the ideal of the
suburbanized anti-city was developed architecturally, sociologically,
legislatively and financially.

But automobiles are hardly inherent destroyers of cities. If we would
stop telling ourselves fairy tales about the suitability and charm of
nineteenth-century streets for horse-and-buggy traffic, we would see
that the internal combustion engine, as it came on the scene, was
potentially an excellent instrument for abetting city intensity, and at
the same time for liberating cities from one of their noxious
liabilities.

Not only are automotive engines quieter and cleaner than horses but,
even more important, fewer engines than horses can do a given amount of
work. The power of mechanized vehicles, and their greater speed than
horses, can make it easier to reconcile great concentrations of people
with efficient movement of people and goods. At the turn of the century,
railroads had already long demonstrated that iron horses are fine
instruments for reconciling concentration and movement. Automobiles,
including trucks, offered, for places railroads could not go, and for
jobs railroads could not do, another means of cutting down the
immemorial vehicular congestion of cities.

We went awry by replacing, in effect, each horse on the crowded city
streets with half a dozen or so mechanized vehicles, instead of using
each mechanized vehicle to replace half a dozen or so horses. The
mechanical vehicles, in their overabundance, work slothfully and idle
much. As one consequence of such low efficiency, the powerful and speedy
vehicles, choked by their own redundancy, don't move much faster than
horses.

Trucks, by and large, do accomplish much of what might have been hoped
for from mechanical vehicles in cities. They do the work of much greater
numbers of horse-drawn vehicles or of burden-laden men. But because
passenger vehicles do not, this []{#calibre_link-2090 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="344"}congestion, in turn, greatly cuts down the
efficiency of the trucks.

Today, those in despair at the war between those potential allies,
automobiles and cities, are apt to depict the impasse as a war between
automobiles and pedestrians.

It is fashionable to suppose that the solution lies in designating
certain places for pedestrians, and certain other places for vehicles.
We may be able to make such separations eventually, if we find we really
want to. But such schemes are only practical, in any case, if they
*presuppose* a spectacular decline in the absolute numbers of
automobiles using a city. Otherwise, the necessary parking, garaging and
access arteries around the pedestrian preserves reach such unwieldy and
deadening proportions that they become arrangements capable only of city
disintegration, not of city saving.

The most famous of pedestrian schemes is the Gruen plan for the downtown
of Fort Worth. The firm of Victor Gruen Associates, architects and
planners, proposed that an area of roughly a square mile be circled with
a ring road feeding into six huge, oblong garages, holding ten thousand
cars each, which would each penetrate from the ring-road perimeter deep
into the downtown area. The rest of the area would be kept free of
automobiles and would be intensively developed as a downtown of mixed
uses. The scheme has run into political opposition in Fort Worth, but
imitative plans have been proposed for more than ninety cities and have
been tried in a few. Unfortunately, the imitators ignore the salient
fact that the scheme treated the entire part of Fort Worth which could
be described as citylike in the form of one interlocked, uninterrupted
whole, and in these terms it made sense; to this extent, it was an
instrument of concentration rather than separation; to this extent, it
fostered greater complexity rather than greater simplicity. In the
imitations, the idea is almost invariably perverted into dinky and timid
designs for isolating a few shopping streets in the fashion of suburban
shopping malls, and surrounding them with dead borders of parking and
access.

This is about all that can be done---and indeed it is all that could
have been planned for Fort Worth---unless a problem much more difficult
than shrub-planting and bench-installing is faced. []{#calibre_link-2096
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="345"}This problem is how to cut down
drastically the absolute numbers of vehicles using a city.

In the case of the Gruen plan for Fort Worth, Gruen had to presuppose
such a decrease, even though the city is relatively small and simple in
comparison with our great cities, and even though the arrangements for
cars were enormous and elaborate. Part of Gruen's scheme included
arrangements for express bus service tying the downtown into the whole
city and its suburbs, and absorbing a far higher ratio of downtown users
than is now served by public transportation. Without such an arrangement
and such a presupposition, the ring-road scheme would have been
unrealistic embroidery in the Le Corbusier tradition of wishful
frivolity, or else---the difficulties faced realistically---it would
have meant converting virtually the entire downtown to garages and
rendering the ring road inadequate for access. To be sure, a greatly
enlarged perimeter might have served, with the garages disposed far out,
but then the practicality of a concentrated, intense district, readily
used on foot, would have been defeated. The plan would have no point.

Some varieties of traffic separation, conceived for heavily congested
downtown streets, envision not a horizontal separation as in the Gruen
scheme, but a vertical separation with either the pedestrians put above
the automobiles on an upper street level, or the automobiles put above
the pedestrians. But removing pedestrians gives very little more room to
cars. To provide roadbeds of the dimensions needed for the cars that
bring in the pedestrians---which is the cause of the congestion and the
reason for the separation---means stretching the dimensions of the
corresponding pedestrian levels to the point of self-cancellation of
pedestrian convenience. These schemes too, to be practical either for
cars or for the pedestrians, must presuppose a drastic reduction in
absolute numbers of automobiles, and much greater dependence on public
transportation instead.

And there is another difficulty behind pedestrian schemes. Most city
enterprises which are a response to pedestrian street use, and which,
reciprocally, generate more pedestrian street use, themselves need
convenient access to vehicles for services, supplies or transport of
their own products.

[]{#calibre_link-2101 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="346"}If
vehicular and pedestrian traffic are completely separated, one of two
alternatives must be accepted.

The first alternative is that the preserves for the pedestrians must be
streets which do not contain such enterprises. This is automatically an
absurdity. These absurdities can be found, in real life, and just as
might be expected, the preserves are empty. The pedestrians are in the
vehicular streets, where the enterprises are. This type of built-in
contradiction afflicts much grandiose "city of tomorrow" planning.

The other alternative is that it is necessary to devise schemes of
vehicular servicing, separated from the pedestrian preserves.

Gruen's scheme for Fort Worth handled the servicing problem with a
system of underground tunnels for trucks and for taxi service to hotels,
with access through basement-level loading.

As a variant, the scheme also proposed a highly developed system of
"post officing," a method also worked out many years ago by Simon
Breines, a New York architect, in a proposal for a pedestrian midtown
New York. "Post officing" means a system of central sorting for all
freight and other deliveries within a zone. The sorted materials of
*all* kinds from *all* sources to each destination are then combined and
their distribution rationalized, much as incoming mail is sorted at a
post office and distributed. In this case, the point is to cut down
numbers of truck deliveries drastically; the reduced numbers of
deliveries (and dispatches) can then be made when few pedestrians are
around, preferably at night. The car-pedestrian separation, so far as
trucking is concerned, thus becomes principally a separation in time,
rather than in space. It involves considerable expense, because it
involves an extra step of materials handling.

Except in the most intensively used central downtown areas, it hardly
seems that the service complications accompanying thoroughgoing
separation of pedestrians and vehicles are justified.

I am doubtful as to whether the advantages of thoroughgoing separation
are, in any case, very great. The conflicts between pedestrians and
vehicles on city streets arise mainly from overwhelming numbers of,
vehicles, to which all but the most minimum pedestrian needs are
gradually and steadily sacrificed. The problem of vehicular dominance,
beyond toleration, is not exclusively []{#calibre_link-2108 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="347"}a problem involving automobiles. Obviously,
excessive numbers of horses produced similar conflicts; people who have
experienced an Amsterdam or New Delhi rush hour report that bicycles in
massive numbers become an appalling mixture with pedestrians.

Where opportunity affords, I have been watching how people use
pedestrian streets. They do not sally out in the middle and glory in
being kings of the road at last. They stay to the sides. In Boston,
which has experimented with closing two of its downtown shopping streets
(the deliveries were the knotty problem, of course), it was quite a
sight to see the almost empty roadbeds and the very crowded, very narrow
sidewalks. On the other side of the continent, the same phenomenon
occurs in the model Main Street of Disneyland. The only vehicles on the
Disneyland town's roadbed are a trolley which comes by at rather long
intervals, for kicks, and once in a while a horse and buggy.
Nevertheless, visitors there use the sidewalks in preference to walking
down the middle of the street; the only times I saw them choose the
street instead were, perversely, when one of the vehicles or a parade
went by. Then they went out to *join* what was in the street.

A certain amount of such inhibition in Boston or in Disneyland may be
caused by the fact that we have all been so conditioned to respect the
curbs. Paving which merged roadbed and sidewalk would probably induce
more pedestrian use of roadbed space; certainly, where sidewalks are
wide (even in Boston) people do not bunch themselves up to the laughable
degree that they do in Disneyland or on the narrow downtown Boston
sidewalks.

However, that is apparently only part of the answer. In suburban
shopping centers where "streets" are wide but thoroughly pedestrian and
without curbs, people stay to the sides also except where something
interesting to see has been deliberately placed out in the "street." It
takes tremendous numbers of pedestrians to populate the whole width of a
roadbed, even in scatterings. The only times pedestrians seem to use, or
want to use, a street roadbed in this fashion are in cases of
extraordinary floods of pedestrians, as in the Wall Street district or
the Boston financial area when the offices let out, or during the Easter
parade on Fifth Avenue. In more ordinary circumstances, people are
attracted to []{#calibre_link-2112 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="348"}the sides, I think, because that is where it is most
interesting. As they walk, they occupy themselves with seeing---seeing
in windows, seeing buildings, seeing each other.

In one respect, however, people on the pedestrian streets of Boston, of
Disneyland, or of shopping centers do behave differently from people on
ordinary city streets heavily used by vehicles. The exception is
significant. People cross over from one side to the other freely, and in
using this freedom they do not seem to be inhibited by the curbs. These
observations, coupled with the way people are forever sneaking across
streets at forbidden places if they can get away with it---even at risk
to their lives---and coupled with the palpable impatience people so
often exhibit at crossings, lead me to believe that the main virtue of
pedestrian streets is not that they completely lack cars, but rather
that they are not overwhelmed and dominated by floods of cars, and that
they are easy to cross.

Even for children the point may be less to segregate the cars than to
reduce the domination by cars and combat the erosion of sidewalk play
space by cars. It would, of course, be ideal to dispose of cars entirely
on city streets where children play; but worse troubles still are
harvested if this means disposing of the other utilitarian purposes of
sidewalks, and along with them, supervision. Sometimes such schemes,
too, are automatically self-canceling. A housing project in Cincinnati
affords an illustration. The houses in this project front on pedestrian
precincts of lawns and sidewalks, and they back up on service alleys for
cars and deliveries. All the casual coming and going occurs between the
houses and the alleys and therefore, functionally, the backs of the
houses have become the fronts and vice versa. Of course the alleys are
where the children all are too.

Life attracts life. Where pedestrian separation is undertaken as some
sort of abstract nicety and too many forms of life and activity go
unaccommodated or are suppressed to make the nicety work, the
arrangement goes unappreciated.

To think of city traffic problems in oversimplified terms of pedestrians
versus cars, and to fix on the segregation of each as a principal goal,
is to go at the problem from the wrong end. Consideration for
pedestrians in cities is inseparable from consideration
[]{#calibre_link-2117 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="349"}for city
diversity, vitality and concentration of use. In the absence of city
diversity, people in large settlements are probably better off in cars
than on foot. Unmanageable city vacuums are by no means preferable to
unmanageable city traffic.

The problem that lies behind consideration for pedestrians, as it lies
behind all other city traffic difficulties, is how to cut down absolute
numbers of surface vehicles and enable those that remain to work harder
and more efficiently. Too much dependence on private automobiles and
city concentration of use are incompatible. One or the other has to
give. In real life, this is what happens. Depending on which pressure
wins most of the victories, one of two processes occurs: erosion of
cities by automobiles, or attrition of automobiles by cities.

To understand the pros and cons of any city traffic tactics, we have to
understand the nature of these two processes, and their implications. We
also have to be aware that surface traffic in cities exerts pressures
upon *itself*. Vehicles compete with each other for space and for
convenience of their arrangements. They also compete with other uses for
space and convenience.

Erosion of cities by automobiles entails so familiar a series of events
that these hardly need describing. The erosion proceeds as a kind of
nibbling, small nibbles at first, but eventually hefty bites. Because of
vehicular congestion, a street is widened here, another is straightened
there, a wide avenue is converted to one-way flow, staggered-signal
systems are installed for faster movement, a bridge is double-decked as
its capacity is reached, an expressway is cut through yonder, and
finally whole webs of expressways. More and more land goes into parking,
to accommodate the ever increasing numbers of vehicles while they are
idle.

No one step in this process is, in itself, crucial. But cumulatively the
effect is enormous. And each step, while not crucial in itself, is
crucial in the sense that it not only adds its own bit to the total
change, but actually accelerates the process. Erosion of cities by
automobiles is thus an example of what is known as "positive feedback."
In cases of positive feedback, an action produces a reaction which in
turn intensifies the condition responsible []{#calibre_link-2123
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="350"}for the first action. This
intensifies the need for repeating the first action, which in turn
intensifies the reaction, and so on, ad infinitum. It is something like
the grip of a habit-forming addiction.

A striking statement of the positive feedback traffic process---or part
of it---was worked out by Victor Gruen in 1955, in connection with his
Fort Worth plan. Gruen, in order to understand the size of problem he
had in hand, began by calculating the potential business that Fort
Worth's currently underdeveloped and stagnating---but
traffic-jammed---downtown ought to be doing by 1970, based on its
projected population and trading area. He then translated this quantity
of economic activity into numbers of users, including workers, shoppers
and visitors for other purposes. Then, using the ratio of vehicles per
downtown users current in Fort Worth, he translated the putative future
users into numbers of vehicles. He then calculated how much street space
would be required to accommodate the numbers of these vehicles apt to be
on the streets at any one time.

He got an outlandish figure of roadbed needed: sixteen million square
feet, not including parking. This is in comparison with the five million
square feet of roadbed the underdeveloped downtown now possesses.

But the instant Gruen had calculated his sixteen million square feet,
the figure was already out of date and much too small. To obtain that
much roadbed space, the downtown would have to spread out physically to
an enormous extent. A given quantity of economic uses would thereby be
spread relatively thin. To use its different elements, people would have
to depend much less on walking and much more on driving. This would
further increase the need for still more street space, or else there
would be a terrible mess of congestion. Differing uses, necessarily
strung out in such relatively loose fashion, would be so far from one
another that it would become necessary to duplicate parking spaces
themselves, because uses bringing people at different hours would not be
sufficiently compact for much staggered use of the same
accommodations.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-142){#calibre_link-147 .calibre7}
This would mean spreading the downtown even []{#calibre_link-2127
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="351"}thinner, in turn requiring still
more use of cars, traveling greater absolute distances internally. Very
early in the process, public transportation would be thoroughly
inefficient, from both the customer's and the operator's point of view.
In short, there would be no coherent downtown, but a great, thin smear,
incapable of generating the metropolitan facilities, diversity and
choices theoretically possible for the population and economy concerned.

As Gruen pointed out here, the more space that is provided cars in
cities, the greater becomes the need for use of cars, and hence for
still more space for them.

In real life, we do not suddenly jump five million square feet of city
roadbed to sixteen million square feet, and so the implications of
accommodating a few more cars and a few more cars and a few more cars
are a little harder to see. But swiftly or slowly, the positive feedback
is at work. Swiftly or slowly, greater accessibility by car is
inexorably accompanied both by less convenience and efficiency of public
transportation, and by thinning-down and smearing-out of uses, and hence
by more need for cars.

The paradox of increasing car accessibility and decreasing intensity of
users can be seen at its extreme in Los Angeles, and to almost as great
a degree in Detroit. But the combination is just as inexorable in cities
at an earlier stage of the erosion process, where only a small minority
of users are accommodated by the increase in surface traffic flow.
Manhattan is a case in point. One method adopted there to palliate
vehicular congestion is to speed traffic by making the wide north-south
avenues one-way. Buses, instead of running both ways on an avenue, must,
of course, like the other vehicles, run north on one avenue, south on
another. This can, and often does, mean two long blocks of otherwise
unnecessary walking by bus users, in the course of reaching a given
destination.

Not surprisingly, when an avenue is made one-way in New York, a drop in
bus patronage follows. Where do these former []{#calibre_link-2132
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="352"}bus riders go? Nobody knows, but
the bus company's theory is that this fraction of its riders represents
persons on a borderline of choice. Some, the company officials think,
are on a borderline of choice as to whether to use buses or to use
individual vehicles; others, who have come into the district from
outside, are on a borderline of choice as to whether to make the effort
to use the district, and there may be other choices, such as not making
the internal trip. Whatever their choices, convenience differentials
have shifted sufficiently for these people to change their minds. What
is indisputable is that the increased traffic flow, with its by-the-way
depressing effect on public transportation, does bring into play an
increase in numbers of vehicles. It also cuts down pedestrian
convenience by forcing longer waits than formerly at crossings on the
affected avenues.

With one palliative and another, Manhattan enabled, during the
eight-year period 1948-56, 36 percent more vehicles to enter it daily
from outside, although this still represents a small fraction of
Manahattan's users from outside, 83 percent of whom arrive by public
transportation. During this same interval there was a 12-percent decline
in public transportation passengers from outside, leaving a "deficit" of
about 375,000 human users a day from outside. Increased city
accessibility by cars is *always* accompanied by declines in service of
public transportation. The declines in transit passengers are always
greater than increases in private automobile passengers. With greater
accessibility to a district by cars, total cross-use of the district by
people thus invariably declines, and this is a serious matter for
cities, where one of the great jobs of transportation is to permit and
encourage cross-use.

Results like this---increased accessibility, decreased intensity---stir
panic in certain breasts. To counter the drop in intensity of use, the
standard remedy is to try to increase further the accessibility by
cars---usually, first, by making parking easier for them. Thus, taking
another Manhattan example, one of the remedies fervently advocated by
the traffic commissioner, as a palliative for department stores, is a
series of city-owned parking garages. This palliative would erode some
ten blocks or so of midtown Manhattan land, including many hundreds of
small businesses.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-143){#calibre_link-148 .calibre7}

[]{#calibre_link-2136 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="353"}Thus does
erosion, little by little, subtract reasons for using an eroded
district, and at the same time make it less lively, less convenient,
less compact, less safe, for those who continue to have reason to use
it. The more concentrated and genuinely urban an area, the greater the
contrast between the smallness of what is delivered and the significance
of what is lost by the process of erosion.

If vehicular traffic in cities represented some fixed quantity of need,
then the action of providing for it would produce a satisfying and
fulfilling reaction. Something, at least, would be solved. But because
the need for more vehicles grows with the palliatives, the solution
keeps receding.

Even so, there should be at least a theoretical point of solution---a
point when increasing accessibility and decreasing intensity of use
reach a state of equilibrium or balance. At this point, the traffic
problem should be solved in the sense that there would be no more
pressure from vehicles unsatisfied for movement and storage room. With
progressive erosion, traffic pressures upon the various parts of a city
should be gradually equalized, and then the continued sprawl should
satisfy these equalized pressures. When a city has become a sufficiently
homogeneous and thin smear, it should have the traffic problem, at any
rate, in hand. Such a state of equilibrium is the only possible solution
to a positive feedback process like city erosion.

This point of equilibrium has not yet been approached in any American
city. Our real-life examples of big cities subjected to erosion
illustrate, as yet, only the stage of ever growing pressure. It
[]{#calibre_link-2140 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="354"}would seem
that Los Angeles ought to be approaching the point of equilibrium
because 95 percent of travel within Los Angeles is now done by private
automobile. Yet, even so, the pressures have not been sufficiently
equalized, for into Los Angeles' eroded and drab downtown 66 percent of
users still come by public transportation. When a strike of transit
workers in 1960 brought out more cars in Los Angeles than usual, air
photos showed freeways and surface roads alike jammed at crawling
bumper-to-bumper capacity, and news reports told of fist fights between
harried drivers competing for insufficient parking places. Los Angeles'
transit system, once considered the best in the United States (some
experts say in the world), has declined to a slow and inconvenient
vestige of public transportation, but it obviously still has a reservoir
of users for whom there is no room on the highways and parking lots.
Moreover, the parking pressure generally is still on the increase there.
A few years ago, two parking places per apartment were considered ample
for those moving back into the "city." Today the new apartment houses
are providing three parking places per apartment, one for the husband,
one for the wife, and an average of one per apartment for other
household members or visitors. No fewer will do in a city where it is
hard to buy a pack of cigarets without an automobile; and when someone
gives a party even an average allotment of three parking spaces per
apartment becomes a squeeze. Nor has the pressure been lifted yet for
cars in motion under normal, everyday conditions. As Harrison Salisbury
has written in the *New York Times:*

> Time and again, Los Angeles freeway movement is impeded by accidents.
> So chronic is the problem that the engineers propose to remove stalled
> cars from the highways by helicopter. The truth is that a horse and
> buggy could cross Los Angeles almost as fast in 1900 as an automobile
> can make this trip at 5 [P]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}. today.

The point of equilibrium, wherever it may lie, lies beyond the point
where problems even more serious than traffic bottlenecks are generated.
It lies beyond the point of safety from other human beings for persons
afoot upon streets. It lies beyond the point of casual city public life.
It lies far beyond the point of any relationship []{#calibre_link-2143
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="355"}between investment and
productivity. Quoting Salisbury again:

Los Angeles did not plan to cultivate such problems, any more than New
York and Boston and Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, eating themselves away
with expressways, are planning to chop up and eat themselves away. One
seemingly logical step is taken after another, each step plausible and
apparently defensible in itself; and the peculiar result is a form of
city which is not easier to use and to get around in, but on the
contrary more scattered, more cumbersome, more time wasting, expensive
and aggravating for cross-use. A New York manufacturer who makes many
business calls in other cities tells me he must devote almost twice as
much time in Los Angeles as in San Francisco or New York to achieve a
given number of calls and completed work. The head of a branch office of
a consulting firm in Los Angeles tells me he ought to have two more
staff members than are needed in Chicago, just to make an equivalent
number and range of contacts.

Yet although erosion solves nothing, and creates great inefficiency,
there is never a good or obvious point at which to swear off; for as the
process proceeds, from its small and apparently innocuous beginnings, it
becomes continually harder to halt or reverse it and seemingly, at
least, more impractical to do so.

The tactics of erosion, destructive as they are to cities, and poor as
they are at solving anything, cannot be blamed for all
[]{#calibre_link-2148 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="356"}that is
cumbersome and progressively impractical and expensive in city
transportation, however. Many city districts, without benefit of
erosion, are thin and impractical for use except by private automobiles
and always were---even before automobiles.

We are all familiar with the great need for automobiles in suburbs. It
is common for wives in suburbs to chalk up more errand mileage in a day
than their husbands chalk up in commuting mileage. Duplication of car
parking is also familiar in suburbs: the schools, the supermarkets, the
churches, the shopping centers, the clinics, the movie, all the
residences, must have their own parking lots and all this duplicate
parking lies idle for much of the time. Suburbs, at least while they
remain suburbs, can stand this land waste and this high ratio of private
automobile travel, because of their lack of concentration. (Here, it
would seem, is that elusive point of equilibrium; yet the moment work is
introduced into the mixture, even in a suburb, the equilibrium is lost.)

Much the same need, both for automobiles as a constant necessity and for
duplicated parking, can occur in cities where conditions for city
diversity---including sufficiently high densities---are lacking. "I am
the one who commutes in this family," explains my friend Mrs.
Kostritsky. The Kostritskys live in inner Baltimore, where they are
close to Mr. Kostritsky's work. But his wife, using a car (nothing else
is practical), must "commute" to get her children to school, to do any
shopping more extensive than that involving a loaf of bread, a can of
soup and a head of withered lettuce, to use a library, to see a show, to
attend meetings; and, like any mother already out in the suburbs, this
inner-city mother too must drive to a suburban shopping center to buy
children's clothing. Not only are there no such stores near her home,
but the downtown stores no longer have enough demand to carry a good
range of children's clothing. By dark it is dangerous to travel except
by car. The district's thinness, moreover, cannot justify tolerable
public transportation, either within the district itself or to other
parts of the city, and this would be so whether or not automobiles
existed.

Such city districts are like suburbs in requiring constant automobile
use. But, on the other hand, unlike suburbs, their concentration of
people is too high for suburban accommodation of all
[]{#calibre_link-2152 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="357"}the
automobiles and parking necessary. "In-between" densities---too low for
cities, too high for suburbs---are as impractical for transportation as
they are for other economic or social purposes.

The common fate of such districts nowadays is to be abandoned by people
with choice, in any case. If the very poor inherit them, the
transportation and use impracticalities may not cause serious traffic
problems, because the inhabitants may not be able to afford enough
traffic to make a problem. When they are able to, they are apt to leave.

But when such districts are purposely "renewed to bring back the middle
class," or if they are the objects of conservation, to retain a
population that has not yet deserted, the need to provide very extensive
car accommodations immediately becomes a chief and overriding
consideration. The existing deadness and thinness of use are thereby
reinforced.

The Great Blight of Dullness is allied with the blight of traffic
congestion.

The more territory, *planned or unplanned*, which is dull, the greater
becomes the pressure of traffic on lively districts. People who *have*
to use automobiles to use their dull home territory in a city, or to get
out of it, are not merely capricious when they take the cars to a
destination where the cars are unnecessary, destructive and a nuisance
to their own drivers.

Territories exhibiting the Great Blight of Dullness need to be supplied
with whatever conditions they lack for generating diversity. This is
their basic need, regardless of traffic. But it is an aim which becomes
impossible to further, if accommodations for huge numbers of cars get
first consideration, and other city uses get the leftovers. A strategy
of erosion by automobiles is thus not only destructive to such city
intensity as already exists; it also conflicts with nurturing new or
additional intensity of use where that is needed.

::: {#calibre_link-2158 .section_break}

:::

City uses and interests of various kinds are forever interfering with
the erosion process. One reason that erosion occurs as gradually as it
does in most cities is the exorbitant cost of buying up so much land
which is already in use for other purposes. But no end of other factors
besides expense exert friction on unlimited flow []{#calibre_link-2160
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="358"}of surface traffic. The many
corners where pedestrians are allowed to cross streets, for instance,
exert friction.

To get a sharp impression of the conflict that is waged between the
pressures for accommodating more vehicles and the pressures exerted by
many other uses, one need go no farther than the nearest public hearing
about a street widening, a route for a city expressway, a bridge
approach, a road in a park, a switch to one-way traffic, a new group of
public garages, or any other officially sponsored erosion proposal that
requires a hearing.

Such occasions bring forward a different viewpoint from that of the
erosion advocates. Citizens whose neighborhoods or property will be
affected usually turn up to combat the plan, sometimes protesting not
only with their voices and petitions, but with demonstrations and
signs.[\*^4^](#calibre_link-144){#calibre_link-149 .calibre7} They
sometimes cite much the same line of general argument against erosion
that I have touched on, quoting Salisbury or Gruen or Wilfred Owens'
book, *Cities in the Motor Age*, or Lewis Mumford's arguments for
balanced and varied transportation.

However, generalities and philosophy about whither the cities are
heading are not really the meat of the citizens' arguments, nor does
such comment make up their most fervent and convincing points.

What the citizens really attack is the *specific* destruction that will
be wrought on their homes, their streets, their businesses, their
community. Often their localized minor elected officials turn up to join
the protest; if they did not, they would never be elected again.

The planners, traffic commissioners, major elected officials, and other
remote people at the top of the municipal apparatus expect this
procedure. They know all about such protesters: well-meaning people but,
in the nature of things, untrained in these problems, concerned with
parochial interests, unable to see "the big picture."

But what these citizens say is worth listening to.

The very earthiness and directness of their reasoning about
[]{#calibre_link-2168 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="359"}concrete
and specific local effects is the key, I think, to rescuing cities from
destruction by traffic, a point I shall return to soon. It is also a
reminder that erosion is unpopular, for very tangible reasons, with
great numbers of city people.

While protests, the necessity for hearings themselves, and the direct
expenses required for many erosive changes all represent some of the
forms of friction exerted by cities on the erosion process, they do not
represent any reversal of the erosion process. At the most, they
represent stalemate.

If the triumph of other pressures over traffic is carried a step
further, however, so as to *diminish* vehicular traffic, then we have an
example of attrition of automobiles by cities.

Attrition of automobiles by cities is today almost always happenstance.
Attrition, unlike erosion, is seldom deliberately planned by anybody,
and it is neither recognized nor practiced as policy. Nevertheless, it
does occur.

Many of its occurrences are ephemeral. For instance, when an
off-Broadway theater was opened at the intersection of several narrow
streets in Greenwich Village, the added intensity of use at that spot,
between the acts and after the show, hampered traffic. The patrons used
the street roadbed as an outdoor lobby because the sidewalk was so
narrow, and they were slow to get out of the way. A similar blockage of
a much wider street can be seen in New York when Madison Square Garden
lets out after some event at night. So great is the press of the crowds
that they ignore the rights of vehicles. They do not respect the cars'
turns at the lights. Traffic halts and backs up for many blocks. In
either of these cases, if drivers on the borderline of choice decide not
to try to bring the car next time, attrition is operating, although very
ephemerally.

Another common form of attrition of automobiles by cities is represented
in the garment district of New York City which generates a great deal of
truck traffic. These trucks, in competition for road space, operate
inefficiently; their numbers are so great that they render inefficient
other forms of automobile traffic. People in private passenger cars
learn to avoid the garment district. When those on borderlines of choice
decide instead to walk or use the subway between their points of travel,
attrition is []{#calibre_link-2174 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="360"}operating. Indeed, so difficult has it become to move into
the garment district by taxi or private car that in recent years most of
Manhattan's fabric firms, which used to be in a quiet backwater in
downtown Manhattan, have moved up into the garment district where they
can be within walking distance of their customers. While such a move
adds to concentration and intensity of city land use, it cuts down on
city vehicular use, and is an example of attrition carried to the point
that the *need* for cars is reduced.

Attrition of automobiles by cities is so seldom deliberate that it is
hard to find recent examples. (The closing of streets for pedestrian
use, being almost always accompanied by compensating provisions for
vehicles, is not attrition but rearrangement of traffic.) However, the
closing of Washington Square Park in New York to automobiles, beginning
in 1958, affords an instance and is worth examining.

Washington Square Park, about seven acres in size, terminates the
southern end of Fifth Avenue. However, until 1958, it did not terminate
north-south traffic on Fifth Avenue. A roadway arrangement, originally a
carriage drive, carried traffic through the park between Fifth Avenue's
terminus and other north-south roadways below the park.

Over the years, traffic, of course, gradually increased on this park
roadway link and it was always a nuisance to other users who patronize
this park heavily and continuously. Back in the 1930's, Robert Moses, in
his capacity as parks commissioner, attempted to remove this road. But
his plan was to compensate for it---much more than compensate for
it---by trimming down the sides of the park to widen the narrow
perimeter streets, and thus to encircle the park with a major,
high-speed traffic artery. This scheme, locally christened "the bathmat
plan" (describing what would be left of the park) was fought and
defeated. Stalemate.

Then in the mid-1950's, Mr. Moses came up with a new plan for erosion.
This one involved a major depressed highway cutting through the center
of the park, as a link for carrying a heavy volume of high-speed traffic
between midtown Manhattan and a vast, yawning Radiant City and
expressway which Mr. Moses was cooking up south of the park.

At first most of the local citizens opposed the proposed depressed
[]{#calibre_link-2180 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="361"}highway,
anticipating nothing beyond a stalemate. However, two daring women, Mrs.
Shirley Hayes and Mrs. Edith Lyons, were less conventional in their
thinking. They took the remarkable intellectual step of envisioning
improvement for certain city uses, such as children's play, strolling,
and horsing around, at the expense of vehicular traffic. They advocated
eliminating the existing road, that is, closing the park to all
automobile traffic---but at the same time, *not* widening the perimeter
roads either. In short, they proposed closing off a roadbed without
compensating for it.

Their idea was popular; the advantages were evident to anyone who used
the park. Furthermore, it began to dawn on the theorists in the
community that stalemate did not exist as a choice this time. For when
other parts of the Moses Radiant City and Downtown Expressway scheme
were eventually developed, the road through the park would begin to get
automobiles in express-highway quantities. It was noticed that the old
road, although a nuisance, was being used well below its capacity, and
would be quite a different and intolerable affair when it carried a
share of the proposed future expressway-destined load.

Instead of staying on the defensive, majority opinion in the community
took to the offensive.

The city officials insisted that if the roadway were closed---a step
they appeared to think insane---the only possible alternatives must be
to widen the streets at the park perimeter, or else bring them to a
state of frantic and frenetic congestion. The Planning Commission, after
a hearing, turned down the proposals for closure, and approved instead
what its members called a "minimum roadway" through the park, on the
grounds that if the community got its foolish way the citizens would
regret it. The streets surrounding the park, they said, would be swamped
with diverted traffic. The traffic commissioner forecast an immediate
annual increase of millions of cars in the nearby streets. Mr. Moses
predicted that if the community got its way, the citizens would soon be
back begging him to reopen the road and build a highway, but the mess
they Were in would serve them right and teach them a lesson.

All these dire predictions would likely have come true if compensating
[]{#calibre_link-2185 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="362"}provision
had been made for cars diverted from the park. However, before any
alternate arrangements were made even arrangements for speed-up of flow
on existing perimeter roadbeds---the community, by exerting rather tough
political pressure abruptly, got the park road closed, first on a trial
basis and then permanently.

None of the predictions of increased traffic around the park were borne
out. These predictions could not be borne out because these perimeter
streets, narrow, beset with many lights, cluttered with parked cars,
whimsically used by jaywalkers, replete with hard-to-negotiate corners,
were already a most aggravating and slow route for automobiles. The
route through the park, the route that was being closed, was much the
best immediate north-south route.

Every traffic count taken around the park perimeter since the closing
has shown no increase in traffic; most counts have shown a slight
reduction. On lower Fifth Avenue, the traffic counts dropped
appreciably; apparently a considerable amount of its traffic had been
through traffic. Far from bringing new problems of congestion, the
obstacle resulted in slight relief of previous congestion.

Where have the traffic commissioner's annual millions of cars gone
instead?

This is the most interesting and significant part of the story. They
have not noticeably gone anywhere else instead. The through avenues east
and west of Fifth Avenue, and parallel to it, which might have been
expected to take the brunt of the diverted load, did not seem to receive
an extra load. At least the running time of the buses, a factor
sensitive to increases or decreases in total traffic, reflected no
change. Nor did the bus drivers detect a difference from observation.
(The traffic commissioner, who has the means for making counts of the
extent needed, and for doing origin-destination trip studies, appeared
uninterested in learning where, if anywhere, his vanished hordes
departed. He does not like to talk about it.)

Like the vanished bus riders on the one-way avenues, these cars---or
*some* cars---disappeared into thin air. Their disappearance is no more
mysterious, and no less to be expected, than the []{#calibre_link-2191
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="363"}disappearance of the bus riders.
For just as there is no absolute, immutable number of public
transportation riders in a city, so is there no absolute, immutable
number of private automobile riders; rather, the numbers vary in
response to current differentials in speed and convenience among ways of
getting around.

Attrition of automobiles operates by making conditions *less* convenient
for cars. Attrition as a steady, gradual process (something that does
not now exist) would steadily decrease the numbers of persons using
private automobiles in a city. If properly carried out---as one aspect
of stimulating diversity and intensifying city use---attrition would
decrease the need for cars simultaneously with decreasing convenience
for cars, much as, in reverse, erosion increases need for cars
simultaneously with increasing convenience for cars.

In real life, which is quite different from the life of dream cities,
attrition of automobiles by cities is probably the only means by which
absolute numbers of vehicles can be cut down. It is probably the only
realistic means by which better public transportation can be stimulated,
and greater intensity and vitality of city use be simultaneously
fostered and accommodated.

However, a strategy of attrition of automobiles by cities cannot be
arbitrary or negative. Nor is such a policy capable of giving dramatic
results suddenly. Although its cumulative effects should be
revolutionary, like any strategy aimed at keeping things working it has
to be engaged in as a form of evolution.

::: {#calibre_link-2195 .section_break}
---
:::

What sort of tactics are suitable to a strategy of attrition of
automobiles by cities? Many of the tactics become obvious at once, if we
understand that the point is not attrition of automobiles *in* cities
but rather the attrition of automobiles *by* cities. Tactics are
suitable which give room to other necessary and desired city uses that
happen to be in competition with automobile traffic needs.

Consider, for example, the problem of accommodating the sidewalk uses,
from outdoor store displays to children's play, that people attempt in
popular streets. These need broad sidewalks. In addition, double rows of
trees might be splendid on some sidewalks. An attrition tactician would
look for sidewalks []{#calibre_link-2198 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="364"}getting heavy or various use, and would seek to widen and
enhance them as a gain for city life. Automatically, this would narrow
the vehicular roadbed.

If and when our cities learn to foster deliberately the four basic
generators of diversity, popular and interesting streets will grow ever
more numerous. As soon as such streets, by their use, earn sidewalk
widening, it should be offered.

Where would the money come from? From the same place the money now comes
that is misapplied to sidewalk
narrowing.[\*^5^](#calibre_link-145){#calibre_link-150 .calibre7}

There are many variants to physical subtraction of roadbed space for the
benefit of other, already evident uses. Spots of intense congregation
outside schools, some theaters, certain store groupings, could be given
outdoor lobbies intruding partially into the vehicular roadbed, thus
making their attrition value permanent instead of ephemeral. Small parks
could be carried across a street, thereby creating dead ends. These
would still permit, from either direction, vehicular service access to a
street. But they would prevent vehicular through traffic except in
emergency. Park roads, where parks get enough use to justify this, could
be closed off as in Washington Square.

Aside from these and other variants of intrusion on roadbed space,
shorter blocks (and therefore many crossings) which are a necessity in
any case for generating diversity, also interfere with traffic flow.

In the next chapter, on visual order, I shall make further specific
suggestions for tactics that simultaneously are of positive benefit for
city life and happen to frustrate automobile traffic. Possibilities for
adding to convenience, intensity and cheer in cities, while
simultaneously hampering automobiles, are limitless. Today we
automatically, if sometimes regretfully, rule out most amenities---to
say nothing of pure functional necessities like easy and frequent
pedestrian crossings---because these are in conflict
[]{#calibre_link-2204 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="365"}with the
voracious and insatiable needs of automobiles. The conflict is real.
There is no need to invent tactics artificially.

Nor is there any need to foist such improvements where they are not
wanted. Streets and districts where appreciable numbers of people want
and will enjoy such changes should get them; not streets or districts
whose people will give them no support.

So close and so organic is the tie between vital, diverse city districts
and a reduction in absolute numbers of vehicles using their streets,
that, except for one serious problem, a good strategy of attrition could
be based purely on building lively, interesting city districts, and all
but ignoring the by-the-way effects on automobile traffic---which would
automatically be effects of attrition.

Attrition must come about with a certain selectivity. As mentioned
earlier in this chapter, traffic exerts pressures upon *itself;*
vehicles compete with each other, as well as with other uses. Just as
other uses and traffic adapt and adjust to each other, thus giving rise
to the processes of erosion or attrition, so do vehicles adapt and
adjust to the presence of each other. For instance, the inefficiency of
trucks in cities is, in large part, an adaptation by trucks to the
competition of so many vehicles. If the inefficiency becomes
sufficiently great, the enterprises concerned may move or go out of
business, which is another aspect of erosion and thinning down in
cities. I have already given an example of differential convenience
among vehicles themselves: the differing effects upon private
automobiles and upon buses of making an avenue one-way. The advantage to
the automobiles is a penalty to the buses.

Utterly unselective attrition of vehicles could be, in many streets, as
discouraging to trucks and to buses as to private automobiles.

Trucks and buses are themselves important manifestations of city
intensity and concentration. And as I shall soon indicate, if their
efficiency is encouraged, this too results in further attrition of
automobiles, as a side effect.

I am indebted for this line of thought to William McGrath, traffic
commissioner of New Haven, who has conceived several means by which
already familiar traffic techniques can be used []{#calibre_link-2211
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="366"}deliberately for selective
vehicular encouragement and discouragement. The very idea of doing such
a thing at all is brilliant; McGrath says it occurred to him gradually,
over a period of four years of working with New Haven planners, during
which he realized that techniques for moving and storing more cars and
for putting every foot of roadbed to maximum use, as he learned in
school, was a most lopsided way of dealing with city streets.

One of McGrath's aims is to encourage greater efficiency of public
transportation, which in New Haven today means buses. To achieve this,
the buses going into and through downtown must be speeded up. This can
be done without doubt, says McGrath, by regulating the traffic light
frequencies to short intervals and not staggering them. Owing to the
corner pick-up stops required in any case by buses, the short signal
frequencies interfere with bus travel time less than long signal
frequencies. These same shorter frequencies, unstaggered, constantly
hold up and slow down private transportation, which would thereby be
discouraged from using these particular streets. In turn, this would
mean still less interference and more speed for buses.

McGrath thinks that the realistic way to get pedestrian streets where
these may be desirable in a heavily used downtown is to bollix up the
use of the street for cars---largely by bollixing up the signal
system---to the point that "only a driver with a hole in his head would
pick such a route after he tried it a time or two," and also by
forbidding parking and standing. After such a street has reached the
point that it is being used only by trucks making or picking up
deliveries there, and by few other vehicles, its status as a pedestrian
street can be formalized without much jolt to anybody and without the
necessity to compensate by throwing heavy flow and burdensome parking
upon some other street. The necessary changes in habits will already
have been absorbed, by attrition.

Theoretically, city expressways are always presented as means for taking
cars off of other streets, and thereby relieving city streets of
traffic. In real life, this works only if and when the expressways are
well under capacity use; left unconsidered is the eventual destination,
off the expressway, of that increased flow of vehicles. Instead of
serving as bypassers, expressways in cities []{#calibre_link-2215
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="367"}serve too frequently as dumpers.
Mr. Moses' proposed plan for a downtown expressway in Manhattan, for
instance---the one with repercussions on Washington Square---is always
presented appealingly as a fast route between the East River bridges and
the Hudson River tunnels to keep through traffic out of the city. And
yet the actual plan for it includes a spaghetti-dish of ramps into the
city. It will be a dumper, and by thus accommodating traffic aimed for
the heart of the city, it will actually tend to choke up, instead of
aid, city bypass traffic.

McGrath thinks that if expressways are genuinely meant to relieve city
streets, their full effects must be taken into account. There must, for
one thing, be no increased parking to be reached through city streets
that are theoretically supposed to be relieved of cars. Nor should it be
possible at exit ramps, McGrath believes, for drivers to thread their
way through theoretically relieved streets. McGrath works this out as
follows: Streets that could possibly be used as alternates to the artery
when the artery chokes up, should be protected by judiciously placed
dead ends; these would not interfere with localized use of streets but
would thoroughly thwart drivers trying to knit them with expressway or
arterial routes. With such devices, expressways could serve as bypass
routes only.

Certain ramps, which do lead into dense cities, could be limited to
trucks and buses.

Extending the basic McGrath idea of selectivity further, trucks in
cities could be greatly helped. Trucks are vital to cities. They mean
service. They mean jobs. At present, we already have, in reverse, truck
selectivity traffic tactics on a few city streets. On Fifth and Park
avenues in New York, for instance, trucks are forbidden, except for
those making deliveries.

This is a reasonable policy for some streets, but under a strategy of
attrition of automobiles, the same tactics can be used wrong-side-out on
other streets. Thus, where streets are narrowed or bottlenecked to the
point that a choice must be made as to what vehicles can use them,
precedence can go to trucks, with other vehicles permitted only if
*they* are making (passenger) deliveries or pickups.

Meantime, the fastest lanes in multilane arteries or on wide
[]{#calibre_link-2221 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="368"}avenues
could be reserved for trucks only. This is no more than a reversal, for
example, of the amazingly frivolous New York policy of designing the
speediest expressway arteries, along the densest parts of the city,
deliberately to exclude trucks, and forcing even long-distance trucking
into local streets.

Trucks, favored by selective attrition, would do considerable
self-sorting. Long-haul vehicles would, in the main, use fast arteries.
Narrow or bottlenecked streets would be used primarily for deliveries or
pickups.

In a city district where attrition of automobiles had steadily and
selectively occurred, we could expect to find trucks forming a much
higher proportion of total surface vehicles than is the case today. This
does not mean there would be more trucks, but rather fewer passenger
automobiles; the more effective the attrition on private cars, the less
ubiquitous we might expect the trucks to be, because they would not be
halted and idled to the extent they are now. Furthermore, trucks which
are used *for* work, instead of for getting to and from work, spread out
their use through the working day instead of piling up in wild peaks.

As between taxis and private passenger automobiles, inadequate parking
selectively favors taxis. This can be a useful form of traffic
selectivity too, because taxis do so many more times the work of
equivalent private cars. Khrushchev, when he visited this country,
understood this differential in efficiency very quickly. After watching
the traffic in San Francisco, he commented to the mayor in wonder at the
waste, and evidently thought over what he had seen, because when he
reached Vladivostok on his way home he announced that it would be his
policy to encourage fleets of taxis in Soviet cities rather than private
automobiles.

Selectivity, which would have to be part of a successful strategy of
attrition wherever the competition among vehicles warranted it, means
very little, however, by itself. It has point only as part of a broad
strategy of cutting down absolute numbers of vehicles in cities.

In considering suitable tactics and principles of attrition, it is worth
taking another look at the process of erosion. Erosion of cities by
automobiles, while anything but admirable in its effects,
[]{#calibre_link-2228 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="369"}presents
much to admire in certain of its principles of operation. Anything so
effective has something to teach, and is worth respect and study from
that point of view.

The changes required or wrought by erosion always occur piecemeal---so
much so that we can almost call them insidious. In the perspective of a
city's life as a whole, even the most drastic steps in the process are
piecemeal changes. *Therefore*, *each change is absorbed piecemeal, as
it occurs*. Each erosive change requires changes in the habits which
people follow to get around in a city, and changes in the ways that they
use a city, but not everybody needs to change his habits at once, nor
does anybody (except those displaced) have to change too many habits at
once.

Attrition of automobiles requires changes in habits and adjustments in
usage too; just as in the case of erosion it should not disrupt too many
habits at once.

The desirability of piecemeal, evolutionary attrition has a bearing,
too, on the development of public transportation. At present public
transportation languishes, but not from lack of potential technical
improvement. A wealth of ingenious technique lies in limbo because there
is no point in developing it during an era of city erosion, no funds for
it, no faith in it. Even if public transportation is stimulated by
increase in usage, under tactics of automobile attrition, it is
unrealistic to expect that revolutionary improvement will be
accomplished abruptly, or wished into being. The development of
twentieth-century public transportation (something we have never
possessed) has to follow a rise in custom and clearly anticipated
custom, just as decline in public transportation has followed a drop in
custom and anticipated drop in custom.

The piecemeal erosive changes that cumulatively eat away a city are by
no means all thought out in advance, in some Olympian scheme or master
plan. If they were, they would not be nearly as effective as they are.
In the main, they occur as direct, practical responses to direct,
practical problems as those problems appear. Every move thus counts; few
are gestures and boondoggles. In the case of attrition of automobiles,
this same kind of opportunism will give maximum results, and also best
results in terms of city utility and improvement. Attrition tactics
should be applied where []{#calibre_link-2233 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="370"}conflicts exist between traffic flow and other city uses,
and as new conflicts of this kind develop.

Finally, city eroders always approach the problems to be solved in
positive fashion. There is some talk, mostly on rarefied and abstract
levels, about using highways for the side *purpose* of slum clearance.
But in real life, nobody either promotes or supports highways with the
negative *purpose* of getting rid of something else. Increased, or
supposedly increased, convenience, speed or access are the purposes.

Attrition, too, must operate in positive terms, as a means of supplying
positive, easily understood and desired improvements, appealing to
various specific and tangible city interests. This is desirable not
because such an approach is a superior persuasive and political device
(although it is), but because the objects should be the tangible and
positive objects of increasing, in specific places, city diversity,
vitality and workability. To concentrate on riddance as the primary
purpose, negatively to put taboos and penalties on automobiles as
children might say, "Cars, cars, go away," would be a policy not only
doomed to defeat but rightly doomed to defeat. A city vacuum, we must
remember, is not superior to redundant traffic, and people are rightly
suspicious of programs that give them nothing for something.

:::

What if we fail to stop the erosion of cities by automobiles? What if we
are prevented from catalyzing workable and vital cities because the
practical steps needed to do so are in conflict with the practical steps
demanded by erosion?

There is a silver lining to everything.

In that case we Americans will hardly need to ponder a mystery that has
troubled men for millennia: What is the purpose of life? For us, the
answer will be clear, established and for all practical purposes
indisputable: The purpose of life is to produce and consume automobiles.

It is not hard to understand that the producing and consuming of
automobiles might properly seem the purpose of life to the General
Motors management, or that it might seem so to other men and women
deeply committed economically or emotionally to this pursuit. If they so
regard it, they should be commended []{#calibre_link-2241 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="371"}rather than criticized for this remarkable
identification of philosophy with daily duty. It is harder to
understand, however, why the production and consumption of automobiles
should be the purpose of life for this country.

Similarly, it is understandable that men who were young in the 1920's
were captivated by the vision of the freeway Radiant City, with the
specious promise that it would be appropriate to an automobile age. At
least it was then a new idea; to men of the generation of New York's
Robert Moses, for example, it was radical and exciting in the days when
their minds were growing and their ideas forming. Some men tend to cling
to old intellectual excitements, just as some belles, when they are old
ladies, still cling to the fashions and coiffures of their exciting
youth. But it is harder to understand why this form of arrested mental
development should be passed on intact to succeeding generations of
planners and designers. It is disturbing to think that men who are young
today, men who are being trained now for their careers, should accept
*on the grounds that they must he* "*modern*" *in their thinking*,
conceptions about cities and traffic which are not only unworkable, but
also to which nothing new of any significance has been added since their
fathers were children.

# Visual order: its limitations and possibilities {#calibre_link-2248 .chaphead1}
:::

When we deal with cities we are dealing with life at its most complex
and intense. Because this is so, there is a basic esthetic limitation on
what can be done with cities: *A city cannot be a work of art*.

We need art, in the arrangements of cities as well as in the other
realms of life, to help explain life to us, to show us meanings, to
illuminate the relationship between the life that each of us embodies
and the life outside us. We need art most, perhaps, to reassure us of
our own humanity. However, although art and life are interwoven, they
are not the same things. Confusion between them is, in part, why efforts
at city design are so disappointing. It is important, in arriving at
better design strategies and tactics, to clear up this confusion.

Art has its own peculiar forms of order, and they are rigorous. Artists,
whatever their medium, *make selections* from the abounding materials of
life, and organize these selections into works that
[]{#calibre_link-2252 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="373"}are under
the control of the artist. To be sure, the artist has a sense that the
demands of the work (i.e., of the selections of material he has made)
control him. The rather miraculous result of this process---if the
selectivity, the organization and the control are consistent within
themselves---can be art. But the essence of this process is disciplined,
highly discriminatory selectivity *from* life. In relation to the
inclusiveness and the literally endless intricacy of life, art is
arbitrary, symbolic and abstracted. That is its value and the source of
its own kind of order and coherence.

To approach a city, or even a city neighborhood, as if it were a larger
architectural problem, capable of being given order by converting it
into a disciplined work of art, is to make the mistake of attempting to
substitute art for life.

The results of such profound confusion between art and life are neither
life nor art. They are taxidermy. In its place, taxidermy can be a
useful and decent craft. However, it goes too far when the specimens put
on display are exhibitions of dead, stuffed cities.

Like all attempts at art which get far away from the truth and which
lose respect for what they deal with, this craft of city taxidermy
becomes, in the hands of its master practitioners, continually more
picky and precious. This is the only form of advance possible to it.

All this is a life-killing (and art-killing) misuse of art. The results
impoverish life instead of enriching it.

To be sure, it is possible for the creation of art not to be so
individualistic a process as it usually is in our society.

Under certain circumstances, the creation of art can apparently be done
by general, and in effect anonymous, consensus. For instance, in a
closed society, a technologically hampered society, or an arrested
society, either hard necessity or tradition and custom can enforce on
everyone a disciplined selectivity of purposes and materials, a
discipline by consensus on what those materials demand of their
organizers, and a disciplined control over the forms thereby created.
Such societies can produce villages, and maybe even their own kinds of
cities, which look to us like works of art in their physical totality.

But this is not the case with us. For us, such societies may be
[]{#calibre_link-2260 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="374"}interesting
to ponder; and we may regard their harmonious works with admiration or a
kind of nostalgia, and wonder wistfully why we can't be like that.

We can't be like that because the limitations on possibilities and the
strictures on individuals in such societies extend much beyond the
materials and conceptions used in creating works of art from the grist
of everyday life. The limitations and strictures extend into every realm
of opportunity (including intellectual opportunity) and into
relationships among people themselves. These limitations and strictures
would seem to us an unnecessary and intolerable stultification of life.
For all our conformity, we are too adventurous, inquisitive, egoistic
and competitive to be a harmonious society of artists by consensus, and,
what is more, we place a high value upon the very traits that prevent us
from being so. Nor is this the constructive use we make of cities or the
reason we find them valuable: to embody tradition or to express (and
freeze) harmonious consensus.

Nineteenth-century Utopians, with their rejection of urbanized society,
and with their inheritance of eighteenth-century romanticism about the
nobility and simplicity of "natural" or primitive man, were much
attracted to the idea of simple environments that were works of art by
harmonious consensus. To get back to this condition has been one of the
hopes incorporated in our tradition of Utopian reform.

This futile (and deeply reactionary) hope tinctured the Utopianism of
the Garden City planning movement too and, at least ideologically,
somewhat gentled its more dominant theme of harmony and order imposed
and frozen by authoritarian planning.

The hope for an eventual, simple environment formed of art by
consensus---or rather, a ghostly vestige of that hope---has continued to
flit through Garden City planning theory when it has kept itself pure
from Radiant City and City Beautiful planning. Thus, as late as the
1930's, Lewis Mumford in *The Culture of Cities* gave an importance,
which would be puzzling indeed in the absence of this tradition, to
pursuits like basket weaving, pottery making and blacksmithing in the
planned communities he envisioned for us. As late as the 1950's,
Clarence Stein, the leading []{#calibre_link-2265 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="375"}American Garden City planner, on the
occasion of receiving the American Institute of Architects' gold medal
for his contributions to architectural progress, was casting about for
some object which might suitably be created by harmonious consensus in
the ideal communities he envisioned. He suggested that citizens could be
allowed to build a nursery school, of course with their own hands. But
the gist of Stein's message was that, aside from the conceded nursery
school, the complete physical environment of a community and all the
arrangements that comprise it must be in the total, absolute and
unchallenged control of the project's architects.

This is, of course, no different from the Radiant City and City
Beautiful assumptions. These always were primarily architectural design
cults, rather than cults of social reform.

Indirectly through the Utopian tradition, and directly through the more
realistic doctrine of art by imposition, modern city planning has been
burdened from its beginnings with the unsuitable aim of converting
cities into disciplined works of art.

Like the housers who face a blank if they try to think what to do
besides income-sorting projects, or the highwaymen who face a blank if
they try to think what to do besides accommodate more cars, just so,
architects who venture into city design often face a blank in trying to
create visual order in cities except by substituting the order of art
for the very different order of life. They cannot do anything else much.
They cannot develop alternate tactics, for they lack a strategy for
design that will help cities.

::: {#calibre_link-2269 .section_break}
---
:::

Instead of attempting to substitute art for life, city designers should
return to a strategy ennobling both to art and to life: a strategy of
illuminating and clarifying life and helping to explain to us its
meanings and order---in this case, helping to illuminate, clarify and
explain the order of cities.

We are constantly being told simple-minded lies about order in cities,
talked down to in effect, assured that duplication represents order. It
is the easiest thing in the world to seize hold of a few forms, give
them a regimented regularity, and try to palm []{#calibre_link-2272
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="376"}this off in the name of order.
However, simple regimented regularity and significant systems of
functional order are seldom coincident in this world.

To see complex systems of functional order as order, and not as chaos,
takes understanding. The leaves dropping from the trees in the autumn,
the interior of an airplane engine, the entrails of a dissected rabbit,
the city desk of a newspaper, all appear to be chaos if they are seen
without comprehension. Once they are understood as systems of order,
they actually *look* different.

Because we use cities, and therefore have experience with them, most of
us already possess a good groundwork for understanding and appreciating
their order. Some of our trouble in comprehending it, and much of the
unpleasant chaotic effect, comes from lack of enough visual
reinforcements to underscore the functional order, and, worse still,
from unnecessary visual contradictions.

It is fruitless, however, to search for some dramatic key element or
kingpin which, if made clear, will clarify all. No single element in a
city is, in truth, the kingpin or the key. The mixture itself is
kingpin, and its mutual support is the order.

When city designers and planners try to find a design device that will
express, in clear and easy fashion, the "skeleton" of city structure
(expressways and promenades are current favorites for this purpose),
they are on fundamentally the wrong track. A city is not put together
like a mammal or a steel frame building---or even like a honeycomb or a
coral. A city's very *structure* consists of mixture of uses, and we get
closest to its structural secrets when we deal with the conditions that
generate diversity.

Being a structural system in its own right, a city can best be
understood straightforwardly in its own terms, rather than in terms of
some other kinds of organisms or objects. However, if the slippery
shorthand of analogy can help, perhaps the best analogy is to imagine a
large field in darkness. In the field, many fires are burning. They are
of many sizes, some great, others small; some far apart, others dotted
close together; some are brightening, some are slowly going out. Each
fire, large or small, extends its radiance into the surrounding murk,
and thus it carves out a space. But the space and the shape of that
space exist only to the extent that the light from the fire creates it.

[]{#calibre_link-2279 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="377"}The murk
has no shape or pattern except where it is carved into space by the
light. Where the murk between the lights becomes deep and undefinable
and shapeless, the only way to give it form or structure is to kindle
new fires in the murk or sufficiently enlarge the nearest existing
fires.

Only intricacy and vitality of use give, to the parts of a city,
appropriate structure and shape. Kevin Lynch, in his book *The Image of
the City*, mentions the phenomenon of "lost" areas, places that the
people he interviewed completely ignored and were actually unaware of
unless reminded, although it would seem the locations of these "lost"
places by no means merited this oblivion, and sometimes his observers
had just traversed them in actuality or in
imagination.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-151){#calibre_link-155 .calibre7}

Wherever the fires of use and vitality fail to extend in a city is a
place in the murk, a place essentially without city form and structure.
Without that vital light, no seeking for "skeletons" or "frameworks" or
"cells" on which to hang the place can bring it into a city form.

These metaphoric space-defining fires are formed---to get back to
tangible realities---by areas where diverse city uses and users give
each other close-grained and lively support.

This is the essential order which city design can assist. These areas of
vitality need to have their remarkable functional order clarified. As
cities get more such areas, and less gray area or murk, the need and the
opportunities for clarification of this order will increase.

Whatever is done to clarify this order, this intricate life, has to be
done mainly by tactics of emphasis and suggestion.

Suggestion---the part standing for the whole---is a principal means by
which art communicates; this is why art often tells us so much with such
economy. One reason we understand this communication
[]{#calibre_link-2286 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="378"}of
suggestion and symbol is that, to a certain extent, it is the way all of
us see life and the world. We constantly make organized selections of
what we consider relevant and consistent from among all the things that
cross our senses. We discard, or tuck into some secondary awareness, the
impressions that do not make sense for our purposes of the
moment---unless those irrelevant impressions are too strong to ignore.
Depending on our purposes, we even vary our selections of what we take
in and organize. To this extent, we are all artists.

This attribute of art, and this attribute in the way we see, are
qualities on which the practice of city design can bank and which it can
turn to advantage.

Designers do not need to be in literal control of an entire field of
vision to incorporate visual order in cities. Art is seldom ploddingly
literal, and if it is, it is poor stuff. Literal visual control in
cities is usually a bore to everybody but the designers in charge, and
sometimes after it is done, it bores them too. It leaves no discovery or
organization or interest for anybody else.

The tactics needed are suggestions that help people make, for
themselves, order and sense, instead of chaos, from what they see.

Streets provide the principal visual scenes in cities.

However, too many streets present our eyes with a profound and confusing
contradiction. In the foreground, they show us all kinds of detail and
activity. They make a visual announcement (very useful to us for
understanding the order of cities) that this is an intense life and that
into its composition go many different things. They make this
announcement to us not only because we may see considerable activity
itself, but because we see, in different types of buildings, signs,
store fronts or other enterprises or institutions, and so on, the
inanimate evidences of activity and diversity. However, if such a street
goes on and on into the distance, with the intensity and intricacy of
the foreground apparently dribbling into endless amorphous repetitions
of itself and finally petering into the utter anonymity of distance, we
are also getting a visual announcement that clearly says endlessness.

In terms of all human experience, these two announcements,
[]{#calibre_link-2294 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="379"}one telling
of great intensity, the other telling of endlessness, are hard to
combine into a sensible whole.

One or the other of these two conflicting sets of impressions has to
take precedence. The viewer has to combat or try to suppress the other
set of impressions. Either way, it is difficult not to sense confusion
and disorder. The more lively and varied the foreground (that is, the
better its innate order of diversity), the sharper, and therefore the
more disturbing, the contradiction of the two announcements can be. If
too many streets embody this conflict, if they stamp a district or a
whole city with this equivocation, the general effect is bound to be
chaotic.

There are, of course, two ways of trying to see such a street. If a
person gives the long view precedence, with its connotations of
repetition and infinity, then the close-up scene and the intensity it
conveys seem superfluous and offensive. I think this is the way that
many architecturally trained viewers see city streets, and this is one
reason for the impatience, and even contempt, that many (not all) of
those who are architecturally trained express for the physical evidences
of city diversity, freedom and life.

If the foreground view, on the other hand, takes precedence, then the
endless repetition and continuation into lost, indefinite distances
becomes the superfluous, offensive and senseless element. I think this
is the way most of us look at city streets most of the time, because
this is the viewpoint of a person whose purpose it is to use what exists
on that street, rather than to look at it in detachment. Looking at the
street in this way, the viewer makes sense, and at least a minimum
amount of order, from the intimate view, but only at the price of
considering the distance as a deplorable mishmash, better dismissed from
mind if possible.

To bring even a chance for visual order to most such streets---and to
districts in which such streets predominate---this basic contradiction
of strong visual impressions has to be dealt with. I think this is what
European visitors are getting at when they remark, as they often do,
that the ugliness of our cities is owing to our gridiron street systems.

The functional order of the city demands that the intensity and
diversity be there; their evidences can be removed from the street only
at the cost of destroying necessary functional order.
[]{#calibre_link-2300 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="380"}On the
other hand, however, the order of the city does not demand the
impression of endlessness; this impression can be minimized without
interfering with functional order. Indeed, by so doing, the really
significant attribute of intensity is reinforced.

Therefore a good many city streets (not all) need visual interruptions,
cutting off the indefinite distant view and at the same time visually
heightening and celebrating intense street use by giving it a hint of
enclosure and entity.

Old parts of our cities which have irregular street patterns frequently
do this. However, they have the disadvantage of being difficult to
understand as street systems; people easily get lost in them and have a
difficult time keeping them mapped out in their heads.

Where the basic street pattern is a gridiron plan, which has many
advantages, there are two main ways, nevertheless, of introducing
sufficient visual irregularities and interruptions into the city scene.

The first means is by adding additional streets where the streets of the
gridiron plan are too far apart from each other---as on the West Side of
Manhattan, for example: in short, where additional streets are necessary
in any case for the functional purpose of helping to generate diversity.

If such new streets are added economically, with a decent respect and
restraint for saving the most valuable, the most handsome, or the most
various among buildings that lie in their potential paths, and also with
the aim of incorporating sides or rears of existing buildings into their
frontages wherever possible, to give a mixture of age, then these new
streets are seldom going to be straight for great length. They are going
to have bends in them and sometimes a considerable tangent. Even a
straight street cutting one former large block into two small blocks
will not likely form a continuous straight line with its extensions
through the next block and the next and next, indefinitely. There are
certain to be T junctures where these offset street segments meet
intersecting streets at right angles. Ordinary prudence and respect for
city variety, combined with an awareness that irregularity in these
cases is an advantage in itself, can determine the best of various
potential alternative paths for new extra streets. The least
[]{#calibre_link-2306 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="381"}material
destruction should be combined with maximum visual gain; these two aims
are not in conflict.

Subsidiary irregularity within a dominant grid system is not difficult
to understand. Extra streets like these, introduced in between the grid
streets, could even be named in recognition of their relationship to the
grid.

The combination of a basic, easily understandable grid system, together
with purposely irregular streets dropped in where the grid is too large
for good city functioning, could be, I think, a distinctive and most
valuable American contribution to the tactics of city design.

The second means for introducing irregularities and visual interruptions
where they are insufficient, is on grid streets themselves.

San Francisco is a city with many natural visual interruptions in a
gridiron street pattern. San Francisco's streets, in general, are
regular gridiron arrangements in two-dimensional plan; however, in
three-dimensional topography they are masterpieces of visual
interruption. The many and abrupt hills constantly make separations
between the nearby scene and the distance, and this is true whether one
is looking along a street toward a rise, or looking down a slope. This
arrangement greatly emphasizes the intimate and immediate street scenes,
without sacrificing the clarity of gridiron organization.

Cities without such topography cannot reproduce any such happy accident
by natural means. However, they too can introduce visual interruptions
into straight and regular street patterns without sacrificing clarity of
organization and movement. Bridges that connect two buildings up above a
street sometimes do this service; so do buildings which themselves
bridge a street. Occasional large buildings (preferably with public
significance) can be placed across straight streets at ground level
Grand Central Terminal in New York is a well-known
example.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-152){#calibre_link-156 .calibre7}

[]{#calibre_link-2313 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="382"}Straight,
"endless" streets can be interrupted and the street itself divided
around a square or plaza forming the interruption; this square can be
occupied by a building. In cases where vehicular traffic can actually be
dead-ended on straight streets, small parks could be thrown across from
sidewalk to sidewalk; the visual interruption or diversion would be
provided here by groves of trees or by small (and, let us hope,
cheerful) park structures.

In still other cases, a visual diversion need not extend across a
straight street, but can be in the form of a building or group of
buildings set forward from the normal building line to make a jog, with
the sidewalk cut underneath. Another form of jog is a plaza at one side
of the street, which makes the building beyond stand out as a visual
interruption.

It might be supposed that all this visual emphasis on intensity of
street use would be rather overwhelming or even inhuman. But this is not
so. Districts with many visual street interruptions do not, in real
life, tend to intimidate or overwhelm people; they are more apt to be
characterized as "friendly" and also to be comprehensible as districts.
After all, this is intensity of human life which is being acknowledged
and emphasized and, what is more, emphasized in its understandable,
close-up aspect. It is city infinity and repetition which generally seem
overwhelming, inhuman and incomprehensible.

There can be pitfalls, however, in the use of visual street
interruptions.

First, there is little point in using them where there is no visual tale
of street intensity and detail to tell. If a street is, in truth, a long
repetition of one kind of use, providing thin activity, then visual
interruption does not clarify the existing form of order here. Visual
enclosure of practically nothing (in terms of city intensity) can hardly
be more than a design affectation. Visual interruptions and vistas will
not, in themselves, *bring* city vitality and intensity or their
accompaniments of safety, interest, casual public life and economic
opportunity. Only the four basic generators of diversity can do that.

Second, it is unnecessary, and would even become boring in its own way,
for all city streets to have visual interruptions. After all a big city
is a big place, and there is nothing wrong in acknowledging
[]{#calibre_link-2319 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="383"}or stating
this fact too from time to time. (Another of the advantages of San
Francisco's hills, for instance, is that the views from them do
precisely this, and they do it at the same time as they are separating
the distance from the immediate street view.) Occasional endlessness, or
else focal endings far in the distance on streets, lend variety. Some
streets that run into borders such as bodies of water, campuses or large
sports grounds should be left without visual interruptions. Not every
street that terminates in a border need reveal this fact, but some of
them should, both to introduce distant glimpses of what is different,
and to convey casual messages about the whereabouts of the border---a
form of orientation clue, incidentally, that Lynch found very important
to the people he interviewed for his study of city "imageability."

Third, visual street interruptions should be, in functional terms, not
dead ends, but "corners." Actual physical cut-offs to foot traffic in
particular are destructive in cities. There should always be a way
around the visual interruption or through it, a way that is obvious as a
person reaches it, and that then lays out before the eyes a new street
scene. This seductive attribute of designed interruptions to the eye was
summed up neatly by the late architect Eliel Saarinen, who is reported
to have said, in explaining his own design premises, "There must always
be an end in view, and the end must not be final."

Fourth, visual interruptions get their force partially from being
exceptions to the rule. Too many of the same kind can cancel themselves
out. For instance, if plazas along the side of a street are plentiful,
the street disintegrates visually as a street, to say nothing of going
dead functionally. Jogs with arcades beneath, if they are plentiful
instead of exceptional, just give us a narrower street and can even
become claustrophobic in their effect.

Fifth, a visual street interruption is a natural eye-catcher and its own
character has much to do with the impressions made by the entire scene.
If it is banal, vacuous or merely messy, it might better not exist. A
gas station or a bunch of billboards or a vacant and neglected building
in such a place casts a pall out of all proportion to its size. A visual
street interruption which is also beautiful is great luck, but when we
go after beauty too solemnly in cities we usually seem to end up with
pomposity. Beauty is not []{#calibre_link-2323 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="384"}around for the asking, but we can ask that
visual interruptions be decent and even interesting.

Landmarks, as their name says, are prime orientation clues. But good
landmarks in cities also perform two other services in clarifying the
order of cities. First, they emphasize (and also dignify) the diversity
of cities; they do this by calling attention to the fact that they are
different from their neighbors, and important because they are
different. This explicit statement about themselves carries an implicit
statement about the composition and order of cities. Second, in certain
instances landmarks can make important to our eyes city areas which are
important in functional fact but need to have that fact visually
acknowledged and dignified.

By understanding these other services, we can understand why many
different uses are eligible and useful as city landmarks, depending on
their contexts in the city.

Let us first consider the role of landmarks as announcers and dignifiers
of diversity. One reason a landmark can be a landmark is, of course,
that it is in a spot where it shows to advantage. But in addition, it is
necessary that the landmark be distinctive as a thing itself, and it is
this point with which we are now concerned.

Not all city landmarks are buildings. However, buildings are the
principal landmarks in cities and the principles which make them serve
well or ill apply also to most other kinds of landmarks, such as
monuments, dramatic fountains, and so on.

Satisfying distinction in the appearance of a building almost always
grows out of distinction in its use, as discussed in [Chapter
Twelve](#calibre_link-22){.calibre7}. The same building can be
physically distinctive in one matrix because its use is distinctive in
that context, but can be un-distinctive in another setting where its use
is the rule rather than the exception. The distinctiveness of a landmark
depends considerably on reciprocity between the landmark and its
neighbors.

In New York, Trinity Church, at the head of Wall Street, is a well-known
and effective landmark. But Trinity would be relatively pallid as an
element of city design if it were merely one among an assemblage of
churches or even of other symbolic-looking institutions. Trinity's
physical distinction, which is anything []{#calibre_link-2331 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="385"}but pallid in its setting, depends partly
on its good landmark site---at a T intersection and a rise in
ground---but it also depends greatly on Trinity's functional distinction
in its context of office buildings. So dominant is this fact of
difference that Trinity makes a satisfying climax for its street scene,
even though it is much smaller than its neighbors. An office building of
this size (or any size) at this same advantageous spot, in this context,
simply could not perform this service nor convey this degree of visual
order, let alone do it with such unlabored and "natural" rightness.

Just so, the New York Public Library building, set in its commercial
matrix at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street, forms an excellent
landmark, but this is not true of the public libraries of San Francisco,
Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as examples. These have the disadvantage of
being set among institutions which contrast insufficiently in function
or---inevitably---in appearance.

Back in [Chapter Eight](#calibre_link-18){.calibre7}, which deals with
the need for mixed primary uses, I discussed the functional value of
dotting important civic buildings within the workaday city, instead of
assembling them into cultural or civic projects. In addition to the
functional awkwardnesses and the economic waste of primary diversity
that these projects cause, the buildings assembled into such islands of
pomp are badly underused as landmarks. They pale each other, although
each one, by itself, could make a tremendously effective impression and
symbol of city diversity. This is serious, because we badly need more,
not fewer, city landmarks---great landmarks and small.

Sometimes attempts are made to give a building landmark quality simply
by making it bigger than its neighbors, or by turning it out with
stylistic differences. Usually, if the use of such a building is
essentially the same as the uses of its neighbors, it is pallid---try as
it might. Nor does such a building do us that extra service of
clarifying and dignifying diversity of uses. Indeed, it tries to tell us
that what is important in the order of cities are mere differences in
size or outward dress. Except in very rare cases of real architectural
masterpieces, this statement that style or size is everything gets from
city users, who are not so dumb, about the affection and attention it
deserves.

However, it should be noted that some buildings which depend
[]{#calibre_link-2336 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="386"}on size for
their distinction do provide good landmark orientation service and
visual interest for people *at a distance*. In New York, the Empire
State Building and the Consolidated Edison Tower with its great
illuminated clock are examples. For people seeing them from the streets
close by, these same buildings, inconsequential in their differences
from neighboring buildings, are inconsequential as landmarks.
Philadelphia City Hall, with its tower surmounted by the statue of
William Penn, makes a splendid landmark from afar; and its true, not
superficial, difference within its intimate matrix of city also makes it
a splendid landmark from close by. For distant landmarks, size can
sometimes serve. For intimate landmarks, distinction of use and a
statement about the importance of differences are of the essence.

These principles apply to minor landmarks too. A grade school can be a
local landmark, by virtue of its special use in its surroundings,
combined with visibility. Many different uses can serve as landmarks,
provided they are special in their own context. For instance, people
from Spokane, Washington, say that a physically distinctive and beloved
landmark there is the Davenport Hotel, which serves, as hotels sometimes
do, also as a unique and major center of city public life and assembly.
In a place that is mainly residential, working places that are well seen
can make landmarks, and often do.

Some outdoor spaces that are focal centers, or, as they are sometimes
called, nodes, behave very much like landmarks and get much of their
power as clarifiers of order from the distinctiveness of their use, just
as in the case of landmark buildings. The plaza at Rockefeller Center in
New York is such a place; to users of the city on the ground in its
vicinity it is much more of a "landmark" than the towering structure
behind it or the lesser towers further enclosing it.

Now let us consider that second extra service which landmarks can
perform to clarify the order of cities: their ability to help state
explicitly and visually that a place is important which is in truth
functionally important.

Centers of activity, where the paths of many people come together in
concentrated fashion, are important places economically and socially in
cities. Sometimes they are important in the life of a
[]{#calibre_link-2341 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="387"}city as a
whole, sometimes to a particular district or neighborhood. Yet such
centers may not have the visual distinction or importance merited by the
functional truth. When this is the case, a user is being given
contradictory and confusing information. The sight of the activity and
the intensity of land use says Importance. The absence of any visual
climax or dignifying object says Unimportance.

Because commerce is so predominant in most city centers of activity, an
effective landmark in such a place usually needs to be overtly
uncommercial.

People become deeply attached to landmarks that occur in centers of
activity and in this their instincts about city order are correct. In
Greenwich Village, the old Jefferson Market Courthouse, now abandoned as
a courthouse, occupies a prominent site abutting on one of the
community's busiest areas. It is an elaborate Victorian building, and
opinions differ radically as to whether it is architecturally handsome
or architecturally ugly. However, there is a remarkable degree of
unanimity, *even among those who do not like the building as a
building*, that it must be retained and used for something. Citizens
from the area, as well as architectural students working under their
direction, have devoted immense amounts of time to detailed study of the
building interior, its condition and its potentialities. Existing civic
organizations have put time, effort and pressure into the job of saving
it, and a new organization was even started to finance the repair of the
public clock on the tower and get it going! The Public Library system,
having been shown the architectural and economic practicality, has now
asked the city for funds to convert the building to a major branch
library.

Why all the to-do over a peculiar building on a centrally located site
which could make a lot of quick money for somebody and some extra taxes
for the city, if it were used for commerce and residences, like most
sites around it?

Functionally, it happens that just such a difference in use as a library
is needed here, to help counter the self-destruction of diversity.
However, few people are aware of this functional need, or conscious that
just such a building can help to anchor diversity. Rather, there seems
to be a strong popular agreement that []{#calibre_link-2346 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="388"}*visually* the whole busy neighborhood of
this landmark will lose its point---in short, its order will blur rather
than clarify---if this landmark is replaced by a duplication of the uses
that already exist around it.

Even an inherently meaningless landmark in a center of activity seems to
contribute to the users' satisfaction. For instance, in St. Louis there
stands a tall concrete column in the middle of a down-at-heel commercial
center in declining, gray area surroundings. It once served as a water
tower. Many years ago, when the water tank was removed, the local
citizens prevailed on City Hall to save the pedestal, which they
themselves then repaired. It still gives to the district its name, "The
Watertower," and it still gives a bit of pathetic distinction to its
district too, which would otherwise hardly even be recognizable as a
place.

As clarifiers of city order, landmarks do best when they are set right
amidst their neighbors, as in the case of all the examples I have
mentioned. If they are buffered off and isolated from the generalized
scene, they are contradicting, instead of explaining and visually
reinforcing, an important fact about city differences: that they support
each other. This too needs to be said by suggestion.

::: {#calibre_link-2349 .section_break}
---
:::

Eye-catchers, as already mentioned in the case of visual street
interruptions, have an importance in city appearance out of all
proportion to the physical space they occupy.

Some eye-catchers are eye-catchers just by virtue of *what* they are,
rather than because of precisely *where* they are: an odd building for
instance, or a little group of differing buildings standing out, because
of themselves, in the wide-angle view across a park space. I think it is
neither necessary nor desirable to try deliberately to create or to
control this category of eye-catchers. Where diversity is generated,
where there is mixture in building ages and types, and where there are
opportunity and welcome for many people's plans and tastes, eye-catchers
of this kind always turn up, and they are more surprising, various and
interesting than anyone, aiming primarily at city design, could
deliberately plan. Truth is stranger than fiction.

Other eye-catchers, however, are eye-catchers because of *precisely
[]{#calibre_link-2353 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="389"}where* they
are, and these are necessary to consider as a deliberate part of city
design. First of all, there must be spots that, simply as locations, do
catch the eye---for example, visual street interruptions. Second, these
spots must count for something. These highly visible spots are few and
exceptional; they are only one or two among many scores of buildings and
locations comprising a street scene. We cannot therefore depend on the
law of averages or on chance alone to deliver us visual accents in
exactly these natural eye-catcher spots. Often, no more is needed than a
good paint color (and a subtraction of billboards) on a building that
already exists. Sometimes a new building or new use is needed in these
spots---even a landmark. By taking care with the relatively very few
spots that are inevitable eye-catchers, much character, interest and
accent can be given to a whole scene by suggestion, and with the least
design regimentation and the greatest economy of means and tactics.

The importance of such places, and the importance of making them count
are points well made in *Planning and Community Appearance,* a booklet
prepared by a committee of New York planners and architects formed to
investigate the problems of municipal design control. The committee's
principal recommendation was that the crucial visual spots in a
community be identified, and that *these small spots be zoned to require
exceptional treatment.* No good can come, said the committee's report,
of blandly including such eye-catching locations in general schemes of
zoning and planning.[\*^3^](#calibre_link-153){#calibre_link-157
.calibre7} Their locations alone give buildings on these few sites
special and exceptional significance, and when we ignore that fact we
are ignoring the most tangible realities.

There are some city streets which, in the absence of excellent
eye-catchers, or even in addition to eye-catchers, need another kind of
design help too. They need unifying devices, to suggest that the street,
with all its diversity, is also an entity.

I have mentioned, in [Chapter Twelve](#calibre_link-22){.calibre7}, a
tactic suitable for some []{#calibre_link-2358 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="390"}streets of mixed residences and commerce,
to prevent them from being visually exploded or disintegrated by
incongruously large uses. The suitable tactic for visual unity on these
streets, as already explained, is to zone a limit on the length of
street frontage permitted any single enterprise.

For another family of street unifying tactics, we can exploit the
principle that a strong, but otherwise unobtrusive, design element can
tie together in orderly fashion much happenstance detail. This kind of
unification can be useful on streets that are heavily used, much seen
and contain much detail without much real variety of use---streets
almost entirely commercial, for instance.

One of the simplest such devices is trees along the stretch to be
unified, but trees planted close enough together to give a look of
continuity when they are seen close up, as well as when the space
between them is elided by distance. Pavements have possibilities as
unifiers; that is, sidewalk pavements with strong, simple patterns.
Awnings in strong colors have possibilities.

Each street that needs this kind of help is its own problem, and
probably needs its own
solution.[\*^4^](#calibre_link-154){#calibre_link-158 .calibre7} There
is a pitfall inherent in unification devices. One reason for a unifier's
power is that it is special to a place. The sky itself, in a way, ties
together nearly every scene, but its very ubiquity makes it an
ineffective visual unifier of most scenes. A unifier supplies only the
visual suggestion of entity and order; the viewer does most of the job
of unifying by using the hint to help him organize what he sees. If he
sees exactly the same unifier in otherwise disparate places and scenes,
he will soon unconsciously discount it.

::: {#calibre_link-2362 .section_break}
---
:::

All these various tactics for capturing city visual order are concerned
with bits and pieces in the city---bits and pieces which are, to be
sure, knit into a city fabric of use that is as continuous and little
cut apart as possible. But emphasis on bits and pieces is of the
essence: this is what a city is, bits and pieces that supplement each
other and support each other.

[]{#calibre_link-2365 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="391"}Perhaps
this all seems very commonplace compared with the sweep and swoop of
highways, or the eerily beautiful beehive huts of tribal kraals. But
what we have to express in expressing our cities is not be be scorned.
Their intricate order---a manifestation of the freedom of countless
numbers of people to make and carry out countless plans---is in many
ways a great wonder. We ought not to be reluctant to make this living
collection of interdependent uses, this freedom, this life, more
understandable for what it is, nor so unaware that we do not know what
it is.

::: {#calibre_link-2366 .footnote}

[\*^1^](#calibre_link-155){.calibre7} About a similar phenomenon,
regarding highways, Professor Lynch makes this comment: "Many \[Los
Angeles\] subjects had difficulty in making a mental connection between
the fast highway and the remainder of the city structure, just as in the
Boston case. They would, in imagination, even walk across the Hollywood
Freeway as if it did not exist. A high-speed artery may not necessarily
be the best way of visually delimiting a central district."

extra street, Vanderbilt Avenue, with T terminations, and at
Vanderbilt's northern T is a handsome new building, Union Carbide, which
in effect bridges the sidewalk; the short blocks between Vanderbilt and
Madison are illustrative, by the way, of the liveliness and pedestrian
convenience natural to short blocks in cities.

[\*^3^](#calibre_link-157){.calibre7} This booklet, obtainable from the
New York Regional Plan Association, also discusses the legislative,
regulatory and tax arrangements required by such an approach, and is
thus valuable to anyone seriously interested in city visual order.

[\*^4^](#calibre_link-158){.calibre7} The effects of various kinds of
unifiers---as well as of visual interruptions good and bad, landmarks
and much else---are pictured and explained in two remarkable books on
design in English cities, towns and countryside, *Outrage* and *Counter
Attack*, both by Gordon Cullen and Ian Nairn.

# Salvaging projects {#calibre_link-2371 .chaphead1}
:::

One of the unsuitable ideas behind projects is the very notion that they
*are* projects, abstracted out of the ordinary city and set apart. To
think of salvaging or improving projects, *as projects*, is to repeat
this root mistake. The aim should be to get that project, that patch
upon the city, rewoven back into the fabric---and in the process of
doing so, strengthen the surrounding fabric too.

Reweaving projects back into the city is necessary not only to bring
life to dangerous or inert projects themselves. It is also necessary for
larger district planning. Cut up physically by projects and their border
vacuums, handicapped socially and economically by the isolation of too
small neighborhoods, a city district cannot be a district in truth,
coherent enough and large enough to count.

The underlying principles for bringing life to a project site itself and
to the borders where it must be rejoined with the district are the same
as the principles for helping any city area where vitality is low. The
planners have to diagnose which conditions []{#calibre_link-2375
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="393"}for generating diversity are
missing here---whether there is a lack of mixed primary uses, whether
the blocks are too large, whether there is insufficient mixture in ages
and types of buildings, whether the concentration of people is great
enough. Then, whatever among those conditions is missing has to be
supplied---usually gradually and opportunistically---as best it can be.

In the case of housing projects, the fundamental problems can be much
like those presented by unplanned, low-vitality gray areas and engulfed
former suburbs. In the case of nonresidential projects, such as cultural
or civic centers, the fundamental problems can be much like those
presented by has-been parts of downtowns which have suffered the
self-destruction of diversity.

However, because projects and their borders present special kinds of
obstacles to supplying the conditions necessary for generating diversity
(and sometimes special kinds of obstacles to the process of unslumming
too), their salvage does require some special tactics.

::: {#calibre_link-2378 .section_break}
---
:::

The projects that today most urgently need salvaging are low-income
housing projects. Their failures drastically affect the everyday lives
of many people, especially children. Moreover, because they are too
dangerous, demoralizing and unstable within themselves, they make it too
hard in many cases to maintain tolerable civilization in their
vicinities. Immense investments have gone into federal- and
state-financed housing projects; these expenditures, in spite of having
been ill conceived, are too large to write off, even for a country as
rich as ours. To salvage the investments themselves, the projects must
be converted into the assets to human life and to cities that it was
hoped they would become.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-159){#calibre_link-161
.calibre7}

[]{#calibre_link-2381 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="394"}These
projects, like any slums, need to be unslummed. This means, among other
things, that they must be capable of holding their populations through
*choice*. It means they must be safe and otherwise workable for city
life. They need, among other things, casual public characters, lively,
well-watched, continuously used public spaces, easier and more natural
supervision of children, and normal city cross-use of their territory by
people from outside it. In short, in the process of being rejoined into
the city fabric, these projects need to take on the qualities of healthy
city fabric themselves.

The easiest way to get at this problem mentally is to imagine, first,
that the project ground level, right up to its perimeter roadbeds, is
virtually a clean and empty slate. Above it float the apartment houses,
attached to the ground only by their stairs and elevator stacks. All
kinds of things can be done on this almost clean slate.

In real life, to be sure, this theoretical clean slate will not always
be so clean as that. Sometimes there are other fixed features besides
elevators and stairs on that ground-level plane. Some projects contain
on their grounds schools or settlement houses or churches. Once in a
while there are large trees that ought to be kept if possible, and very
occasionally indeed there is some outdoor space which works well enough
and is unique enough to hold on to.

The grounds of newer projects---and especially most of those built since
1950---automatically make much cleaner ground-level slates than older
projects, when thought of in this way. This is because, as time has gone
on, housing project design has become ever more a routine matter of
plunking down ever higher towers in ever more vacuous settings.

On this slate new streets must be designed: real streets which
[]{#calibre_link-2386 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="395"}are to
receive buildings and new uses along them; not "promenades" through
vacuous "parks." These streets must be laid out in small blocks. Small
public parks should be included to be sure, and sports or play areas,
but only in quantities and in places where busy new streets and their
uses can enforce safety and insure attraction.

The placement of these new streets will be influenced by two principal
physical considerations: First, they must tie in with streets beyond the
project borders, because the prime object is to knit this site with what
lies around it. (An important part of the problem will be the redesign
and added uses for the project's side of its border street itself.)
Second, the new streets must also tie into the few fixed features within
the project site. The apartment buildings, which we have been thinking
of as floating above the site, attached only by elevators and stairs,
can become street buildings, with their ground floors redesigned and
incorporated into streetside uses; or if they are "missed" by the
street, their access points can be gotten to by short Walks or spurs
leading off streets between new street-side buildings. The existing
towers, in any case, will now rise here and there above the new streets,
the new buildings, the new city which will lie below them.

Of course, it will typically be impossible to design streets that tie
into the city surrounding, into the immutable fixed site features, and
are at the same time straight, regular grid patterns on the site. As in
the case of new streets cut through other city blocks that are too long,
they will likely have bends, jogs and T intersections. So much the
better, as I have argued in the previous chapter.

What sorts of new street uses and street buildings are possible?

The general aim should be to bring in uses different from residence,
because lack of enough mixed uses is precisely one of the causes of
deadness, danger and plain inconvenience. These different uses can
occupy entire new street-side buildings, or merely the first floors or
basements of buildings. Almost any kind of work use would be especially
valuable; also evening uses and general commerce, particularly if these
will draw good cross-use from outside the project's former boundaries.

[]{#calibre_link-2392 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="396"}Getting
this diversity is more easily said than done, because buildings on new
streets on a project site will carry the serious economic burden of
being composed of virtually all new construction, instead of being of
mingled ages. This is a truly formidable handicap; there is no way of
overcoming it ideally---it is one of the handicaps we inherit in
inheriting projects. However, there are several ways of minimizing this.

One means, possibly the most promising, is to depend in part upon
vendors who use carts and do not require buildings. This is a partial
economic substitute for the missing old, low-overhead store space.

Deliberate street arrangements for vendors can be full of life,
attraction and interest, and because of bargains are excellent
stimulators of cross-use. Moreover, they can be delightful-looking. A
Philadelphia architect, Robert Geddes, has designed an interesting
vendor area for a proposed commercial renewal street in that city. In
the street problem which Geddes had, the vendor area was to be a market
plaza, across the street from a small public building; on its side of
the street the plaza was enclosed on two sides by the sides of adjoining
store and apartment buildings, but there was nothing enclosing it across
the rear (it penetrated only half through its block and abutted
parking). Geddes designed, as a backdrop, an attractive but economical
shed for garaging the carts after business hours.

A street-side shed for cart garaging could be used along stretches of
project streets, just as well as it can be used in a plaza design.

Outdoor vending would be an excellent eye-catcher for extending across T
intersections or street bends. You will recall that what goes into an
eye-catching street site has much to do with giving an impression of
character to a whole scene. One of the difficult visual problems of
project salvage will be to make these places look lively and urban
enough; they have so much grimness and visual repetition to overcome.

Another possible means for partially overcoming the handicap of too much
new construction would depend on the device of guaranteed-rent
dwellings. These buildings could be placed on project streets, the same
as on any other city streets, as described []{#calibre_link-2398
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="397"}in [Chapter
Seventeen](#calibre_link-29){.calibre7}. However, they could be
specified as row houses, or as double duplexes (one duplex on top of
another, making four stories). Just as rows of old city brownstones have
proved convertible to many kinds of different city uses and combinations
of uses, generally one or two buildings at a time, or even one or two
floors at a time, so would these basically similar small buildings be
inherently flexible. They would represent, from the beginning, a
use-conversion reservoir.

Still another possibility has been worked out by Perkins & Will, Chicago
and White Plains architects, who, as a public service, devised for Union
Settlement in New York a number of new ideas in public housing project
design. Among the Perkins & Will proposals were four-story flats, placed
on stilts to form an open "basement," with the basement floor either at
ground level or four feet below ground level; one purpose was to make
possible cheap enclosure of space for stores or other uses. The
half-level basements made the flats above only a half-story instead of a
full story above ground; this arrangement, besides being economical,
would make a good street variation, because stores or workshops in
basements, reached by a few steps down from the street, are often
popular and attractive.

Still another possibility is to build some of the street-side edifices
in cheap and makeshift fashion (which does not necessarily mean they
must be ugly), with the intention of making overhead low at the most
economically difficult stage, and their replacement practical in future
when economic success warrants it. This is not as promising as the other
methods, however, because buildings built well enough to stand five
years or ten years have to be built well enough to stand a great deal
longer. It is hard to give buildings a calculated built-in obsolescence
and make really appreciable savings.

All housing projects with tall buildings are especially handicapped in
supervision of children, and even after salvage work it will still be
impossible to supervise children from the high apartments in the way
that children on normal city sidewalks can be supervised from the
windows of flats, houses or tenements above. This is one reason it is so
imperative to get adults circulating around and spreading themselves
through time in all public []{#calibre_link-2402 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="398"}spaces at ground level, to get small
businessmen with their typical propensity for public law and order, to
get other public characters too, and to have streets sufficiently active
and interesting so that they will be watched reasonably well from
dwellings in at least the first three or four stories of buildings, the
floors from which surveillance counts most.

One of the project planning delusions has been the notion that projects
can evade the general workings of city land economics. To be sure, by
making use of subsidies and of the powers of condemnation, it is
possible to evade the *financial* need for good economic environment for
city commerce and other uses. However, it is one thing to get around a
financial problem, and another to evade basic economic functioning.
Project sites are of course as dependent as any other fragments of city
geography on intensity of use, and to get it they have to have a good
economic environment for it. How good this economic environment can be
depends in part on the new arrangements and new mixtures of uses within
former project grounds, and on gradual unslumming and
self-diversification in the project population. But it also depends on
how well the surrounding territory is generating diversity and
cross-use.

If the area as a whole, along with its former projects, becomes lively,
improving and unslumming, the nonhousing uses on former project grounds
should eventually be able to produce a good return. But these grounds
have so many handicaps to begin with, and so much needs to be done from
scratch, that considerable public money will be needed for salvage:
money will be needed for site replanning and designing itself, which
will take a heavy investment in time and imagination because this time
it cannot be done routinely or by people ignorant of what they are doing
and why; money will be needed for construction of streets and other
public spaces; and probably money will be needed for subsidy to at least
some of the new building construction.

Whether or not the ownership of the already existing dwellings
themselves remains with the housing authorities, the new streets and new
uses, including new dwellings mixed with them, cannot be the property
and responsibility of these agencies, putting them into a politically
impossible (and unwise) competition with private []{#calibre_link-2406
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="399"}building owners. Nor should
housing authorities be given the responsibility of reweaving their old
baronies back into the free city, a responsibility for which they are in
no way whatever equipped. This land was taken by governmental powers for
the authorities. It can be taken from them by governmental powers,
replanned, and lots for building sold off or rented under long-term
leases. Portions, of course, should go under the jurisdiction of
appropriate city agencies, such as the department of parks and the
department of streets.

Apart from physical and economic improvements at ground level such as
those suggested, the salvage of public housing requires some other
changes.

The corridors of the usual high-rise, low-income housing building are
like corridors in a bad dream: creepily lit, narrow, smelly, blind. They
feel like traps, and they are. So are the elevators that lead to them.
These traps are what people mean when they say, time and again, "Where
can we go? Not to a project! I have children. I have young daughters."

Much has been written about the fact that children urinate in housing
project elevators. It is an obvious problem because it leaves a smell
and corrodes the machinery. But this is perhaps the most innocuous
misuse of project self-service elevators. More serious is the terror
that people can feel in them, with good reason.

The only solution that I can see to this problem, and to the related
corridor problem, is to provide elevator attendants. Nothing else, not
guards on the grounds, not doormen, no form of "tenant education" can
make these buildings tolerably safe or their people tolerably secure
from predators coming both from outside the project and from within.

This too will take money, but little compared to the tremendous
investments that have to be salvaged---as much as \$40,000,000 in single
projects. I mention \$40,000,000 because that happens to be the public
investment in Frederick Douglass Houses, a new project on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan, where there has occurred, along with all the usual
terrors, an elevator crime so appallingly savage that the newspapers
have taken notice of it.

In Caracas, Venezuela, where the deposed dictator left a large
[]{#calibre_link-2414 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="400"}legacy of
similar projects with similar dangers, an experiment in improving
elevator and corridor safety is reported to have helped. Women tenants
who can manage full- or part-time jobs are hired as regular elevator
attendants from 6:00 [A]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}. to 1:00
[A]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}., when elevator service is discontinued.
Carl Feiss, a U. S. planning consultant who has done considerable work
in Venezuela tells me that the buildings are safer, and that general
communication and social tone have also been somewhat improved because
the elevator operators have become rudimentary public characters.

Women tenants as attendants might work well in our projects too during
the day, when the principal elevator misuses are extortion and sexual
molestation of younger children by older children. I suspect that the
night shift, when adult attacks, muggings and robberies are a greater
danger, would require men as attendants. It is also doubtful that the
night service cut-off would work for us, first, because too many tenants
in these projects have night jobs and, second, because too many
arbitrary rules, different from those applying to other people, already
set the projects apart and feed residents' resentments and
bitterness.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-160){#calibre_link-162 .calibre7}

To unslum, public housing projects must be capable of holding people by
choice when they develop choice (which means they must become gladly
attached before they have choice), and for this the kinds of salvage
already suggested, outside and inside, are necessary. However, in
addition, people must of course be permitted to stay by choice, which
means that maximum income []{#calibre_link-2417 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="401"}limits must be abandoned. It is not enough
to raise limits; the tie of residency to income price tags must be
abandoned altogether. So long as it remains, not only will all the most
successful or lucky inexorably be drained away, but all the others must
psychologically identify themselves with their homes either as
transients or as "failures."

Rents should be increased in accord with increased incomes, up to the
point where full economic rent is paid, as in the proposed
guaranteed-rent system, already explained. This economic rent figure
would have to include pro-rated amortization and debt service, to work
capital costs back into the rent equation.

No one, or even two, of the suggestions I have made will be effective as
an all-purpose salvager in itself. All three---grounds reconverted and
woven back into surrounding city; safety inside buildings; removal of
maximum income limits---are necessary. Naturally, the quickest positive
results can be expected in the projects where demoralization and the
going-backward process of the perpetual slum have wreaked the least
harm.

Middle-income housing projects are not so urgent a salvage problem as
low-income projects, but in some ways they are more baffling.

Unlike low-income project tenants, many middle-income project tenants
appear to favor sorting themselves into islands distinctly apart from
other people. My impression, which I admit is shaky, is that
middle-income projects, as they age, tend to contain a significant (or
at least articulate) proportion of people who are fearful of contact
outside their class. How much such tendencies are innate to people who
have chosen to live in class-segregated and regimented projects, and to
what extent these feelings are cultivated and developed by Turf living
itself, I do not know. My acquaintances in a number of middle-income
projects tell me they have observed in their neighbors the growth of
hostility to the city outside their project borders as disturbing
incidents have occurred in their own elevators and in their own
grounds---incidents for which outsiders ate invariably blamed, with or
without evidence. The growth and hardening of Turf psychology because
[]{#calibre_link-2423 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="402"}of real
dangers---or the concentration together of appreciable numbers of people
already beset with xenophobia, whichever it may be---is a serious
problem for big cities.

People who live behind project borders and who feel estranged and deeply
unsafe about the city across those borders are not going to be much help
in eliminating district border vacuums, or even in permitting replanning
aimed at rejoining them with the fabric of a city district.

It may be that districts which contain projects exhibiting advanced
xenophobia must simply proceed to improve, as districts, in spite of
this handicap, as best they can. If the streets outside such projects
can nevertheless be catalyzed into greater safety, diversity and
vitality, and increased stability of population, and if at the same
time, within the project borders, the built-in dangers resulting from
vacuity are ameliorated in any ways that do prove acceptable to the
project residents and to the insurance companies, labor unions,
cooperatives and private entrepreneurs who own these places, perhaps in
time it will be possible to knit them in with the living city. Certainly
the hope of doing so grows less and less, the more the district around
them is converted into stereotyped and dangerous projects too.

::: {#calibre_link-2426 .section_break}

:::

Nonresidential projects, such as cultural or civic centers, can probably
in a few cases employ ground replanning tactics to weave them back into
the city fabric. The most promising cases are centers located at the
edges of downtowns, with little but the buffers and border vacuums
resulting from their own presence between themselves and potentially
supplementary high-intensity uses. One side of Pittsburgh's new civic
center, at least, might be rewoven into the downtown, from which it is
now buffered. Parts of San Francisco's civic center might be rewoven
into the city with new streets and new uses added.

The main difficulty with civic centers, especially those that contain
buildings such as auditoriums and halls, bringing huge concentrations of
people for relatively brief times, is to find other primary uses at
least roughly proportionate in the concentrations of people that they
can supply at other times of day. There still has to be room, somewhere,
for the range and amount of secondary []{#calibre_link-2429 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="403"}diversity that these combined intensive
uses can support; and of course the problem exists of insufficient older
buildings for a good range of secondary diversity. In short, the trouble
is that many civic and cultural center components make sense only as
elements of intensive downtown or central use, and to try to make them
serve so, once they have been abstracted into islands, means trying to
move the mountain to Mahomet.

A more practical way to approach reintegration in most cases, I think,
is to aim at disassembling these centers, over periods of time.
Dissassembly can occur as opportunity and expediency permit it. The
point is to watch for the opportunities. Such an opportunity occurred,
for example, in Philadelphia, at the time the downtown Broad Street
Station and Pennsylvania Railroad track embankment were removed, and the
office-transportation-hotel project of Penn Center was planned in their
place. The Philadelphia Free Library, stuck off on a cultural-center
boulevard where it gets shockingly little use, was at this time in need
of major rehabilitation. Its officials tried hard and long to persuade
the city that, instead of redoing the old building, it would be better
to move the library out of the cultural center and into the downtown, as
part of the Penn Center plan. Apparently nobody responsible in the city
government saw that just this kind of reinfiltration of central cultural
facilities into the downtown was necessary---for the downtown and for
the vitality of the cultural facilities themselves.

If assembled components of cultural and civic islands are disassembled
and leave their islands, one by one, as opportunity affords, entirely
different uses can be put in their places---preferably uses that will
not only be different rather than similar, but that, in their
differences, will supplement what remains in the project.

Philadelphia, while perpetuating its old library mistake, at least saved
itself from piling on another mistake---because by this time
Philadelphia has had enough experience with a cultural center to be
somewhat disenchanted with the supposed vitalizing powers of such a
place. When the Academy of Music, which is in the downtown, needed
rehabilitation a few years ago, almost nobody took seriously the idea
that it should be transplanted to []{#calibre_link-2433 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="404"}the culture reservation. It was kept where
it belongs, downtown. Baltimore, after playing around for years with
this plan and that for an abstracted and isolated civic-cultural center,
has decided instead to build downtown, where these facilities can count
most both as needed primary uses and as landmarks.

This is, of course, the best way to salvage any kind of sorted-out
project, up to the time it is actually built: Think better of it.

::: {#calibre_link-2435 .footnote}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\*^1^](#calibre_link-161){.calibre7} The silliest conception of salvage
is to build a duplicate of the first failure and move the people from
the first failure into its expensive duplicate, so the first failure can
be salvaged! This is a stage of slum shifting and slum duplicating that
our cities are reaching, however. Buffalo, for example, has a low-income
project named Dante Place, built with federal funds in 1954. Dante Place
has speedily become a festering sore; it "represented an obstacle to the
development of the land adjacent to it," in the words of the city's
Housing Authority director. Solution: A new project, much like Dante
Place, has been built in another part of town, and the inhabitants of
Dante Place are to be moved there to fester so Dante Place can be
salvaged---which means so it can be converted to a middle-income
project. This process of correcting mistakes by compounding them was
hailed in November 1959 by the New York State Commissioner of Housing as
progress that "may well set a pattern for other housing authorities."

[\*^2^](#calibre_link-162){.calibre7} Nowadays, relatively few people
enter low-income projects by free choice; rather, they have been thrown
out of their previous neighborhoods to make way for "urban renewal" or
highways and, especially if they are colored and therefore subject to
housing discrimination, have had no other choice. Among the dislocated,
only about 20 percent (in Philadelphia, Chicago and New York, for which
figures have been published) go into public housing; among those who do
not are many who are eligible but will not go because they can find some
other way out. Describing this maddening obstinacy of those still lucky
enough to have some choice, a New York City housing official cited 16
dislocated families who were eligible for three-bedroom apartments,
which were waiting for them, in public housing. "They had eviction
papers in their hands, but not one would take public housing."

# Governing and planning districts {#calibre_link-2440 .chaphead1}
:::

A public hearing in a big city is apt to be a curious affair,
simultaneously discouraging and heartening. The ones I know best are
held in New York's City Hall, alternate Thursdays, on measures that
require decision by the city's chief governing body, the Board of
Estimate. The subjects have appeared on the day's hearing calendar by
prior pushing, pulling and contriving on the part of somebody either in
government or out.

Citizens who wish to speak their minds address the Mayor, the five
Borough Presidents, the Comptroller and the President of the City
Council, who sit behind a raised semicircular bench at one end of a
large and handsome room filled with high-backed white pews for the
public. Public officials, elected and appointed, turn up on those pews
too, to oppose or to advocate controversial items. Sometimes the
sessions are calm and speedy; but often they are tumultuous and last not
only all day, but far into the night. Whole segments of city life,
problems of neighborhood upon []{#calibre_link-2443 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="406"}neighborhood, district upon district,
parades of remarkable personalities, all come alive in this room. The
members of the Board listen, interject and sometimes hand down decrees
on the spot, like rulers holding court in the manor during medieval
days.[\*^1^](#calibre_link-163){#calibre_link-168 .calibre7}

I became an addict of the Board of Estimate sessions as a fierce and
rooted partisan at just such hearings, and I cannot lose my habit of
involvement as some other district's problems are cried out here or some
other neighborhood's cause is pled. In one sense, the whole affair is
exasperating. So many of the problems need never have arisen. If only
well-meaning officials in departments of the city government or in
freewheeling authorities knew intimately, and cared about, the streets
or districts which their schemes so vitally affect---or if they knew in
the least what the citizens of that place consider of value in their
lives, and why. So many of the conflicts would never occur if planners
and other supposed experts understood in the least how cities work and
respected those workings. Still other issues, it appears, involve forms
of favoritism, deals or arbitrary administrative acts which outrage
voters but for which they can find no effective place to pin
responsibility or seek repair. In many cases too (not all), the hundreds
of people who have lost a day's pay, or have made arrangements for care
of their children, or have brought their children along and sit hour
upon hour with youngsters fidgeting in their laps, are being hoaxed; it
has all been decided before they are heard.

Even more discouraging than all this is the sense one soon gets of
problems which are out of the control of everyone. Their ramifications
are too complex; too many different kinds of trouble, need and services
are interlocked in a given place---too many to be understood, let alone
helped or handled when they are attacked, one-sidedly and remotely, by
the sprawling municipal government's []{#calibre_link-2446 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="407"}separate administrative empires, each by
each. It is the blind men feeling the elephant again. Helplessness, and
its partner futility, become almost palpable during these hearings.

On the other hand, though, the proceedings are heartening, because of
the abounding vitality, earnestness and sense with which so many of the
citizens rise to the occasion. Very plain people, including the poor,
including the discriminated against, including the uneducated, reveal
themselves momentarily as people with grains of greatness in them, and I
do not speak sardonically. They tell with wisdom and often eloquence
about things they know first-hand from life. They speak with passion
about concerns that are local but far from narrow. To be sure, foolish
things are said too, and untrue things, and things brazenly or suavely
self-seeking; and it is good, too, to see the effects of these remarks.
We listeners are seldom fooled, I think; it is clear from our responses
that we understand and rate these sentiments for what they are. There is
experience at living, responsibility and concern in abundance among the
city's people. There is cynicism but there is also faith, and this is,
of course, what counts most.

The eight rulers who sit behind the raised bench (we cannot call them
servants of the people as the conventions of government have it, for
servants would know more of their masters' affairs), these rulers are
not sorry specimens either. Most of us present, I think, are grateful
that we have at least a dim and glimmering chance (so seldom fulfilled)
of prevailing upon them to protect us from the oversimplifications of
the experts, the blind men feeling the elephant. We watch and study our
rulers as best we can. Their energy, wits, patience and human
responsiveness are, on the whole, creditable. I see no reason to expect
great improvement from finding better. These are not boys sent on a
man's errand. These are men sent on a superman's errand.

The trouble is, they are trying to deal with the intimate details of a
great metropolis with an organizational structure to back them up,
advise them, inform them, guide them and pressure them, that has become
anachronistic. There is no villainy responsible for this situation, not
even the villainy of pass-the-buck; the villainy, if it can be called
that, is a most understandable failure by our society to keep abreast of
demanding historical changes.

[]{#calibre_link-2451 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="408"}The
historical changes relevant in this case are not only an immense
increase in the size of great cities, but also the immensely increased
responsibilities---for housing, for welfare, for health, for education,
for regulatory planning---which have been taken on by the governments of
great municipalities. New York is not unique in failing to match such
profound changes in circumstances with appropriate functional changes in
administrative and planning structure. Every great American city is at a
similar impasse.

When human affairs reach, in truth and in fact, new levels of
complication, the only thing that can be done is to devise means of
maintaining things well at the new level. The alternative is what Lewis
Mumford has aptly called "unbuilding," the fate of a society which
cannot maintain the complexity on which it is built and on which it
depends.

The ruthless, oversimplified, pseudo-city planning and pseudo-city
design we get today is a form of "unbuilding" cities. But although it
was shaped and sanctified by reactionary theories actually glorifying
the "unbuilding" of cities, the practice and influence of this kind of
planning today rests not on theory alone. Insensibly and gradually, as
city administrative organization has failed to evolve suitably along
with city growth and complexity, city "unbuilding" has become a
destructive but practical necessity for planning and other
administrative staffs, whose members are also being sent on supermen's
errands. Routine, ruthless, wasteful, oversimplified solutions for all
manner of city physical needs (let alone social and economic needs)
*have* to be devised by administrative systems which have lost the power
to comprehend, to handle and to value an infinity of vital, unique,
intricate and interlocked details.

Consider, for a moment, the kind of goals at which city planning must
begin to aim, if the object is to plan for city vitality.

Planning for vitality must stimulate and catalyze the greatest possible
range and quantity of diversity among uses and among people throughout
each district of a big city; this is the underlying foundation of city
economic strength, social vitality and magnetism. To do this, planners
must diagnose, in specific places, []{#calibre_link-2456 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="409"}specifically what is lacking to generate
diversity, and then aim at helping to supply the lacks as best they can
be supplied.

Planning for vitality must promote continuous networks of local street
neighborhoods, whose users and informal proprietors can count to the
utmost in keeping the public spaces of the city safe, in handling
strangers so they are an asset rather than a menace, in keeping casual
public tabs on children in places that are public.

Planning for vitality must combat the destructive presence of border
vacuums, and it must help promote people's identification with city
districts that are large enough, and are varied and rich enough in inner
and outer contacts to deal with the tough, inescapable, practical
problems of big-city life.

Planning for vitality must aim at unslumming the slums, by creating
conditions aimed at persuading a high proportion of the indigenous
residents, whoever they may be, to stay put by choice over time, so
there will be a steadily growing diversity among people and a continuity
of community both for old residents and for newcomers who assimilate
into it.

Planning for vitality must convert the self-destruction of diversity and
other cataclysmic uses of money into constructive forces, by hampering
the opportunities for destructiveness on the one hand, and on the other
hand by stimulating more city territory into possessing a good economic
environment for other people's plans.

Planning for vitality must aim at clarifying the visual order of cities,
and it must do so by both promoting and illuminating functional order,
rather than by obstructing or denying it.

To be sure, this is not quite so formidable as it sounds, because all
such aims are interrelated; it would be impossible to pursue any one of
them effectively without simultaneously (and, to an extent, quite
automatically) pursuing the others. Nevertheless, aims of this kind
cannot be pursued unless those responsible for diagnosis, for devising
tactics, for recommending actions and for carrying out actions know what
they are doing. They must know it not in some generalized way, but in
terms of the precise and unique places in a city with which they are
dealing. Much of what []{#calibre_link-2463 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="410"}they need to know they can learn from no one but the people
of the place, because nobody else knows enough about it.

For this kind of planning, it is not enough for administrators in most
fields to understand specific *services* and *techniques*. They must
understand, and understand thoroughly, specific *places*.

Only supermen could understand a great city as a total, or as whole
groups of districts, in the detail that is needed for guiding
constructive actions and for avoiding unwitting, gratuitous, destructive
actions.

There is a widespread belief among many city experts today that city
problems already beyond the comprehension and control of planners and
other administrators can be solved better if only the territories
involved and problems entailed are made larger still and can therefore
be attacked more "broadly." This is escapism from intellectual
helplessness. "A Region," somebody has wryly said, "is an area safely
larger than the last one to whose problems we found no solution."

::: {#calibre_link-2467 .section_break}

:::

Big-city government is today nothing more than little-city government
which has been stretched and adapted in quite conservative fashion to
handle bigger jobs. This has had strange results, and ultimately
destructive results, because big cities pose operational problems that
are innately different from those posed by little cities.

There are similarities, of course. Like any settlement, a big city has a
territory to be administered, and various services to be administered
for it. And just as in most smaller settlements, it is logical and
practical in big cities to organize these services vertically: that is,
each service has its own organization, e.g., city-wide parks
departments, health departments, traffic departments, housing
authorities, departments of hospitals, departments of water supply,
departments of streets, licensing departments, police departments,
sanitation departments and the like. From time to time new services are
added---departments to combat air pollution, redevelopment agencies,
transit authorities and so on.

However, because of the enormous amount of work these agencies must do
in big cities, even the most traditional have had to make, over the
course of time, numerous internal divisions.

[]{#calibre_link-2472 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="411"}Many of
these divisions are themselves vertical: the agencies are divided
internally into fractions of responsibility, each fraction again
applying to the city as a whole. Thus, for example, departments of parks
are apt to have separate lines of responsibility for forestry,
maintenance, playground design, recreation programs, and so on, coming
together under top commands. Housing authorities have separate lines of
responsibility for site selection and design, maintenance, social
welfare, tenant selection and so on, each line a complex agency in
itself, coming together under top commands. The same is true of boards
of education, welfare departments, planning commissions and so on.

Besides these vertical divisions of responsibility many administrative
agencies also have horizontal divisions: they are divided into
*territorial* segments, for gathering information or for getting the
work done, or both. Thus, for example, we have police precincts, health
districts, welfare districts subadministrative school and park
districts, and so on. In New York, the five territorial borough
presidents' offices have full responsibility over a few services, mainly
streets (but not traffic) and various engineering services.

Each of the many internal divisions of responsibility, vertical or
horizontal, is rational in its own terms, which is to say rational in a
vacuum. Put them all together in terms of a big city itself and the sum
is chaos.

The result is inherently different in a little city, no matter what
internal divisions of services may be made. Consider for a moment such a
city as New Haven, which has only 165,000 people. At this little-city
scale, the head of an administrative agency and his staff members can
easily and naturally communicate and coordinate with administrative
heads and staffs in other services entirely, if they want to. (Whether
they have good ideas to communicate and coordinate is, of course,
another matter.)

Even more important, agency heads and their staffs, at little-city
scale, can be experts in two matters simultaneously: they can be experts
in their own responsibilities, and they can also be experts on the
subject of New Haven itself. The only way an administrator (or anybody
else) gets to know and understand a place well is partly from first-hand
information and observation []{#calibre_link-2477 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="412"}over time, and still more from learning
what other people, both in government and out of government, know about
the place. Some of this information can be mapped or tabulated; some of
it cannot. New Haven is understandable, by combinations of all these
means, to normally bright intellects. There are no other means, either
for the bright or for the stupid, of understanding a locality
intimately.

In short, New Haven, as an administrative structure, has a relative
coherence built right into it, as one factor of its size.

The relative coherence of a place like New Haven is taken for granted,
administratively. There may be ways to improve administrative efficiency
and other facets of performance, but certainly nobody is under the
delusion that the way to do so is to reorganize New Haven so it
possesses one-eighth of a parks department, six and a quarter health
districts, one-third of a welfare district, a thirteenth of a planning
staff, half of one school district, a third of a second school district
and two-ninths of a third school district, two and a half police
departments, and a passing glance from a traffic commissioner.

Under such a scheme as that, even though it has only 165,000 persons,
New Haven would not be understood as a place by anyone responsible. Some
would see only a fraction of it; others would see it whole but only
superficially, as a relatively inconsequential fraction of something
much larger. Nor could its services, including planning, be efficiently
or even sanely administered on such a scheme.

Yet this is the way we try to gather intelligence, administer services
and plan for places within big cities. Naturally, problems which nearly
everyone wants to solve, and which are capable of solution, are out of
everyone's comprehension and control.

Multiply the imaginary fractionation I have outlined for New Haven by
ten or by fifty for cities ranging from populations of one and a half
million to eight million (and remember that the inherent complications
to be understood and handled are increasing, not arithmetically with the
population, but geometrically). Then sort out the differing
responsibilities from their jackstraw disorder in localities, and
combine them into great departmental and bureaucratic empires.

[]{#calibre_link-2484 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="413"}Mazes of
coordination, conference and liaison tenuously connect these sprawling
and randomly fractionated empires with one another. The mazes are too
labyrinthine even to be kept mapped and open, let alone to serve as
reliable and sensitive channels of interdepartmental understanding, or
channels of pooled information about specific places, or channels of
action for getting things done. Citizens and officials both can wander
indefinitely in these labyrinths, passing here and there the bones of
many an old hope, dead of exhaustion.

Thus, in Baltimore, a sophisticated citizens' group, which had the
advantage of inside advice, and which made no false or unnecessary
moves, engaged in conferences, negotiations and series of referrals and
approvals extending over an entire year---merely for permission to place
a sculpture of a bear in a street park! Innately simple achievements
become monumentally difficult in these mazes. Difficult achievements
become impossible.

Consider this item from the *New York Times* in August 1960 about a fire
which had injured six persons in a tenement owned by the city. The
tenement, reports the paper, "had been described as a firetrap in
February in a Fire Department report to the Department of Buildings."
The Commissioner of Buildings, defending his department, said that
building inspectors had been trying to get into the building for a long
time, including the period after May 16 when the city acquired title.
The news story goes on:

> In fact, the Real Estate Department \[the city agency which owned the

> Department official who had not heard about the fire...

If all this inanity concerning sheer communication is too cumbersome,
futile and tedious to follow, consider how much more cumbersome, futile
and tedious it is to contend with. Persons of hope, energy and
initiative who enter into the service of these empires almost have to
become uncaring and resigned, for the sake of their self-preservation
(not for job preservation, as is so often thought, but for
*self*-preservation).

And if useful communication of intelligence and effective coordination
of action are baffling from within the government, consider also how
baffling and frustrating they are for those who must deal with it from
without. Difficult, time consuming---and expensive too---as group
political pressure is to organize and exert on elected officials, the
citizens of big cities learn that this is often the only practicable way
to bypass or undercut still more difficult and time-consuming procedures
of the nonelected
bureaucracy.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-164){#calibre_link-169 .calibre7}

Political action and pressure will always be necessary, and rightly so
in a self-governing society, to battle and settle real conflicts of
interest and opinion. It is another matter to find, as we find today, in
all the biggest cities, that it takes enormous effort---usually never
put forth---merely to bring together and try to interest the appropriate
experts of several different services that are necessarily involved in
handling a single problem or need of a single place. And it is still
more ridiculous that if these "arrangements []{#calibre_link-2492
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="415"}to formulate a liaison"---as they
seem to be called in the New York City Planning Commission---are at last
arranged and formulated, they are apt to be liaisons of expert ignorance
meeting with expert ignorance. You never realize how complicated a
neighborhood within a big city is until you try to explain it to experts
in fractionated responsibility. It is like trying to eat through a
pillow.

Citizens of big cities are forever being berated for not taking
sufficiently active interest in government. It is amazing, rather, that
they keep trying.

Again and again in his penetrating *New York Times* articles on
delinquency, reporter Harrison Salisbury cites the seemingly immovable
obstacles to improvement that are posed by wildly fragmented
information, fragmented administration, fragmented responsibility,
fragmented authority. "The real jungle is in the office of the
bureaucrats," he quotes one student of delinquency. And Salisbury
himself sums up, "Conflict, confusion, overlapping authority are the
order of the day."

It seems to be frequently supposed that this obstructionism and inertia
are deliberate, or are at least the by-products of various nasty
administrative traits. "Hypocrisy," "bureaucratic jealousy," "vested
interest in the status quo," "they don't care," are words and phrases
that constantly crop up in despairing descriptions by citizens, telling
of their frustrations in the labyrinths of city empires. To be sure,
these nasty qualities can be found---they thrive in milieus where it
takes so many to accomplish so little in the face of such need---but
neither personal evil nor orneriness contrives this mess. Saints could
not run such systems well.

The administrative structure itself is at fault *because it has been
adapted beyond the point that mere adaptations can serve*. This is how
human affairs often evolve. There comes a point, at increased levels of
complication, when actual invention is required.

::: {#calibre_link-2497 .section_break}

:::

Cities have made one considerable attempt at invention to deal with this
problem of fragmented administration---the invention of the planning
commission.

In city administrative theory, planning commissions are the
[]{#calibre_link-2500 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="416"}grand
administrative coordinators. They are rather new as significant features
of American city government, most of them having been instituted only
within the past twenty-five years as a direct response to the glaringly
obvious fact that city administrative departments are unable to
coordinate various schemes entailing city physical changes.

The invention was a poor one for the reason that it duplicated, and in
some ways reinforced, the very flaws it was intended to overcome.

Planning commissions are organized, just as the other bureaucratic
empires are, in fundamentally vertical fashion, with vertical
fractionated responsibility and, as need and expediency have dictated,
into random horizontal divisions here and there (renewal districts,
conservation areas, etc.), coming together under top commands. Under
this arrangement, it still remains that nobody, including the planning
commission, is capable of comprehending places within the city other
than in either generalized or fragmented fashion.

Furthermore, as coordinators of the physical plans of other city
agencies, planning commissions deal mainly with proposals only *after*
the officials of other agencies have at least tentatively figured out
what they want to do. From dozens of sources these proposals come to the
ken of the planning commission, which is *then* supposed to see whether
they make sense in light of each other and in light of the planning
commission's own information, conceptions and visions. But the vital
time for coordinating intelligence is before and during the time that
even tentative proposals are conceived or tactics worked out for any
specific service in any specific place.

Naturally, under a system as unrealistic as this, the coordinators are
unable to coordinate, even for themselves, let alone for others.
Philadelphia's planning commission is widely admired as one of the best
in the country, and it probably is, considering. But when one attempts
to find out why the planning commission's pet esthetic creations, the
Greenway "promenades,"[\*^3^](#calibre_link-165){#calibre_link-170
.calibre7} do not have the physical appearance in reality that they had
in the planners' renderings, one learns from the planning director
himself that the []{#calibre_link-2505 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="417"}department of streets did not get the idea or something, and
has not provided the proper pavements, the parks department or the
housing authority or the redeveloper did not get the idea or something,
and has not done right with the abstract open spaces, the many city
departments concerned with street furniture did not get the idea or
something---and above all, the citizens do not get the idea or
something. All these details are so wearying and frustrating, it is more
rewarding to create new visions of what might "ideally" be for some
other place than it is to wander the labyrinths trying futilely to put
together the pieces of last year's vision. Yet these are innately simple
matters compared with the coordination required to attack such really
tough planning problems as unslumming, safety, clarifying the order of
cities, and better economic environment for diversity.

Under the circumstances, planning commissions have become, not effective
instruments for comprehending and coordinating a necessary infinity of
complex city detail, but rather destructive instruments, of greater or
lesser effectiveness, for "unbuilding" and oversimplifying cities. It
cannot be helped, as things are. Their staffs do not and cannot know
enough about places within cities to do anything else, try as they
might. Even should their ideologies of planning switch from Radiant
Garden City Beautiful visions to *city* planning, they could not do city
planning. They do not even have the means of gathering and comprehending
the intimate, many-sided information required, partly because of their
own unsuitable structures for comprehending big cities, and partly
because of the same structural inadequacies in other departments.

Here is an interesting thing about coordination both of information and
of action in cities, and it is the crux of the matter: The principal
coordination needed comes down to coordination among different services
within localized places. This is at once the most difficult kind of
coordination, and the most necessary. Coordination up and down the line
of fractionated vertical responsibilities is simple in comparison, and
less vital too. Yet vertical coordination is made easiest by the
administrative structure, and all other kinds more difficult, with
locality coordination made impossible.

Intellectually, the importance of locality coordination is little
[]{#calibre_link-2509 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="418"}recognized
or acknowledged in city administrative theory. Planning commissions
themselves are again a prime case in point. Planners like to think they
deal in grand terms with the city as a whole, and that their value is
great because they "grasp the whole picture." But the notion that they
are needed to deal with their city "as a whole" is principally a
delusion. Aside from highway planning (which is done abominably, in part
because nobody understands the localities involved), and the almost
purely budgetary responsibility for rationalizing and allocating the sum
of capital improvement expenditures presented in tentative budgets, the
work of city planning commissions and their staffs seldom deals, in
truth, with a big city as a total organism.

In truth, because of the nature of the work to be done, almost all city
planning is concerned with relatively small and specific acts done here
and done there, in specific streets, neighborhoods and districts. To
know whether it is done well or ill---to know what should be done at
all---it is more important to know that specific locality than it is to
know how many bits in the same category of bits are going into other
localities and what is being done with them there. No other expertise
can substitute for locality knowledge in planning, whether the planning
is creative, coordinating or predictive.

::: {#calibre_link-2511 .section_break}

:::

The invention required is not a device for coordination at the
generalized top, but rather an invention to make coordination possible
where the need is most acute---in specific and unique localties.

In short, great cities must be divided into administrative districts.
These would be horizontal divisions of city government but, unlike
random horizontality, they would be common to the municipal government
as a whole. The administrative districts would represent the primary,
basic subdivisions made within most city agencies.

The chief officials of an agency, below the top commissioner, should be
district administrators. Each district administrator would supervise all
aspects of his department's service within his district; working under
him would be the staff for supplying his service to the locality. The
same district boundaries would be []{#calibre_link-2515 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="419"}common to each department which acts
directly on district life or planning---such as traffic, welfare,
schools, police, parks, code enforcement, health, housing subsidy, fire,
zoning, planning.

That district, as well as his own service, would be each district
administrator's specific business. This double knowledge is not too much
for normally bright intellects---particularly when districts include
other men and women looking at the same place from other angles, and
also responsible for understanding and serving the place as a place.

These administrative districts would have to correspond with reality,
instead of fragmenting it under a new device. They would have to
correspond with districts that now operate---or can potentially
operate---as social and political Things in the manner described in
[Chapter Six](#calibre_link-15){.calibre7}.

With this kind of framework of governmental intelligence and action at
hand, we could expect that many city-wide voluntary agencies of public
service would also adapt themselves to district administration.

The idea of horizontal municipal administration is, as already
indicated, not a new idea. There are precedents for it in the random,
unreconciled horizontality already resorted to by much city
administration. There are precedents also in the designations, which
have become common today, of renewal or conservation districts. When New
York began to try neighborhood conservation in a handful of places, the
administrators of this program promptly discovered they could get
nothing useful done unless they made special and exceptional
arrangements with at least the buildings department, the fire
department, the police department, the health department and the
sanitation department to supply staff members specifically responsible
for that *place*. This has been necessary merely to coordinate a modicum
of improvement in the simplest matters. The city describes this
arrangement of reconciled horizontality as "a department store of
services for the neighborhood," and it is recognized by both the city
itself and the citizens concerned as one of the chief benefits received
by a neighborhood which is declared a conservation area!

Among the most telling precedents for horizontal administration and
responsibility are the settlement houses of big cities,
[]{#calibre_link-2521 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="420"}which have
always organized themselves with a piece of territory as their prime
concern, rather than as a disembodied collection of vertical services.
This is a main reason why settlement houses have been so effective, why
their staffs usually know a place as thoroughly as they know their jobs,
and why settlement house services, as a rule, neither become obsolescent
nor work at cross-purposes to one another. Different settlement houses
in a big city typically work together to quite a degree---fund raising,
finding personnel, exchanging ideas, pressuring for legislation---and in
this sense they are more than horizontal organizations. They are
simultaneously horizontal and vertical, in effect, but structurally the
coordination is made easiest where inherently it is hardest.

Nor is the idea of administrative districts for American cities new,
either. It has been proposed from time to time by citizens' groups---in
New York it was suggested in 1947 by the competent and well-informed
Citizens' Union, which went so far as actually to map out feasible
administrative districts, based on empirical city districts; the
Citizens' Union district map remains to this day the most understandable
and logical mapping of New York City.

Usually, suggestions of big-city district administration wander off
along unprofitable intellectual trails, however, and I think this is one
reason they get nowhere. They are sometimes conceived of, for example,
as organs of formalized "advice" to government. But in real life,
advisory bodies lacking authority and responsibility are worse than
useless for district administration. They waste everyone's time and
inevitably succeed no better than anyone else in threading the
impossible labyrinths of fractionated bureaucratic empires. Or
administrative districts are sometimes conceived of in terms of a single
"kingpin" service, such as planning for example, and this too turns
ineffectual for solving anything of much importance; for to work
usefully as instruments of government, administrative districts must
encompass the many-sided activities of government. And sometimes the
idea gets diverted into the aim of building local "civic centers," so
that its importance is confused with the superficial aim of providing a
new kind of project ornament for cities. The offices of district
administration would have to be within the district concerned, and they
should be close together. However, the virtue of this arrangement
[]{#calibre_link-2524 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="421"}is hardly
anything visible or materially impressive. The most important visible
manifestation of district administration would be the sight of people
talking together without having first had "arrangements to formulate a
liaison."

District administration, as a form of municipal government structure, is
inherently more complex than the adapted little-city administrative
structures we now have. City administration needs to be more complex in
its fundamental structure so it can *work* more simply. The present
structures, paradoxically, are fundamentally too simple.

For it must be understood that district administration in big cities
cannot be "pure" or doctrinaire, with the vertical connections
forgotten. A city, however big, is still a city, with great
interdependence among its places and its parts. It is not a collection
of towns and if it were it would be destroyed as a city.

Doctrinaire reorganization of government into pure horizontal
administration would be as fatally simple and as chaotically unworkable
as the present messes. It would be impractical if for no other reason
than that taxation and the overall allocation of funds must be
centralized city functions. Furthermore, some city operations transcend
district administration completely; intimate and intricate details of
district knowledge are largely irrelevant to them, and those that are
relevant could be easily and quickly comprehended by gathering the
necessary intelligence from district administrators who do understand
the place. Water supply, air pollution control, labor mediation,
management of museums, zoos and prisons are examples. Even within some
departments, some services are illogical as district functions while
others are logical; for instance, it would be foolish for a department
of licenses to dispense taxi licenses as a district function, but
second-hand dealers, places of entertainment, vendors, key makers,
employment agencies, and many other operations requiring licenses would
be sensibly dealt with under district organization.

In addition, certain specialists can be afforded by big cities and can
be useful to them, although they would not be needed constantly in any
one administrative district. Such people can serve as roving technicians
and experts within a service, *under* the district administrator to whom
they are assigned as needed.

[]{#calibre_link-2530 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="422"}A city
instituting district administration should attempt to convert every
service to which district knowledge is relevant into this new kind of
structural organization. However, for some services, and portions of
services, it would be necessary to see how it worked. Various
adjustments could be made. The system does not need to be preceded by a
copper-riveted, immutable scheme of operation. Indeed to put it into
effect, and to make changes after it was in effect, would require no
more formal powers than are now required when services make their
hit-and-miss adaptations of organization. What would be needed to put it
in force would be a strong mayor with a convinced belief in popular
government (the two usually go together).

In short, vertical city-wide service departments would still exist and
would internally pool information and ideas among districts. But in
nearly all cases, the internal organizations of varying services would
be rationalized and automatically matched up with one another, to make
innate functional sense with respect to both their dealings among
themselves and their dealings with localities. In the case of planning,
a city planning service would exist, but nearly all its staff (and, let
us hope, its brightest staff) would be serving the city in decentralized
fashion, in administrative districts, at the only scale where planning
for city vitality can be comprehended, coordinated and carried out.

Administrative districts in a big city would promptly begin to act as
political creatures, because they would possess real organs of
information, recommendation, decision and action. This would be one of
the chief advantages of the system.

Citizens of big cities need fulcrum points where they can apply their
pressures, and make their wills and their knowledge known and respected.
Administrative districts would inevitably become such fulcrum points.
Many of the conflicts that are today fought out in the labyrinths of
vertical city government---or that are decided by default because the
citizens never know what hit them---would be transferred to these
district arenas. This is necessary for big-city self-government, whether
self-government is considered as a creative or as a supervisory process
(of course it is both). The larger, the more impersonal, the more
incomprehensible big-city []{#calibre_link-2535 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="423"}government becomes, and the more blurred in
the total localized issues, needs and problems become, the more
attenuated and ineffectual becomes either citizen action or citizen
supervision. It is futile to expect that citizens will act with
responsibility, verve and experience on big, city-wide issues when
self-government has been rendered all but impossible on localized
issues, which are often of the most direct importance to people.

As a political creature, an administrative district would need a head
man, and would certainly get one, either formally or informally. A
formal means, and on paper the neatest, might be to appoint a deputy
"mayor," responsible to the city mayor. However, an appointive official
as *head man* would soon be undercut by an elected official of some
sort, for the simple reason that groups of citizens will always apply
their pressures on an elected official if they can---and back him up
with their support if he comes through---when they are maneuvering to
get administration to see things their way. Voters, perceiving
alternatives for applying their influence, are intelligent enough to use
their power where it has a handle. Almost inevitably, some elected
official with a constituency corresponding at least roughly to the
district would become, in function, a sort of local "mayor." This is
what happens now wherever big-city districts are socially and
politically effective.[\*^4^](#calibre_link-166){#calibre_link-171
.calibre7}

What is the right size for an administrative district?

Geographically, empirical city districts that work effectively as
[]{#calibre_link-2539 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="424"}districts
are seldom larger than about a mile and a half square in area, and they
are usually smaller.

However, there is at least one striking exception to this, and it may be
significant. The Back-of-the-Yards district in Chicago is roughly one
and a half by three miles, about twice maximum size for an effective
district, according to evidence of other places.

In effect, the Back-of-the-Yards already operates as an administrative
district, not formally or theoretically, but in fact. In the
Back-of-the-Yards, the local government that counts most, as government,
is not the generalized city government but rather the Back-of-the-Yards
Council, which I described briefly in [Chapter
Sixteen](#calibre_link-27){.calibre7}. Decisions of the kind that can be
carried out only under the formal powers of government are transmitted
by the Council to the city government, which is, shall we say, extremely
responsive. In addition, the Council itself provides some services
which, if provided at all, are apt customarily to be provided by formal
government.

It may be this ability of the Back-of-the-Yards to function as a true,
though informal, unit of governmental power that makes possible its
untypically large geographic size. In short, effective district
identity, which usually depends almost wholly on internal cross-use for
its foundation, has the reinforcement here of solid governmental
organization.

This could be significant for the areas of big cities where residence is
one of the chief primary uses, but where densities are too low to
reconcile sufficient numbers of people with usual, viable district area.
In time, such areas ought gradually to be brought up to city
concentration of use, and eventually a single geographically large area
like this might become a couple of districts; but in the meantime, if
the Back-of-the-Yards clue means what I think it means, the cohesion
introduced by district administration might make it possible for these
too-thin areas to operate as districts politically and socially, as well
as administratively.

Outside of downtowns, or of huge manufacturing constellations, residence
is almost always one of the main primary uses of a city district;
population size is thus important in considering district size. In
[Chapter Six](#calibre_link-15){.calibre7}, on city neighborhoods,
empirically useful []{#calibre_link-2545 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="425"}districts were defined as places big enough (in population)
to swing weight in the city as a whole, but small enough so that street
neighborhoods were not lost or ignored. This might vary from as little
as 30,000 people in cities like Boston and Baltimore to a minimum of
about 100,000 in the largest cities, with a possible maximum of about
200,000. I think 30,000 is low for efficient district administration;
50,000 would be a more realistic minimum. The maximum of about 200,000
holds for administration, however, as it does for a district considered
as a social and political organ, because anything much larger than that
exceeds a unit that can be comprehended both whole and in sufficient
detail.

Big cities have become, in themselves, only parts of still larger units
of settlement, known in the census figures as Standard Metropolitan
Areas. A Standard Metropolitan Area includes a major city (sometimes
more, as in the New York-Newark or San Francisco-Oakland Standard
Metropolitan Areas for example), along with the related towns, smaller
satellite cities, villages and suburbs that lie outside a major city's
political boundaries but within its economic and social orbit. The size
of Standard Metropolitan Areas, both geographically and in population,
has of course been growing extraordinarily in the past fifteen years.
This is partly because of cataclysmic money that has flooded city
outskirts and starved cities as explained in [Chapter
Sixteen](#calibre_link-27){.calibre7}, partly because big cities have
failed to work well enough as *cities,* and partly because suburban and
semisuburban growth from these two reasons has engulfed formerly
discrete villages and towns.

Many problems, particularly planning problems, are common to these
governmentally separate settlements of a metropolitan area. This---not
the big city---is the unit that means most with respect to overcoming
water pollution, or major transportation problems, or major land waste
and misuse, or conservation of water tables, wild land, big recreation
sites and other resources.

Because these real and important problems exist, and because we have,
administratively, no very good ways of getting at them, a concept called
"Metropolitan Government" has been developed. Under Metropolitan
Government, politically separate localities would continue to have a
political identity and autonomy in []{#calibre_link-2550 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="426"}purely local concerns, but they would be
federated into a super-area government which would have extensive
planning powers and administrative organs for carrying the plans into
action. Part of the taxes from each locality would go to the
Metropolitan Government, thus helping also to relieve great cities of
part of the financial burden they carry, unrecompensed, for major
central city facilities used by the hinterland. Political boundaries, as
barriers to joint planning and joint support of common metropolitan
facilities, would thus, it is reasoned, be overcome.

Metropolitan Government is a popular idea not only with many planners;
it seems to have appealed to numerous big businessmen, who explain in
many a speech that this is the rational way to handle the "business of
government." Advocates of Metropolitan Governmnent have standard
exhibits to show how impossible metropolitan area planning is at
present. These exhibits are political maps of greater metropolitan
areas. Somewhere near the center is a conspicuously large, neat entity,
representing the government of the largest city involved, the
metropolis. Outside it is a welter of overlapping, duplicating,
strangulated, town, county, small-city and township governments,
together with all manner of special administrative districts evolved by
expediency, some of them overlapping the big city.

The Chicago metropolitan area, for instance, has about a thousand
different contiguous or overlapping local government units, in addition
to the municipal government of Chicago itself. In 1957, our 174
metropolitan areas contained a mélange of 16,210 separate units of
government.

"Government crazy quilt" is the standard description, and it is in some
ways an apt one. The moral drawn is that crazy quilts like these cannot
function sensibly; they provide no workable basis either for
metropolitan planning or action.

Every so often in a metropolitan area, Metropolitan Government is put up
to the voters. The voters inexorably and invariably turn it
down.[\*^5^](#calibre_link-167){#calibre_link-172 .calibre7}

[]{#calibre_link-2556 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="427"}The voters
are right, in spite of the fact that there is great need for common and
coordinated action (and financial support) on many metropolitan area
problems, and still more need for localized coordination here and there
among different governmental units within a metropolitan area. The
voters are right because in real life we lack strategies and tactics for
making large-scale metropolitan government and planning work.

The maps that are supposed to explain the situation as it exists contain
a monstrous fiction. The conspicuously neat, clean entity representing
the "unified" government of the major metropolis is, of course, an
administrative crazy quilt even madder than that formed by the
governmental fragments that lie outside it.

The voters sensibly decline to federate into a system where bigness
means local helplessness, ruthless, oversimplified planning, and
administrative chaos---for that is just what municipal bigness means
today. How is helplessness against "conquering" planners an improvement
over no planning? How is bigger administration, with labyrinths nobody
can comprehend or navigate, an improvement over crazy-quilt township and
suburban governments?

We already have governmental units which cry out for new and workable
strategies and tactics of big metropolitan administration and planning,
and these are the great cities themselves. Workable metropolitan
administration has to be learned and used, first, *within* big cities,
where no fixed political boundaries prevent its use. This is where we
must experiment with methods for solving big common problems without, as
a corollary, wreaking gratuitous mayhem on localities and on the
processes of self-government.

If great cities can learn to administer, coordinate and plan in terms of
administrative districts at understandable scale, we may become
competent, as a society, to deal too with those crazy quilts of
government and administration in the greater metropolitan areas. Today
we are not competent to do so. We have no practice or wisdom in handling
big metropolitan administration or planning, except in the form of
constantly more inadequate adaptations of little-city government.

[\*^1^](#calibre_link-168){.calibre7} Thus in a letter to the *New York
Times* on charter revision, Stanley M. Isaacs, City Councilman and
former Borough President of Manhattan, writes: "Will they hold hearings?
Of course. But we who are experienced know what that means. These will
be hearings like those regularly held these days by the Board of
Estimate. They will hold an executive session first"; \[executive
sessions are on Wednesdays, the day before public hearings\] "everything
will be decided; and then the public will be listened to with complete
courtesy and with deaf ears."

[\*^2^](#calibre_link-169){.calibre7} Special interests sometimes hire
"influence" to overcome---in their own interest of course---frustrations
similar to those that impel ordinary citizens to exert group leverage on
administrators via elected officials. Thus one aspect of New York's
urban redevelopment scandals concerned payments made to Sydney S. Baron
(press chief of Democratic Party leader Carmine G. DeSapio) by six
sponsors of federally subsidized redevelopment projects. One of the
sponsors explained, according to the *New York Post*, "It would be
fantastic to tell you we hired Baron for any other reason than his
influence. We would wait months for meetings with Commissioners---like
the Health, Fire and Police Departments---but then he would go to the
phone and, immediately, we would have action." The news report goes on
to say, "Baron flatly denied that he was primarily hired to 'expedite
with city agencies.' 'I only set up two conferences, one with Health,
one with Fire,' he said."

[\*^3^](#calibre_link-170){.calibre7} Which of course have no
promenaders.

[\*^4^](#calibre_link-171){.calibre7} Local "mayors" in this sense seem
to evolve as a combination of two factors: their own accessibility and
success in delivering what is asked, and their scale of constituency.
Because of the first factor, the formal offices they hold are likely to
differ within a single city. But the second factor is important too.
Thus, although in many cities councilmen are apt to be local "mayors,"
this is unusual in New York, where city councilmen's constituencies
(about 300,000 people) are too big for the purpose; instead, local
"mayors" are more frequently state assemblymen who, purely because of
the circumstance that they have the smallest scale of constituencies in
the city (about 115,000 people) are typically called upon to deal with
the city government. Good state assemblymen in New York City deal much
more with the city government on behalf of the citizens than they do
with the state; they are sometimes vital in this way as city officials,
although this is entirely aside from their theoretical responsibilities.
It is an outcome of district political make-do.

[\*^5^](#calibre_link-172){.calibre7} With the exception of voters in
the Miami metropolitan area. However, in order to get Metropolitan
Government accepted there, its proponents put so little power in the
hands of the Metropolitan Government that what was voted in was little
more than a gesture.

# The kind of problem a city is {#calibre_link-2566 .chaphead1}
:::

Thinking has its strategies and tactics too, much as other forms of
action have. Merely to think about cities and get somewhere, one of the
main things to know is what *kind* of problem cities pose, for all
problems cannot be thought about in the same way. Which avenues of
thinking are apt to be useful and to help yield the truth depends not on
how we might prefer to think about a subject, but rather on the inherent
nature of the subject itself.

Among the many revolutionary changes of this century, perhaps those that
go deepest are the changes in the mental methods we can use for probing
the world. I do not mean new mechanical brains, but methods of analysis
and discovery that have gotten into human brains: new strategies for
thinking. These have developed mainly as methods of science. But the
mental awakenings and intellectual daring they represent are gradually
beginning to affect other kinds of inquiry too. Puzzles that once
appeared un-analyzable become more susceptible to attack. What is more,
the []{#calibre_link-2569 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="429"}very
nature of some puzzles are no longer what they once seemed.

To understand what these changes in strategies of thought have to do
with cities, it is necessary to understand a little about the history of
scientific thought. A splendid summary and interpretation of this
history is included in an essay on science and complexity in the 1958
*Annual Report of the Rockefeller Foundation,* written by Dr. Warren
Weaver upon his retirement as the foundation's Vice-President for the
Natural and Medical Sciences. I shall quote from this essay at some
length, because what Dr. Weaver says has direct pertinence to thought
about cities. His remarks sum up, in an oblique way, virtually the
intellectual history of city planning.

Dr. Weaver lists three stages of development in the history of
scientific thought: (1) ability to deal with problems of simplicity; (2)
ability to deal with problems of disorganized complexity; and (3)
ability to deal with problems of organized complexity.

Problems of simplicity are problems that contain two factors which are
directly related to each other in their behavior---two variables---and
these problems of simplicity, Dr. Weaver points out, were the first
*kinds* of problems that science learned to attack:

> Speaking roughly, one may say that the seventeenth, eighteenth and
> nineteenth centuries formed the period in which physical science

It was not until after 1900 that a second method of analyzing problems
was developed by the physical sciences.

Some imaginative minds \[Dr. Weaver continues\] rather than studying
problems which involved two variables or at most three or four, went to
the other extreme, and said, "Let us develop analytical methods which
can deal with two billion variables." That is to say, the physical
scientists (with the mathematicians often in the vanguard) developed
powerful techniques of probability theory and of statistical mechanics
which can deal with what we may call problems of *disorganized
complexity*...

Consider first a simple illustration in order to get the flavor of the
idea. The classical dynamics of the nineteenth century was well suited
for analyzing and predicting the motion of a single ivory ball as it
moves about on a billiard table...One can, but with a surprising
increase in difficulty, analyze the motion of two or even three balls on
a billiard table...But as soon as one tries to analyze the motion of ten
or fifteen balls on the table at once, as in pool, the problem becomes
unmanageable, not because there is any theoretical difficulty, but just
because the actual labor of dealing in specific detail with so many
variables turns out to be impractical.

Imagine, however, a large billiard table with millions of balls flying
about on its surface...The great surprise is that the problem now
becomes easier: the methods of statistical mechanics are now applicable.
One cannot trace the detailed history of one special ball, to be sure;
but there can be answered with useful precision such important questions
as: On the average how many balls per second hit a given stretch of
rail? On the average how far does a ball move before it is hit by some
other ball?...

...The word "disorganized" \[applies\] to the large billiard table with
the many balls...because the balls are distributed, in their positions
and motions, in a helter-skelter way...But []{#calibre_link-2583
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="431"}in spite of this helter-skelter
or unknown behavior of all the individual variables, the system as a
whole possesses certain orderly and analyzable average properties...

A wide range of experience comes under this label of disorganized
complexity...It applies with entirely useful precision to the experience
of a large telephone exchange, predicting the average frequency of
calls, the probability of overlapping calls of the same number, etc. It
makes possible the financial stability of a life insurance company...The
motions of the atoms which form all matter, as well as the motions of
the stars which form the universe, all come under the range of these new
techniques. The fundamental laws of heredity are analyzed by them. The
laws of thermodynamics, which describe basic and inevitable tendencies
of all physical systems, are derived from statistical considerations.
The whole structure of modern physics...rests on these statistical
concepts. Indeed, the whole question of evidence, and the way in which
knowledge can be inferred from evidence, is now recognized to depend on
these same ideas...We have also come to realize that communication
theory and information theory are similarly based upon statistical
ideas. One is thus bound to say that probability notions are essential
to any theory of knowledge itself.

However, by no means all problems could be probed by this method of
analysis. The life sciences, such as biology and medicine, could not be,
as Dr. Weaver points out. These sciences, too, had been making advances,
but on the whole they were still concerned with what Dr. Weaver calls
preliminary stages for application of analysis; they were concerned with
collection, description, classification, and observation of apparently
correlated effects. During this preparatory stage, among the many useful
things that were learned was that the life sciences were neither
problems of simplicity nor problems of disorganized complexity; they
inherently posed still a different kind of problem, a kind of problem
for which methods of attack were still very backward as recently as
1932, says Dr. Weaver.

Describing this gap, he writes:

In 1932, when the life sciences were just at the threshold of developing
effective analytical methods for handling organized complexity, it was
speculated, Dr. Weaver tells us, that if the life sciences could make
significant progress in such problems, "then there might be
opportunities to extend these new techniques, if only by helpful
analogy, into vast areas of the behavioral and social sciences."

In the quarter-century since that time, the life sciences have indeed
made immense and brilliant progress. They have accumulated, with
extraordinary swiftness, an extraordinary quantity of hitherto hidden
knowledge. They have also acquired vastly improved bodies of theory and
procedure---enough to open up great new questions, and to show that only
a start has been made on what there is to know.

But this progesss has been possible only because the life sciences were
recognized to be problems in organized complexity, and were thought of
and attacked in ways suitable to understanding that *kind* of problem.

The recent progress of the life sciences tells us something tremendously
[]{#calibre_link-2596 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="433"}important
about other problems of organized complexity. It tells us that problems
of this *kind* can be analyzed---that it is only sensible to regard them
as capable of being understood, instead of considering them, as Dr.
Weaver puts it, to be "in some dark and foreboding way, irrational."

Now let us see what this has to do with cities.

Cities happen to be problems in organized complexity, like the life
sciences. They present "situations in which a half-dozen or even several
dozen quantities are all varying simultaneously *and in subtly
interconnected ways.*" Cities, again like the life sciences, do not
exhibit *one* problem in organized complexity, which if understood
explains all. They can be analyzed into many such problems or segments
which, as in the case of the life sciences, are also related with one
another. The variables are many, but they are not helter-skelter; they
are "interrelated into an organic whole."

Consider again, as an illustration, the problem of a city neighborhood
park. Any single factor about the park is slippery as an eel; it can
potentially mean any number of things, depending on how it is acted upon
by other factors and how it reacts to them. How much the park is used
depends, in part, upon the park's own design. But even this partial
influence of the park's design upon the park's use depends, in turn, on
who is around to use the park, and when, and this in turn depends on
uses of the city outside the park itself. Furthermore, the influence of
these uses on the park is only partly a matter of how each affects the
park independently of the others; it is also partly a matter of how they
affect the park in combination with one another, for certain
combinations stimulate the degree of influence from one another among
their components. In turn, these city uses near the park and their
combinations depend on still other factors, such as the mixture of age
in buildings, the size of blocks in the vicinity, and so on, including
the presence of the park itself as a common and unifying use in its
context. Increase the park's size considerably, or else change its
design in such a way that it severs and disperses users from the streets
about it, instead of uniting and mixing them, and all bets are off. New
sets of influence come into play, both in the park and in its
surroundings. This is a far cry from the simple []{#calibre_link-2600
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="434"}problem of ratios of open space
to ratios of population; but there is no use wishing it were a simpler
problem or trying to make it a simpler problem, because in real life it
is not a simpler problem. No matter what you try to do to it, a city
park *behaves* like a problem in organized complexity, and that is what
it is. The same is true of all other parts or features of cities.
Although the interrelations of their many factors are complex, there is
nothing accidental or irrational about the ways in which these factors
affect each other.

Moreover, in parts of cities which are working well in some respects and
badly in others (as is often the case), we cannot even analyze the
virtues and the faults, diagnose the trouble or consider helpful
changes, without going at them as problems of organized complexity. To
take a few simplified illustrations, a street may be functioning
excellently at the supervision of children and at producing a casual and
trustful public life, but be doing miserably at solving all other
problems because it has failed at knitting itself with an effective
larger community, which in turn may or may not exist because of still
other sets of factors. Or a street may have, in itself, excellent
physical material for generating diversity and an admirable physical
design for casual surveillance of public spaces, and yet because of its
proximity to a dead border, it may be so empty of life as to be shunned
and feared even by its own residents. Or a street may have little
foundation for workability on its own merits, yet geographically tie in
so admirably with a district that is workable and vital that this
circumstance is enough to sustain its attraction and give it use and
sufficient workability. We may wish for easier, all-purpose analyses,
and for simpler, magical, all-purpose cures, but wishing cannot change
these problems into simpler matters than organized complexity, no matter
how much we try to evade the realities and to handle them as something
different.

Why have cities not, long since, been identified, understood and treated
as problems of organized complexity? If the people concerned with the
life sciences were able to identify their difficult problems as problems
of organized complexity, why have people professionally concerned with
cities not identified the *kind* of problem they had?

[]{#calibre_link-2604 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="435"}The history
of modern thought about cities is unfortunately very different from the
history of modern thought about the life sciences. The theorists of
conventional modern city planning have consistently mistaken cities as
problems of simplicity and of disorganized complexity, and have tried to
analyze and treat them thus. No doubt this imitation of the physical
sciences was hardly conscious. It was probably derived, as the
assumptions behind most thinking are, from the general floating fund of
intellectual spores around at the time. However, I think these
misapplications could hardly have occurred, and certainly would not have
been perpetuated as they have been, without great disrespect for the
subject matter itself---cities. These misapplications stand in our way;
they have to be hauled out in the light, recognized as inapplicable
strategies of thought, and discarded.

Garden City planning theory had its beginnings in the late nineteenth
century, and Ebenezer Howard attacked the problem of town planning much
as if he were a nineteenth-century physical scientist analyzing a
two-variable problem of simplicity. The two major variables in the
Garden City concept of planning were the quantity of housing (or
population) and the number of jobs. These two were conceived of as
simply and directly related to each other, in the form of relatively
closed systems. In turn, the housing had its subsidiary variables,
related to it in equally direct, simple, mutually independent form:
playgrounds, open space, schools, community center, standardized
supplies and services. The town as a whole was conceived of, again, as
one of the two variables in a direct, simple, town-greenbelt
relationship. As a system of order, that is about all there was to it.
And on this simple base of two-variable relationships was created an
entire theory of self-contained towns as a means of redistributing the
population of cities and (hopefully) achieving regional planning.

Whatever may be said of this scheme for isolated towns, any such simple
systems of two-variable relationships cannot possibly be discerned in
great cities---and never could be. Such systems cannot be discerned in a
town either, the day after the town becomes encompassed in a
metropolitan orbit with its multiplicity of choices and complexities of
cross-use. But in spite of this fact, planning theory has persistently
applied this two-variable *system []{#calibre_link-2607 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="436"}of thinking and analyzing* to big cities;
and to this day city planners and housers believe they hold a precious
nugget of truth about the *kind* of problem to be dealt with when they
attempt to shape or reshape big-city neighborhoods into versions of
two-variable systems, with ratios of one thing (as open space) depending
directly and simply upon an immediate ratio of something else (as
population).[\*^1^](#calibre_link-173){#calibre_link-175 .calibre7}

To be sure, while planners were assuming that cities were properly
problems of simplicity, planning theorists and planners could not avoid
seeing that real cities were not so in fact. But they took care of this
in the traditional way that the incurious (or the disrespectful) have
always regarded problems of organized complexity: as if these puzzles
were, in Dr. Weaver's words, "in some dark and foreboding way,
irrational."

Beginning in the late 1920's in Europe, and in the 1930's here, city
planning theory began to assimilate the newer ideas on probability
theory developed by physical science. Planners began to imitate and
apply these analyses precisely as if cities were problems in
disorganized complexity, understandable purely by statistical analysis,
predictable by the application of probability mathematics, manageable by
conversion into groups of averages.

This conception of the city as a collection of separate file drawers, in
effect, was suited very well by the Radiant City vision of Le Corbusier,
that vertical and more centralized version of the two-variable Garden
City. Although Le Corbusier himself made no more than a gesture toward
statistical analysis, his scheme assumed the statistical reordering of a
system of disorganized complexity, solvable mathematically; his towers
in the park were a celebration, in art, of the potency of statistics and
the triumph of the mathematical average.

The new probability techniques, and the assumptions about the *kind* of
problem that underlay the way they have been used in city planning, did
not supplant the base idea of the two-variable reformed city. Rather
these new ideas were added. Simple, two-variable systems of order were
still the aim. But these could be organized even more "rationally" now,
from out of a supposed existing system of disorganized complexity. In
short, the new []{#calibre_link-2612 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="437"}probability and statistical methods gave more "accuracy,"
more scope, made possible a more Olympian view and treatment of the
supposed problem of the city.

With the probability techniques, an old aim---stores "properly" related
to immediate housing or to a preordained population---became seemingly
feasible; there arose techniques for planning standardized shopping
"scientifically"; although it was early realized by such planning
theorists as Stein and Bauer that preplanned shopping centers within
cities must also be monopolistic or semimonopolistic, or else the
statistics would not predict, and the city would go on behaving with
dark and foreboding irrationality.

With these techniques, it also became feasible to analyze statistically,
by income groups and family sizes, a given quantity of people uprooted
by acts of planning, to combine these with probability statistics on
normal housing turnover, and to estimate accurately the gap. Thus arose
the supposed feasibility of large-scale relocation of citizens. In the
form of statistics, these citizens were no longer components of any unit
except the family, and could be dealt with intellectually like grains of
sand, or electrons or billiard balls. The larger the number of uprooted,
the more easily they could be planned for on the basis of mathematical
averages. On this basis it was actually intellectually easy and sane to
contemplate clearance of all slums and re-sorting of people in ten years
and not much harder to contemplate it as a twenty-year job.

By carrying to logical conclusions the thesis that the city, as it
exists, is a problem in disorganized complexity, housers and planners
reached---apparently with straight faces---the idea that almost any
specific malfunctioning could be corrected by opening and filling a new
file drawer. Thus we get such political party policy statements as this:
"The Housing Act of 1959...should be supplemented to include...a program
of housing for moderate-income families whose incomes are too high for
admission to public housing, but too low to enable them to obtain decent
shelter in the private market."

With statistical and probability techniques, it also became possible to
create formidable and impressive planning surveys for
[]{#calibre_link-2617 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="438"}cities---surveys that come out with fanfare, are read by
practically nobody, and then drop quietly into oblivion, as well they
might, being nothing more nor less than routine exercises in statistical
mechanics for systems of disorganized complexity. It became possible
also to map out master plans for the statistical city, and people take
these more seriously, for we are all accustomed to believe that maps and
reality are necessarily related, or that if they are not, we can make
them so by altering reality.

With these techniques, it was possible not only to conceive of people,
their incomes, their spending money and their housing as fundamentally
problems in disorganized complexity, susceptible to conversion into
problems of simplicity once ranges and averages were worked out, but
also to conceive of city traffic, industry, parks, and even cultural
facilities as components of disorganized complexity, convertible into
problems of simplicity.

Furthermore, it was no intellectual disadvantage to contemplate
"coordinated" schemes of city planning embracing ever greater
territories. The greater the territory, as well as the larger the
population, the more rationally and easily could both be dealt with as
problems of disorganized complexity viewed from an Olympian vantage
point. The wry remark that "A Region is an area safely larger than the
last one to whose problems we found no solution" is not a wry remark in
these terms. It is a simple statement of a basic fact about disorganized
complexity; it is much like saying that a large insurance company is
better equipped to average out risks than a small insurance company.

However, while city planning has thus mired itself in deep
misunderstandings about the very nature of the problem with which it is
dealing, the life sciences, unburdened with this mistake, and moving
ahead very rapidly, have been providing some of the concepts that city
planning needs: along with providing the basic strategy of recognizing
problems of organized complexity, they have provided hints about
analyzing and handling this *kind* of problem. These advances have, of
course, filtered from the life sciences into general knowledge; they
have become part of the intellectual fund of our times. And so a growing
number of people have begun, gradually, to think of cities as problems
in organized complexity---organisms that are replete with unexamined,
but obviously []{#calibre_link-2621 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="439"}intricately interconnected, and surely understandable,
relationships. This book is one manifestation of that idea.

This is a point of view which has little currency yet among planners
themselves, among architectural city designers, or among the businessmen
and legislators who learn their planning lessons, naturally, from what
is established and long accepted by planning "experts." Nor is this a
point of view that has much appreciable currency in schools of planning
(perhaps there least of all).

City planning, as a field, has stagnated. It bustles but it does not
advance. Today's plans show little if any perceptible progress in
comparison with plans devised a generation ago. In transportation,
either regional or local, nothing is offered which was not already
offered and popularized in 1938 in the General Motors diorama at the New
York World's Fair, and before that by Le Corbusier. In some respects,
there is outright retrogression. None of today's pallid imitations of
Rockefeller Center is as good as the original, which was built a quarter
of a century ago. Even in conventional planning's *own given terms*,
today's housing projects are no improvement, and usually a
retrogression, in comparison with those of the 1930's.

As long as city planners, and the businessmen, lenders, and legislators
who have learned from planners, cling to the unexamined assumptions that
they are dealing with a problem in the physical sciences, city planning
cannot possibly progress. Of course it stagnates. It lacks the first
requisite for a body of practical and progressing thought: recognition
of the kind of problem at issue. Lacking this, it has found the shortest
distance to a dead end.

Because the life sciences and cities happen to pose the same *kinds* of
problems does not mean they are the *same* problems. The organizations
of living protoplasm and the organizations of living people and
enterprises cannot go under the same microscopes.

However, the tactics for understanding both are similar in the sense
that both depend on the microscopic or detailed view, so to speak,
rather than on the less detailed, naked-eye view suitable for viewing
problems of simplicity or the remote telescopic view suitable for
viewing problems of disorganized complexity.

In the life sciences, organized complexity is handled by identifying
[]{#calibre_link-2629 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="440"}a specific
factor or quantity---say an enzyme---and then painstakingly learning its
intricate relationships and interconnections with other factors or
quantities. All this is observed in terms of the behavior (not mere
presence) of other specific (not generalized) factors or quantities. To
be sure, the techniques of two-variable and disorganized-complexity
analysis are used too, but only as subsidiary
tactics.[\*^2^](#calibre_link-174){#calibre_link-176 .calibre7}

In principle, these are much the same tactics as those that have to be
used to understand and to help cities. In the case of understanding
cities, I think the most important habits of thought are these:

1\. To think about processes;

2\. To work inductively, reasoning from particulars to the general,
rather than the reverse;

3\. To seek for "unaverage" clues involving very small quantities, which
reveal the way larger and more "average" quantities are operating.

If you have gotten this far in this book, you do not need much
explanation of these tactics. However, I shall sum them up, to bring out
points otherwise left only as implications.

Why think about processes? Objects in cities---whether they are
buildings, streets, parks, districts, landmarks, or anything else---can
have radically differing effects, depending upon the circumstances and
contexts in which they exist. Thus, for instance, almost nothing useful
can be understood or can be done about improving city dwellings if these
are considered in the abstract as "housing." City dwellings---either
existing or potential---are *specific* and particularized buildings
*always involved in differing, specific processes* such as unslumming,
slumming, generation of diversity, self-destruction of diversity.

This book has discussed cities, and their components almost entirely in
the form of processes, because the subject matter dictates this. For
cities, processes are of the essence. Furthermore, []{#calibre_link-2637
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="441"}once one thinks about city
processes, it follows that one *must* think of catalysts of these
processes, and this too is of the essence.

The processes that occur in cities are not arcane, capable of being
understood only by experts. They can be understood by almost anybody.
Many ordinary people already understand them; they simply have not given
these processes names, or considered that by understanding these
ordinary arrangements of cause and effect, we can also direct them if we
want to.

Why reason inductively? Because to reason, instead, from generalizations
ultimately drives us into absurdities---as in the case of the Boston
planner who knew (against all the real-life evidence he had) that the
North End had to be a slum because the generalizations that make him an
expert say it is.

This is an obvious pitfall because the generalizations on which the
planner was depending are themselves so nonsensical. However, inductive
reasoning is just as important for identifying, understanding and
constructively using the forces and processes that actually are relevant
to cities, and therefore are not nonsensical. I have generalized about
these forces and processes considerably, but let no one be misled into
believing that these generalizations can be used routinely to declare
what the particulars, in this or that place, *ought* to mean. City
processes in real life are too complex to be routine, too particularized
for application as abstractions. They are always made up of interactions
among unique combinations of particulars, and there is no substitute for
knowing the particulars.

Inductive reasoning of this kind is, again, something that can be
engaged in by ordinary, interested citizens, and again they have the
advantage over planners. Planners have been trained and disciplined in
*deductive* thinking, like the Boston planner who learned his lessons
only too well. Possibly because of this bad training, planners
frequently seem to be less well equipped intellectually for respecting
and understanding particulars than ordinary people, untrained in
expertise, who are attached to a neighborhood, accustomed to using it,
and so are not accustomed to thinking of it in generalized or abstract
fashion.

Why seek "unaverage" clues, involving small quantities? Comprehensive
[]{#calibre_link-2643 .calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="442"}statistical
studies, to be sure, can *sometimes* be useful abstracted measurements
of the sizes, ranges, averages and medians of this and that. Gathered
from time to time, statistics can tell too what has been happening to
these figures. However, they tell almost nothing about how the
quantities are working in systems of organized complexity.

To learn how things are working, we need pinpoint clues. For instance,
all the statistical studies possible about the downtown of Brooklyn,
N.Y., cannot tell us as much about the problem of that downtown and its
cause as is told in five short lines of type in a single newspaper
advertisement. This advertisement, which is for Marboro, a chain of
bookstores, gives the business hours of the chain's five stores. Three
of them (one near Carnegie Hall in Manhattan, one near the Public
Library and not far from Times Square, one in Greenwich Village) stay
open until midnight. A fourth, close to Fifth Avenue and Fifty-ninth
Street, stays open until 10 [P]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}. The fifth, in
downtown Brooklyn, stays open until 8 [P]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}. Here
is a management which keeps its stores open late, if there is business
to be had. The advertisement tells us that Brooklyn's downtown is too
dead by 8 [P]{.x-small}.[M]{.x-small}., as indeed it is. No surveys (and
certainly no mindless, mechanical predictions projected forward in time
from statistical surveys, a boondoggle that today frequently passes for
"planning") can tell us anything so relevant to the composition and to
the need of Brooklyn's downtown as this small, but specific and
precisely accurate, clue to the *workings* of that downtown.

It takes large quantities of the "average" to produce the "unaverage" in
cities. But as was pointed out in [Chapter
Seven](#calibre_link-17){.calibre7}, in the discussion on the generators
of diversity, the mere presence of large quantities---whether people,
uses, structures, jobs, parks, streets or anything else---does not
guarantee much generation of city diversity. These quantities can be
working as factors in inert, low-energy systems, merely maintaining
themselves, if that. Or they can make up interacting, high-energy
systems, producing by-products of the "unaverage."

The "unaverage" can be physical, as in the case of eye-catchers which
are small elements in much larger, more "average" visual scenes. They
can be economic, as in the case of one-of-a-kind []{#calibre_link-2647
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="443"}stores, or cultural, as in the
case of an unusual school or out-of the-ordinary theater. They can be
social, as in the case of public characters, loitering places, or
residents or users who are financially, vocationally, racially or
culturally unaverage.

Quantities of the "unaverage," which are bound to be relatively small,
are indispensable to vital cities. However, in the sense that I am
speaking of them here, "unaverage" quantities are also important as
analytical means---as clues. They are often the only announcers of the
way various large quantities are behaving, or failing to behave, in
combination with each other. As a rough analogy, we may think of
quantitatively minute vitamins in protoplasmic systems, or trace
elements in pasture plants. These things are necessary for proper
functioning of the systems of which they are a part; however, their
usefulness does not end there, because they can and do also serve as
vital clues to *what* is happening in the systems of which they are a
part.

This awareness of "unaverage" clues---or awareness of their lack---is,
again, something any citizen can practice. City dwellers, indeed, are
commonly great informal experts in precisely this subject. Ordinary
people in cities have an awareness of "unaverage" quantities which is
quite consonant with the importance of these relatively small
quantities. And again, planners are the ones at the disadvantage. They
have inevitably come to regard "unaverage" quantities as relatively
inconsequential, because these are *statistically* inconsequential. They
have been trained to discount what is most vital.

Now we must dig a little deeper into the bog of intellectual
misconceptions about cities in which orthodox reformers and planners
have mired themselves (and the rest of us). Underlying the city
planners' deep disrespect for their subject matter, underlying the
jejune belief in the "dark and foreboding" irrationality or chaos of
cities, lies a long-established misconception about the relationship of
cities---and indeed of men---with the rest of nature.

Human beings are, of course, a part of nature, as much so as grizzly
bears or bees or whales or sorghum cane. The cities of human beings are
as natural, being a product of one form of nature, []{#calibre_link-2653
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="444"}as are the colonies of prairie
dogs or the beds of oysters. The botanist Edgar Anderson has written
wittily and sensitively in *Landscape* magazine from time to time about
cities as a form of nature. "Over much of the world," he comments, "man
has been accepted as a city-loving creature." Nature watching, he points
out, "is quite as easy in the city as in the country; all one has to do
is accept Man as a part of Nature. Remember that as a specimen of *Homo
sapiens* you are far and away most likely to find that species an
effective guide to deeper understanding of natural history."

A curious but understandable thing happened in the eighteenth century.
By then, the cities of Europeans had done well enough by them, mediating
between them and many harsh aspects of nature, so that something became
popularly possible which previously had been a
rarity---sentimentalization of nature, or at any rate,
sentimentalization of a rustic or a barbarian relationship with nature.
Marie Antoinette playing milkmaid was an expression of this
sentimentality on one plane. The romantic idea of the "noble savage" was
an even sillier one, on another plane. So, in this country, was
Jefferson's intellectual rejection of cities of free artisans and
mechanics, and his dream of an ideal republic of self-reliant rural
yeomen---a pathetic dream for a good and great man whose land was tilled
by slaves.

In real life, barbarians (and peasants) are the least free of
men---bound by tradition, ridden by caste, fettered by superstitions,
riddled by suspicion and foreboding of whatever is strange. "City air
makes free," was the medieval saying, when city air literally did make
free the runaway serf. City air still makes free the runaways from
company towns, from plantations, from factory-farms, from subsistence
farms, from migrant picker routes, from mining villages, from one-class
suburbs.

Owing to the mediation of cities, it became popularly possible to regard
"nature" as benign, ennobling and pure, and by extension to regard
"natural man" (take your pick of how "natural") as so too. Opposed to
all this fictionalized purity, nobility and beneficence, cities, not
being fictions, could be considered as seats of malignancy
and---obviously---the enemies of nature. And once people begin looking
at nature as if it were a nice big St. Bernard []{#calibre_link-2657
.calibre8 type="pagebreak" title="445"}dog for the children, what could
be more natural than the desire to bring this sentimental pet into the
city too, so the city might get some nobility, purity and beneficence by
association?

There are dangers in sentimentalizing nature. Most sentimental ideas
imply, at bottom, a deep if unacknowledged disrespect. It is no accident
that we Americans, probably the world's champion sentimentalizers about
nature, are at one and the same time probably the world's most voracious
and disrespectful destroyers of wild and rural countryside.

It is neither love for nature nor respect for nature that leads to this
schizophrenic attitude. Instead, it is a sentimental desire to toy,
rather patronizingly, with some insipid, standardized, suburbanized
shadow of nature---apparently in sheer disbelief that we and our cities,
just by virtue of being, are a legitimate part of nature too, and
involved with it in much deeper and more inescapable ways than grass
trimming, sunbathing, and contemplative uplift. And so, each day,
several thousand more acres of our countryside are eaten by the
bulldozers, covered by pavement, dotted with suburbanites who have
killed the thing they thought they came to find. Our irreplaceable
heritage of Grade I agricultural land (a rare treasure of nature on this
earth) is sacrificed for highways or supermarket parking lots as
ruthlessly and unthinkingly as the trees in the woodlands are uprooted,
the streams and rivers polluted and the air itself filled with the
gasoline exhausts (products of eons of nature's manufacturing) required
in this great national effort to cozy up with a fictionalized nature and
flee the "unnaturalness" of the city.

The semisuburbanized and suburbanized messes we create in this way
become despised by their own inhabitants tomorrow. These thin
dispersions lack any reasonable degree of innate vitality, staying
power, or inherent usefulness as settlements. Few of them, and these
only the most expensive as a rule, hold their attraction much longer
than a generation; then they begin to decay in the pattern of city gray
areas. Indeed, an immense amount of today's city gray belts was
yesterday's dispersion closer to "nature." Of the buildings on the
thirty thousand acres of already blighted or already fast-blighting
residential areas in northern New Jersey, for example, half are less
than forty years old. []{#calibre_link-2661 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="446"}Thirty years from now, we shall have accumulated new
problems of blight and decay over acreages so immense that in comparison
the present problems of the great cities' gray belts will look piddling.
Nor, however destructive, is this something which happens accidentally
or without the use of will. This is exactly what we, as a society, have
willed to happen.

Nature, sentimentalized and considered as the antithesis of cities, is
apparently assumed to consist of grass, fresh air and little else, and
this ludicrous disrespect results in the devastation of nature even
formally and publicly preserved in the form of a pet.

For example, up the Hudson River, north of New York City, is a state
park at Croton Point, a place for picnicking, ballplaying and looking at
the lordly (polluted) Hudson. At the Point itself is---or was---a
geological curiosity: a stretch of beach about fifteen yards long where
the blue-gray clay, glacially deposited there, and the action of the
river currents and the sun combined to manufacture clay dogs. These are
natural sculptures, compacted almost to the density of stone, and baked,
and they are of a most curious variety, from breathtakingly subtle and
simple curving forms to fantastic concoctions of more than Oriental
splendor. There are only a few places in the entire world where clay
dogs may be found.

Generations of New York City geology students, along with picnickers,
tired ballplayers and delighted children, treasure hunted among the clay
dogs and carried their favorites home. And always, the clay, the river
and the sun made more, and more, and more, inexhaustibly, no two alike.

Occasionally through the years, having been introduced to the clay dogs
long ago by a geology teacher, I would go back to treasure hunt among
them. A few summers ago, my husband and I took our children to the Point
so they might find some and also so they might see how they are made.

But we were a season behind improvers on nature. The slope of muddy clay
that formed the little stretch of unique beach had been demolished. In
its place was a rustic retaining wall and an extension of the park's
lawns. (The park had been augmented---statistically.) Digging beneath
the new lawn here and there---for we can desecrate the next man's
desecrations as well as anyone---we []{#calibre_link-2667 .calibre8
type="pagebreak" title="447"}found broken bits of clay dogs, mashed by
the bulldozers, the last evidence of a natural process that may well
have been halted here forever.

Who would prefer this vapid suburbanization to timeless wonders? What
kind of park supervisor would permit such vandalism of nature? An all
too familiar kind of mind is obviously at work here: a mind seeing only
disorder where a most intricate and unique order exists; the same kind
of mind that sees only disorder in the life of city streets, and itches
to erase it, standardize it, sub-urbanize it.

The two responses are connected: Cities, as created or used by
city-loving creatures are unrespected by such simple minds because they
are not bland shadows of cities suburbanized. Other aspects of nature
are equally unrespected because they are not bland shadows of nature
suburbanized. Sentimentality about nature denatures everything it
touches.

Big cities and countrysides can get along well together. Big cities need
real countryside close by. And countryside---from man's point of
view---needs big cities, with all their diverse opportunities and
productivity, so human beings can be in a position to appreciate the
rest of the natural world instead of to curse it.

Being human is itself difficult, and therefore all kinds of settlements
(except dream cities) have problems. Big cities have difficulties in
abundance, because they have people in abundance. But vital cities are
not helpless to combat even the most difficult of problems. They are not
passive victims of chains of circumstances, any more than they are the
malignant opposite of nature.

Vital cities have marvelous innate abilities for understanding,
communicating, contriving and inventing what is required to combat their
difficulties. Perhaps the most striking example of this ability is the
effect that big cities have had on disease. Cities were once the most
helpless and devastated victims of disease, but they became great
disease conquerors. All the apparatus of surgery, hygiene, microbiology,
chemistry, telecommunications, public health measures, teaching and
research hospitals, ambulances and the like, which people not only in
cities but also outside them depend upon for the unending war against
premature []{#calibre_link-2673 .calibre8 type="pagebreak"
title="448"}mortality, are fundamentally products of big cities and
would be inconceivable without big cities. The surplus wealth, the
productivity, the close-grained juxtaposition of talents that permit
society to support advances such as these are themselves products of our
organization into cities, and especially into big and dense cities.

It may be romantic to search for the salves of society's ills in
slow-moving rustic surroundings, or among innocent, unspoiled
provincials, if such exist, but it is a waste of time. Does anyone
suppose that, in real life, answers to any of the great questions that
worry us today are going to come out of homogeneous settlements?

Dull, inert cities, it is true, do contain the seeds of their own
destruction and little else. But lively, diverse, intense cities contain
the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over
for problems and needs outside themselves.
