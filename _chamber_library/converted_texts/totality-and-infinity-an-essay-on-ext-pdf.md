INTRODUCTION

Ever since the beginning of the modern phenomenological movement
disciplined attention has been paid to various patterns of human experi-
ence as they are actually lived through in the concrete. This has brought
forth many attempts to find a general philosophical position which can
do justice to these experiences without reduction or distortion. In
France, the best known of these recent attempts have been made by Sartre
in his Being and Nothingness and by Merleau-Ponty in his Phenomenol-
ogy of Perception and certain later fragments. Sartre has a keen sense
for life as it is lived, and his work is marked by many penetrating descrip-
tions. But his dualistic ontology of the en-soi versus the pour-soi has
seemed over-simple and inadequate to many critics, and has been seriously
qualified by the author himself in his latest Marxist work, The Critique
of Dialetical Reason. Merleau-Ponty's major work is a lasting contri-
bution to the phenomenology of the pre-objective world of perception.
But aside from a few brief hints and sketches, he was unable, before his
unfortunate death in 1961, to work out carefully his ultimate philosophi-
cal point of view.
This leaves us then with the German philosopher, Heidegger, as the
only contemporary thinker who has formulated a total ontology which
claims to do justice to the stable results of phenomenology and to the liv-
ing existential thought of our time. There is no doubt that Heidegger's
early work, Sein und Zeit, is a highly original contribution to philoso-
phy. But as critics have pointed out, it is marked by certain special fea-
tures and one-sided emphases which are open to serious question. The
author himself has apparently recognized the exaggerated anthropocen-
trism or subjectivism of its point of view which he has tried to correct by
an opposite emphasis on a quasi-independent Being in his later and more
obscure writings. Another fact needs to be noted. Since the publication
of Sein und Zeit in 1927 there has been a great outpouring of German
works attacking or defending certain special theses of Heidegger in dif-
ferent fields. But he does not seem to have stirred up original thinking
along new lines in his native country.
The present book Totality and Infinity, of Emmanuel Levinas, shows,
11
12                         Totality and Infinity
however, that this is definitely not true in France. The author is thor-
oughly familiar with recent phenomenology and existential philosophy,
and has an exhaustive knowledge of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, and
Merleau-Ponty. Without these new developments, his work would have
been impossible. It contains many penetrating descriptions of patterns of
experience as we live them through, and many far-ranging reflections on
these. It is basically phenomenological in character. But it is far more
~han a mere elaboration or correction of past insights. It is not often that
one finds a philosophical work that is both radically original and care-
fully thought through. This book is both. It is striking out along new
lines to formulate a general position which is opposed to Husserl's tran-
scendental idealism as well as to Heidegger's hermeneutic philosophy of
Being. In this way it shows the inexhaustible richness of our lived expe-
rience and the fruitfulness of reflecting on its forms and patterns. The
radical empiricists who, since the time of William James, have doubted
that the methods of transcendental idealism fit the patterns of experience,
will find much supporting evidence in this work, which is full of novel
insights and argument.
According to Levinas, I find myself existing in a world of alien
things and elements which are other than, but not negations of myself.
The latter is a logical relation which brings its terms together into a
neutral system in the light of which each can be understood impartially,
as we say. But the world as I originally experience it is not a logical
system of this kind, in which no term takes precedence over the rest. My
primary experience is definitely biased and egocentric. I take precedence
over the various objects I find around me, and in so far as my experience
is normal, I learn to manipulate and control them to my advantage,
either as the member of a group which I identify with myself or simply
as myself alone. In general, these objects are at my disposal, and I am
free to play with them, live on them, and to enjoy them at my pleasure.
Levinas finds that this primordial experience of enjoyment (jouis-
sance) has been neglected by Heidegger and other phenomenologists,
and he devotes many pages to describing it in its major manifestations.
There is a strong tendency in all human individuals and groups to main-
tain this egocentric attitude and to think of other individuals either
as extensions of the self, or as alien objects to be manipulated for the
advantage of the individual or social self. According to Levinas, neither
of these egocentric views does justice to our original experience of the
other person, and the most fundamental part of the book is devoted to
Introduction                             13
the description and analysis of this experience-the phenomenology of
the other, as we may call it.
The other person as he comes before me in a face to face encounter
is not an alter ego, another self with different properties and accidents
but in all essential respects like me. This may be the expression of an
optimistic hope from a self-centered point of view which is often veri-
fied. The other may, indeed, turn out to be, on the surface at least,
merely an analogue of myself. But not necessarily! I may find him to
be inhabiting a world that is basically other than mine and to be essen-
tially different from me. He is not a mere object to be subsumed under
one of my categories and given a place in my world. Most of us are now
familiar with this other-reducing theory which Sartre propounds in his
Being and Nothingness. It may describe a widespread manner of deal-
ing with the other person but it fails to do justice to his own existence,
as is clearly indicated by the slavery and rebellion to which it leads.
Nor finally do we take account of these inner depths of alien existence
by regarding the other along Hegelian lines as a mere negation of the
self. This only encompasses him in a supposedly neutral system that is
readily identified with the rational self. Can it be that the underlying,
unifying one of our monistic systems has been the avaricious, power-
seeking, organizing, self-same self?
In any case, whether or not they are truly rational, these traditional
theories are one-sidedly egocentric and reductive. None of them does
justice to the other as I meet him for the first time in his strangeness
face to face. I see this countenance before me nude and bare. He is
present in the flesh. But as Levinas points out in his revealing descrip-
tions, there is also a sense of distance and even of absence in his ques-
tioning glance. He is far from me and other than myself, a stranger,
and I cannot be sure of what this strangeness may conceal. Hence the
need to show friendly intent which brought forth the earliest forms of
introduction and greeting. For example, the closed fist might conceal a
knife, and coming "open handed" means no enmity, as Ortega y Gasset
has shown in his reflections on the handshake in his Man and People.
But this is only a bare beginning. Even if he comes with no ill will, he
remains a stranger inhabiting an alien world of his own. Of course, I
may simply treat him as a different version of myself, or, if I have the
power, place him under my categories and use him for my purposes. But
this means reducing him to what he is not. How can I coexist with him
and still leave his otherness intact?
14                        Totality and Infinity
According to Levinas, there is only one way, by language, and some
of the more provocative sections of the book are devoted to this topic.
The questioning glance of the other is seeking for a meaningful response.
Of course, I may give only a casual word, and go on my own way with
indifference, passing the other by. But if communication and community
is to be achieved, a real response, a responsible answer must be given.
This means that I must be ready to put my world into words, and to
offer it to the other. There can be no free interchange without some-
thing to give. Responsible communication depends on an initial act of
generosity, a giving of my world to him with all its dubious assumptions
and arbitrary features. They are then exposed to the questions of the
other, and an escape from egotism becomes possible.
It has been and is still widely held that this can be achieved only by
a joint sacrifice of self to a neutral, englobing system. But Levinas
brings forth very strong evidence to show that this is not the case. By
speaking to the other I enter into a relation with him. But this speaking
does not bind me down or limit me, because I remain at a distance from
what is said. Hence real conversation with an other cannot be exhaus-
tively planned. I am never sure just what he will say, and there is al-
ways room for reinterpretation and spontaneity on both sides. My
autonomy remains intact. In fact, in so far as I have any, it is stimu-
lated to further intensity by searching questions from a point of view
that is not merely opposite and therefore correlative to mine, but gen-
uinely other. I can always say what I wish, and even begin once again
de novo. The same is true of the other. He does not merely present me
with lifeless signs into which I am free to read meanings of my own.
His expressions bear his meanings, and he is himself present to bring them
out and defend them. There is no difference between the active expres-
sion and what is expressed. The two coincide. The other is not an ob-
ject that must be interpreted and illumined by my alien light. He
shines forth with his own light, and speaks for himself.
Levinas, of course, is not denying that a great part of our speaking
and thinking is systematic and bound by logic of some kind. What he
is interested in showing is that prior to these systems, which are required
to meet many needs, and presupposed by them is the existing individual
and his ethical choice to welcome the stranger and to share his world by
speaking to him. In other words, we do not become social by first being
systematic. We become systematic and orderly in our thinking by first
freely making a choice for generosity and communication, i.e., for the
Introduction                             15
social. What we call thinking and speaking is very often only a playing
with our own words and concepts or a succession of egocentric mono-
logues. But according to Levinas, speaking becomes serious only when
we pay attention to the other and take account of him and the strange
world he inhabits. It is only by responding to him that I become aware
of the arbitrary views and attitudes into which my uncriticized freedom
always leads me, and become responsible, that is, able to respond. It is
only then that I see the need of justifying my egocentric attitudes, and
of doing justice to the other in my thought and in my action.
Hegel and his followers have also seen the accidental biases and ec-
centricities that make the personal freedom of the individual unreliable
and open to criticism. They have therefore attacked the personal exist-
ence, which Levinas calls "the inner life," as capricious and subjective,
and have defended those objective rational systems and social organiza-
tions which subordinate, or even repress, the individual. Levinas grants
that they have dominated the course of human history. He points out,
however, that while this view may have weakened the influence of indi-
vidual fantasies and delusions, it has led to forms of social suppression
and tyranny which are even worse. Must we always choose one or the
other of these evils? Anarchy on the one hand and tyranny on the
other?
In politics, in education, in every phase of our cultural life, are we
not constantly presented with alternatives of this kind? One may say
that a main argument of this book is the working out of a third way be-
tween the horns of this recurrent dilemma. Totalitarian thinking accepts
vision rather than language as its model. It aims to gain an all-inclusive,
panoramic view of all things, including the other, in a neutral, impersonal
light like the Hegelian Geist (Spirit), or the Heideggerian Being. It
sees the dangers of an uncontrolled, individual freedom, and puts itself
forth as the only rational answer to anarchy. To be free is the same as
to be rational, and to be rational is to give oneself over to the total
system that is developing in world history. Since the essential self is
also rational, the development of this system will coincide with the
interests of the self. All otherness will be absorbed in this total system
of harmony and order.
According to Levinas, however, there is another way, not yet fully
explored, which he is suggesting in this book. It cannot be identified
with subjective anarchism since it takes account of the other and his
criticism. But it also differs from the holistic thinking of traditional
16                        Totality and Infinity
philosophy in the following ways. Instead of referring to the panoramic
sense of vision as its model for understanding, it refers to language
where there is always room for the diversity of dialogue, and for further
growth through the dynamics of question and answer. This other-
regarding way of thought rejects the traditional assumption that reason
has no plural, and asks why we should not recognize what our lived ex-
perience shows us, that reason has many centers, and approaches the
truth in many different ways. Instead of building great systems in
which the singular diversities of things and persons are passed over and
diluted, this way of thinking prefers to start with the careful analysis
of the peculiar features of each being in its otherness, and only then
to clarify its relations with other things in the light of its peculiar and
distinctive features.
This other-oriented mode of speaking and thinking will pay less at-
tention to things as they appear to the separated self, and more attention
to the search for what they are in themselves, in their radical other-
ness, even though this is less certain and always more difficult to find.
This will mean less interest in conceptual constructions and a greater
readiness to listen and learn from experience. It will not think of
knowing, in the sense of gathering, as the primary aim of man from which
action will follow as a matter of course, but rather of action and of
the achievement of justice and peace as prior to speaking and thinking.
The basic difference is between a mode of thought which tries to
gather all things around the mind, or self, of the thinker, and an ex-
ternally oriented mode which attempts to pentrate into what is radically
other than the mind that is thinking it. This difference emerges with
peculiar clarity in the case of my meeting with the other person. I
may either decide to remain within myself, assimilating the other and
trying to make use of him, or I may take the risk of going out of my way
and trying to speak and to give to him. This does not fulfill a need.
I can satisfy my needs more adequately by keeping to myself and the
members of the in-group with which I am identified. And yet it is
the expression of a desire, as Levinas calls it, for that which transcends
me and my self-centered categories. This desire is never satisfied, but
it seems insatiable, and feeds on itself.
By communicating with the other, I enter into a relation with him
which does not necessarily lead to my dependence on him. Nor does he
become dependent on me. He can absolve himself from this relation
with his integrity intact. Hence Levinas calls it absolving, or absolute.

And he finds many other relations of this kind, for example, that of
truth. In so far as I am related to another entity and share in its
being, it must be really changed. But as classical metaphysics pointed
out, in so far as I discover the truth about something, it is absolved
from this relation and remains unchanged. The same is true of the
idea of absolute perfection which is clearly radically other than what I
am. But I can strive for such an other without changing it, or losing my
own integrity, just as I can respond to another person and engage in
dialogue without jeopardizing his or my own being. Levinas suggests
that this may be the reason for Plato's well-known statement at Repub-
lic 509 that the good lies beyond being, and relates it to his own view
that the conclusions of our basic philosophical questions are to be found
beyond metaphysics in ethics. My way of existing conveys my final
answer.
As Levinas points out, one answer is given by the totalizers who
are satisfied with themselves and with the systems they can organize
around themselves as they already are. A very different answer is given
by those who are dissatisfied, and who strive for what is other than
themselves, the infinitizers, as we may call them. The former seek for
power and control; the latter for a higher quality of life. The former
strive for order and system; the latter for freedom and creative ad-
vance. This leads to the basic contrast which is expressed in the title
of the book, between totality on the one hand and infinity on the
other. Many examples of the former can be found in the history of
our Western thought. The latter is largely unknown and untried.
It is this outwardly directed but self-centered totalistic thinking that
organizes men and things into power systems, and gives us control over
nature and other people. Hence it has dominated the course of human
history. From this point of view, only the neutral and impersonal,
Being, for example, is important. "What is it?" is the most basic
question that requires an answer in terms of a context, a system. The
real is something that can be brought before the senses and the mind as
an object. The acts of sensing, thinking, existing, as they are lived
through, are discounted as subjective. A priority is, therefore, placed
on objective thinking, and the objective. The group is more powerfui,
more inclusive, and, therefore, more important than the individual. To
be free is to sacrifice the arbitrary inner self and to fit into a rationally
grounded system. Inner feelings and thoughts cannot be observed.
They are private and unstable. So men are judged by what they do,
18                         Totality and I n/inity
their works that are visible and remain. Since they endure, they can be
judged by the group which also remains. They are what they are judged
to be by the ongoing course of history. Since this is the inclusive system,
with nothing beyond, there is no appeal from this judgment. It is final.
As Hegel said, Die W eltgeschichte ist die W eltgericht. History itself
is the final judge of history.
To the infinitizers on the other hand, this seems like a partial and
biased doctrine. Systematic thinking, no doubt, has its place. It is
required for the establishment of those power structures which satisfy
necessary needs. But when absolutized in this way and applied to free
men, it constitutes violence, which is not merely found in temporary
and accidental displays of armed force, but in the permanent tyranny of
power systems which free men should resist. Slavery is the dominance
of the neutral and impersonal over the active and personal. In a living
dialogue and even in a written monologue of many volumes it is more
important to find out who is speaking and why, than merely to know
what is said. We do not need to know the other person (or thing) as
he is in himself, and we shall never know him apart from acting with
him. But unless we desire this, and go on trying, we shall never escape
from the subjectivism of our systems and the objects that they bring
before us to categorize and manipulate. We do not get rid of our
thoughts and feelings by ignoring them or by any other means. But we
may seek to transcend them, first as individuals and only later, perhaps,
as a group. The individual person becomes free and responsible not by
fitting into a system but rather by fighting against it and by acting on
his own.
Those who are not limited to visible objects and who have some sense
of the inner life t~at is revealed in dialogue will not judge a man ex-
clusively by his works. They will recognize the alien factors that always
intervene between the man himself and the objects he produces. They
will also be aware of the difference between those who judge and the
other whom they are judging. They will understand that the judg-
ment of history is made by survivors on the works of the dead who are
no longer present to explain and defend them. They will see that this
judgment is crude and subjective, varying with the otherness of those
who judge differently from place to place and from time to time. So
they will never accept it as final. They will seek rather to separate
themselves from this course of history to make judgments of their own
with reference to a standard of perfection that is radically other and
Introduction                             19
transcendent. To this "idea of the infinite," as Levinas calls it, an ap-
peal can be made. We are not bound to accept the status quo as right,
and history itself is not the final judge of history.
This is only the bare suggestion of a few major points in the careful
exposition of a pluralistic point of view which is supported by a wealth of
concrete illustration and phenomenological description. This is particu-
larly true of the author's studies of our human meeting and communica-
tion with the other, which underlies the whole work. But it is also true
of his studies of suffering and patience, of the lived human body which
is neither a thing nor a purely subjective principle as Merleau-Ponty
sometimes seems to think, and of the condition of violence as a systemic
condition to which man is always subject, and which should be of special
interest to the contemporary reader. Levinas' description between need
which seeks to fill a negation or lack in the subject, and desire which is
positively attracted by something other not yet possessed or needed,
is worked out in very original ways and grounded on a rich array of
phenomenological evidence. The same is true of his suggestive inter-
pretations of time, the parental relation, and the family which is not a
mere step on the way to the state, as Hegel supposed.
The careful reader may find certain deficiencies in the argument. He
may wonder why the original state of enjoyment is called purely subjec-
tive and even solipsistic when this separated self is clearly encompassed
by the elements, and existing, in some sense not fully clear, with others
in the world. He may seek for more light on what the author calls the
"inner life" and on its specific differences from the preceding subjective
condition. He may find himself doubting whether his experience of the
other person is a sufficient ground for "the idea of the infinite" as the
author seems to suppose. Furthermore, he may wonder about the strange
asymmetry, the complete supremacy of the other, that the author finds in
the self-other relation. He may be finally puzzled about some of the
things Levinas seems to read into the parent-child relation. Other diffi-
culties may arise for the critical reader.
But whatever his point of view may be, he will not be the same after
reading this work with any care. It is the disciplined development of a
pluralistic point of view that has not been thought through before. It
takes account of a wide array of empirical patterns that are carefully
and accurately described and analyzed. The book shows the lasting
fertility of the phenomenological movement in the broad sense of this
phrase with which we are now becoming familiar. But it is not merely
20                        Totality and Infinity
a reinterpretation of what has been said before. It is something highly
original and, to use its own language, radically other. For example,
though it comes, as we have indicated, from a phenomenological back-
ground, and without Husserl and Heidegger could not have been written,
it is highly critical of Husserl and constitutes one of the most basic
attacks on the thought of Heidegger that has yet been formulated.
Alphonso Lingis is thoroughly familiar with recent French philosophy
and with the background of this work. The original French of the
author is not written in a popular style. But Lingis has given us a trans-
lation which is accurate and discerning. The work deserves to be widely
read not only by professional philosophers, for it is carefully thought
out by an original mind, but by intelligent laymen as well, for it is close
to life.

PREFACE
Everyone will readily agree that it is of the highest importance to
know whether we are not duped by morality.
Does not lucidity, the mind's openness upon the true, consist in
catching sight of the permanent possibility of war? The state of war
suspends morality; it divests the eternal institutions and obligations of
their eternity and rescinds ad interim the unconditional imperatives.
In advance its shadow falls over the actions of men. War is not only one
of the ordeals-the greatest-of which morality lives; it renders morality
derisory. The art of foreseeing war and of winning it by every means-
politics-is henceforth en joined as the very exercise of reason. Politics is
opposed to morality, as philosophy to naivete.
We do not need obscure fragments of Heraclitus to prove that being
reveals itself as war to philosophical thought, that war does not only
affect it as the most patent fact, but as the very patency, or the truth, of
the real. In war reality rends the words and images that dissimulate it,
to obtrude in its nudity and in its harshness. Harsh reality ( this sounds
like a pleonasm I), harsh object-lesson, at the very moment of its fulgura-
tion when the drapings of illusion burn war is produced as the pure
experience of pure being. The ontological event that takes form in this
black light is a casting into movement of beings hitherto anchored in
their identity, a mobilization of absolutes, by an objective order from
which there is no escape. The trial by force is the test of the real. But
violence does not consist so much in injuring and annihilating persons as
in interrupting their continuity, making them play roles in which they no
longer recognize themselves, making them betray not only commitments
but their own substance, making them carry out actions that will destroy
every possibility for action. Not only modern war but every war em-
ploys arms that turn against those who wield them. It establishes an or-
der from which no one can keep his distance; nothing henceforth is ex-
terior. War does not manifest exteriority and the other as other; it
destroys the identity of the same.
The visage of being that shows itself in war is fixed in the concept of
totality, which dominates Western philosophy. Individuals are reduced
to being bearers of forces that command them unbeknown to themselves.
21
22                         Totality and Infinity
The meaning of individuals ( invisible outside of this totality) is derived
from the totality. The unicity of each present is incessantly sacrificed to a
future appealed to to bring forth its objective meaning. For the ultimate
meaning alone counts; the last act alone changes beings into themselves.
They are what they will appear to be in the already plastic forms of the
epic.
The moral consciousness can sustain the mocking gaze of the political
man only if the certitude of peace dominates the evidence of war. Such a
certitude is not obtained by a simple play of antitheses. The peace of
empires issued from war rests on war. It does not restore to the alienated
beings their lost identity. For that a primordial and original relation
with being is needed.
Morality will oppose politics in history and will have gone beyond the
functions of prudence or the canons of the beautiful to proclaim itself
unconditional and universal when the eschatology of messianic peace
will have come to superpose itself upon the ontology of war. Philoso-
phers distrust it. To be sure they profit from it to announce peace also;
they deduce a final peace from the reason that plays out its stakes
in ancient and present-day wars: they found morality on politics.
But for them eschatology-a subjective and arbitrary divination of the
future, the result of a revelation without evidences, tributary of faith-
belongs naturally to Opinion.
However, the extraordinary phenomenon of prophetic eschatology cer-
tainly does not intend to win its civic rights within the domain of
thought by being assimilated to a philosophical evidence. In religions
and even in theologies eschatology, like an oracle, does indeed seem to
"complete" philosophical evidences; its beliefs-conjectures mean to be
more certain than the evidences-as though eschatology added informa-
tion about the future by revealing the finality of being. But, when
reduced to the evidences, eschatology would then already accept the
ontology of totality issued from war. Its real import lies elsewhere. It
does not introduce a teleological system into the totality; it does not
consist in teaching the orientation of history. Eschatology institutes a
relation with being beyond the totality or beyond history, and not with
being beyond the past and the present. Not with the void that would
surround the totality and where one could, arbitrarily, think what one
likes, and thus promote the claims of a subjectivity free as the wind. It
is a relationship with a surplus always exterior to the totality, as though
the objective totality did not fill out the true measure of being, as
Preface                                  23
though another concept, the concept of infinity, were needed to express
this transcendence with regard to totality, non-encompassable within a
totality and as primordial as totality.
This "beyond" the totality and objective experience is, however, not to
be described in a purely negative fashion. It is reflected within the
totality and history, within experience. The eschatological, as the "be-
yond" of history, draws beings out of the jurisdiction of history and the
future; it arouses them in and calls them forth to their full responsibility.
Submitting history as a whole to judgment, exterior to the very wars that
mark its end, it restores to each instant its full signification in that very
instant: all the causes are ready to be heard. It is not the last judgment
that is decisive, but the judgment of all the instants in time, when the
living are judged. The eschatological notion of judgment ( contrary to
the judgment of history in which Hegel wrongly saw its rationalization)
implies that beings have an identity "before" eternity, before the accom-
plishment of history, before the fullness of time, while there is still time;
implies that beings exist in relationship, to be sure, but on the basis of
themselves and not on the basis of the totality. The idea of being over-
flowing history makes possible existents [etants] both involved in being
and personal, called upon to answer at their trial and consequently al-
ready adult-but, for that very reason, existents that can speak rather
than lending their lips to an anonymous utterance of history. Peace is
produced as this aptitude for speech. The eschatological vision breaks
with the totality of wars and empires in which one does not speak. It
does not envisage the end of history within being understood as a totality,
but institutes a relation with the infinity of being which exceeds the
totality. The first "vision" of eschatology (hereby distinguished from
the revealed opinions of positive religions) reveals the very possibility of.
eschatology, that is, the breach of the totality, the possibility of a
signification without a context. The experience of morality does not
proceed from this vision-it consummates this vision; ethics is an optics.
But it is a "vision" without image, bereft of the synoptic and totalizing
objectifying virtues of vision, a relation or an intentionality of a wholly
different type--which this work seeks to describe.
• We are translating "ltant" throughout by "existent," reserving "being'' to
translate "etre." It will become clear that the distinction between "etre" and
"etant" in this work alludes to but does not reproduce the Heideggerian distinc-
tion between "Sein" and "Seiendes."
We shall distinguish between "etant" and the less employed term "existant"
by using the form "existant" to translate the latter term.-Trans.
24                         Totality and Infinity
Is relationship with Being produced only in representation, the natural
locus of evidence? Does objectivity, whose harshness and universal
power is revealed in war, provide the unique and primordial form in
which Being, when it is distinguished from image, dream, and subjec-
tive abstraction, imposes itself on consciousness? Is the apprehension
of an object equivalent to the very movement in which the bonds with
truth are woven? These questions the present work answers in the
negative. Of peace there can be only an eschatology. But this does not
mean that when affirmed objectively it is believed by faith instead of
being known by knowledge. It means, first of all, that peace does not
take place in the objective history disclosed by war, as the end of that war
or as the end of history.
But does not the experience of war refute eschatology, as it refutes
morality? Have we not begun by acknowledging the irrefutable evi-
dence of totality ?
To tell the truth, ever since eschatology has opposed peace to war the
evidence orwar has been maintained in an essentially hypocritical civili-
zation, that is, attached both to the True and to the Good, henceforth
antagomst1c. It is perhaps time to see in hypocrisy not only a base
contingent defect of man, but the underlying rending of a world attached
to both the philosophers and the prophets.
But does not the experience of war and totality coincide, for the
philosopher, with experience and evidence as such? And is not philoso-
phy itself after all defined as an endeavor to live a life beginning in
evidence, opposing the opinion of one's fellow-men, the illusions and
caprice of one's own subjectivity? Does not the eschatology of peace,
outside of this evidence, live on subjective opinions and illusions? V nless
philosophical evidence refers from itself to a situation that can no longer
be stated in terms of "totality" . . . Unless the non-knowing with
which the philosophical knowing begins coincides not with pure nothing-
ness but only with a nothingness of objects. . . . Without substituting
eschatology for philosophy, without philosophically "demonstrating" es-
chatological "truths," we can proceed from the experience of totality
back to a situation where totality breaks up, a situation that conditions
the totality itself. Such a situation is the gleam of exteriority or of
transcendence in the face of the Other.* The rigorously developed con-

"autrui" (the personal Other, the you) by "Other," and "autre" by "other." In
Preface                                  25
cept of this transcendence is expressed by the term infinity. This revela-
tion of infinity does not lead to the acceptance of any dogmatic content,
whose philosophical rationality cannot be argued for in the name of the
transcendental truth of the idea of infinity. For the way we are de-
scribing to work back and remain this side of objective certitude re-
sembles what has come to be called the transcendental method (in which
the technical procedures of transcendental idealism need not necessarily
be comprised).
Would the violence which, for a mind, consists in welcoming a being
to which it is inadequate contradict the ideal of autonomy that guides
philosophy-which in evidence is mistress of her own truth? But the
relation with infinity-the idea of the Infinite, as Descartes calls it-
overflows thought in a wholly different sense than does opinion. Opinion
vanishes like the wind when thought touches it---or is revealed to be
already within that thought. What remains ever exterior to thought
is thought in the idea of infinity. It is the condition for every opinion
as also for every objective truth. The idea of infinity is the mind before
it lends itself to the distinction between what it discovers by itself and
what it receives from opinion.
The relation with infinity cannot, to be sure, be stated in terms of
experience, for infinity overflows the thought that thinks it. Its very
infinition is produced precisely in this overflowing. The relation with
infinity will have to be stated in terms other than those of objective
experience; but if experience precisely means a relation with the abso-
lutely other, that is, with what always overflows thought, the relation
with infinity accomplishes experience in the fullest sense of the word.
Finally, the eschatological vision does not oppose to the experience of
totality the protestation of a person in the name of his personal egoism or
even of his salvation. Such a proclamation of morality based on the pure
subjectivism of the I is refuted by war, the totality it reveals, and the
objective necessities. We oppose to the objectivism of war a subjectivity
born from the eschatological vision. The idea of infinity delivers the
subjectivity from the judgment of history to declare it ready for judg~
ment at every moment and, we shall show,1 called to participate in this
judgment, impossible without it. The harsh law of war breaks up not

doing so, we regrettably sacrifice the possibility of reproducing the author's
use of capital or small letters with both these terms in the French text.
The very important term "visage" shall always be translated "face."-Trans.

against an impotent subjectivism cut off from being, but against the
infinite, more objective than objectivity.
Do the particular beings yield their truth in a Whole in which their
exteriority vanishes? Or, on the contrary, is the ultimate event of being
enacted in the outburst of this exteriority? Our initial question now
assumes this form.
This book then does present itself as a defense of subjectivity, but it
will apprehend the subjectivity not at the level of its purely egoist
protestation against totality, nor in its anguish before death, but as
founded in the idea of infinity.
It will proceed to distinguish between the idea of totality and the idea
of infinity, and affirm the philosophical primacy of the idea of infinity.
It will recount how infinity is produced in the relationship of the same
with the other,• and how the particular and the personal, which are
unsurpassable, as it were magnetize the very field in which the production
of infinity is enacted. The term "production" designates both the
effectuation of being ( the event "is produced," an automobile "is
produced") and its being brought to light or its exposition (an argu-
ment "is produced," an actor "is produced").•• The ambiguity of
this verb conveys the essential ambiguity of the operation by which the
being of an entity simultaneously is brought about [s'evertue] and is
revealed.
The idea of infinity is not an incidental notion forged by a subjectivity
to reflect the case of an entity encountering on the outside nothing
that limits it, overflowing every limit, and thereby infinite. The
production of the infinite entity is inseparable from the idea of infinity,
for it is precisely in the disproportion between the idea of infinity and the
infinity of which it is the idea that this exceeding of limits is produced.
The idea of infinity is the mode of being, the in/inition, of infinity. In-
finity does not first exist, and then reveal itself. Its infinition is produced
as revelation, as a positing of its idea in me. It is produced in the im-

probable feat whereby a separated being fixed in its identity, the same,
the I, nonetheless contains in itself what it can neither contain nor
receive solely by virtue of its own identity. Subjectivity realizes these
impossible exigencies-the astonishing feat of containing more than
it is possible to contain. This book will present subjectivity as welcom-
ing the Other, as hospitality; in it the idea of infinity is consum-
mated. Hence intentionality, where thought remains an adequation
with the object, does not define consciousness at its fundamental level.
All knowing qua intentionality already presupposes the idea of infinity,
which is preeminently non-adequation.
To contain more than one's capacity does not mean to embrace or to
encompass the totality of being in thought or, at least, to be able to
account for it after the fact by the inward play of constitutive thought.
To contain more than one's capacity is to shatter at every moment the
framework of a content that is thought, to cross the barriers of imma-
nence--but without this descent into being reducing itself anew to a
concept of descent. Philosophers have sought to express with the concept
of act ( or of the incarnation that makes it possible) this descent into the
real, which the concept of thought interpreted as a pure knowing would
maintain only as a play of lights. The act of thought-thought as an act
-would precede the thought thinking or becoming conscious of an act.
The notion of act involves a violence essentially: the violence of transi-
tivity, lacking in the transcendence of thought. For the transcendence
of thought remains closed in itself despite all its adventures-which
in the last analysis are purely imaginary, or are adventures traversed as by
Ulysses: on the way home. What, in action, breaks forth as essential
violence is the surplus of being over the thought that claims to contain it,
the marvel of the idea of infinity. The incarnation of consciousness is
therefore comprehensible oniy if, over and beyond adequation, the over-
flowing of the idea by its ideatum, that is, the idea of infinity, moves
consciousness. The idea of infinity ( which is not a representation of
infinity) sustains activity itself. Theoretical thought, knowledge, and
critique, to which activity has been opposed, have the same foundation.
The idea of infinity, which is not in its turn a representation of infinity,
is the common source of activity and theory.
Consciousness then does not consist in equaling being with repre-
sentation, in tending to the full light in which this adequation is to be
sought, but rather in overflowing this play of lights-this phenomenology
-and in accomplishing events whose ultimate signification ( contrary
28                          Totality and Infinity
to the Heideggerian conception) does not lie in disclosing. Philosophy
does indeed dis-cover the signification of these events, but they are pro-
duced without discovery (or truth) being their destiny. No prior
disclosure illuminates the production of these essentially noctural events.
The welcoming of the face and the work of justice-which condition the
birth of truth itself-are not interpretable in terms of disclosure. Phe-
nomenology is a method for philosophy, but phenomenology-the com-
prehension effected through a bringing to light-does not constitute
the ultimate event of being itself. The relation between the same and the
other is not always reducible to knowledge of the other by the same,
nor even to the revelation of the other to the same, which is already fun-
damentally different from disclosure. 2
We were impressed by the opposition to the idea of totality in Franz
Rosenzweig's Stern der Erlosung, a work too often present in this book
to be cited. But the presentation and the development of the notions
employed owe everything to the phenomenological method. Intentional
analysis is the search for the concrete. Notions held under the direct
gaze of the thought that defines them are nevertheless, unbeknown to this
naive thought, revealed to be implanted in horizons unsuspected by this
thought; these horizons endow them with a meaning-such is the essen-
tial teaching of Husserl.3 What does it matter if in the Husserlian
phenomenology taken literally these unsuspected horizons are in their
turn interpreted as thoughts aiming at objects I What counts is the idea
of the overflowing of objectifying thought by a forgotten experience from
which it lives. The break-up of the formal structure of thought ( the
noema of a noesis) into events which this structure dissimulates, but
which sustain it and restore its concrete significance, constitutes a deduc-
tion-necessary and yet non-analytical. In our exposition it is indicated
by expressions such as "that is," or "precisely," or "this accomplishes
that," or "this is produced as that."
The signification that, in the present work, phenomenological deduc-
2 In broaching, at the end of this work, the study of relations which we situate

beyond the face, we come upon events that cannot be described as noeses aim-
ing at noemata, nor as active interventions realizing projects, nor, of course, as
physical forces being discharged into masses. They are conjunctures in being
for which perhaps the term "drama" would be most suitable, in the sense that
Nietzsche would have liked to use it when, at the end of The Case of Wagner,
he regrets that it has always been wrongly translated by action. But it
is because of the resulting equivocation that we forego this term.

tion shows to underlie the theoretical thought concerning being and the
panoramic exposition of being itself is not irrational. The aspiration to
radical exteriority, thus called metaphysical, the respect for this meta-
physical exteriority which, above all, we must "let be," constitutes truth.
It animates this work and evinces its allegiance to the intellectualism of
reason. But theoretical thought, guided by the ideal of objectivity, does
not exhaust this aspiration; it remains this side of its ambitions. If, as
this book will show, ethical relations are to lead transcendence to its
term, this is because the essential of ethics is in its transcendent intention,
and because not every transcendent intention has the noesis-noema struc-
ture. Already of itself ethics is an "optics." It is not limited to
preparing for the theoretical exercise of thought, which would monopo-
lize transcendence. The traditional opposition between theory and prac-
tice will disappear before the metaphysical transcendence by which a
relation with the absolutely other, or truth, is established, and of which
ethics is the royal road. Hitherto the relation between theory and
practice was not conceivable other than as a solidarity or a hierarchy:
activity rests on cognitions that illuminate it; knowledge requires from
acts the mastery of matter, minds, and societies-a technique, a morality,
a politics-that procures the peace necessary for its pure exercise.
We shall go further, and, at the risk of appearing to confuse theory and
practice, deal with both as modes of metaphysical transcendence. The
apparent confusion is deliberate and constitutes one of the theses of
this book. Husserlian phenomenology has made possible this passage
from ethics to metaphysical exteriority.
How far we are in this preface from the theme of the work announced
by its first sentence! Already there is question of so many other things,
even in these preliminary lines, which ought to state without detours the
intent of the work undertaken. Philosophical research in any case does
not answer questions like an interview·, an oracle, or wisdom. And can
one speak of a book as though one had not written it, as though one were
its first critic? Can one thus undo the inevitable dogmatism that gathers
up and gauges an exposition in pursuit of its theme? It will appear in
the eyes of the reader, so naturally indifferent to the vicissitudes of this
chase, as a thicket of difficulties where nothing guarantees the presence of
game. We should like at least to invite him not to be rebuffed by the
aridity of certain pathways, by the labor of the first section, whose
preparatory character is to be emphasized, but in which the horizon of
this whole research takes form.

The word by way of preface which seeks to break through the screen
stretched between the author and the reader by the book itself does not
give itself out as a word of honor. But it belongs to the very essence of
language, which consists in continually undoing its phrase by the fore-
word or the exegesis, in unsaying the said, in attempting to restate
without ceremonies what has already been ill understood in the inevitable
ceremonial in which the said delights.

## The Same And The Other
## A. Metaphysics And
TRANSCENDENCE


1. Desire for the Invisible
"The true life is absent." But we are in the world. Metaphysics
arises and is maintained in this alibi. It is turned toward the "else-
where" and the "otherwise" and the "other." For in the most general
form it has assumed in the history of thought it appears as a movement
going forth from a world that is familiar to us, whatever be the yet
unknown lands that bound it or that it hides from view, from an "at
home" ["chez soi"]* which we inhabit, toward an alien outside-of-
oneself [hors-de-soi], toward a yonder.
The term of this movement, the elsewhere or the other, is called other
in an eminent sense. No journey, no change of climate or of scenery
could satisfy the desire bent toward it. The other metaphysically desired
is not "other" like the bread I eat, the land in which I dwell, the
landscape I contemplate, like, sometimes, myself for myself, this "I.''
that "other." I can "feed" on these realities and to a very great extent
satisfy myself, as though I had simply been lacking them. Their alterity
is thereby reabsorbed into my own identity as a thinker or a possessor.
The metaphysical desire tends toward something else entirely, toward the
absolutely other. The customary analysis of desire can not explain away
its singular pretension. As commonly interpreted need would be at the
basis of desire; desire would characterize a being indigent and incomplete
or fallen from its past grandeur. It would coincide with the conscious-
ness of what has been lost; it would be essentially a nostalgia, a longing
for return. But thus it would not even suspect what the veritably other
IS.
The metaphysical desire does not long to return, for it is desire for a
• "Chez soi"-translating the Hegelian bei sich-will for Levinas express the
original and concrete form in which an existent comes to exist "for itself." We
shall (rather clumsily!) translate "chez soi" by "at home with oneself." But it
should be remembered that it is in the being "at home," i.e. in the act of in-
habiting, that the circuit of the self arises.-Trans.

land not of our birth, for a land foreign to every nature, which has not
been our fatherland and to which we shall never betake ourselves. The
metaphysical desire does not rest upon any prior kinship. It is a desire
that can not be satisfied. For we speak lightly of desires satisfied, or of
sexual needs, or even of moral and religious needs. Love itself is thus
taken to be the satisfaction of a sublime hunger. If this language is
possible it is because most of our desires and love too are not pure. The
desires one can satisfy resemble metaphysical desire only in the decep-
tions of satisfaction or in the exasperation of non-satisfaction and desire
which constitutes voluptuosity itself. The metaphysical desire has an-
other intention; it desires beyond everything that can simply complete
it. It is like goodness-the Desired does not fulfill it, but deepens it.
It is a generosity nourished by the Desired, and thus a relationship that
is not the disappearance of distance, not a bringing together, or-to
circumscribe more closely the essence of generosity and of goodness-a
relationship whose positivity comes from remoteness, from separation, for
it nourishes itself, one might say, with its hunger. This remoteness is
radical only if desire is not the possibility of anticipating the desirable,
if it does not think it beforehand, if it goes toward it aimlessly, that is, as
toward an absolute, unanticipatable alterity, as one goes forth unto
death. Desire is absolute if the desiring being is mortal and the Desired
invisible. Invisibility does not denote an absence of relation; it implies
relations with what is not given, of which there is no idea. Vision
is an adequation of the idea with the thing, a comprehension that
encompasses. N on-adequation does not denote a simple negation or an
obscurity of the idea, but-beyond the light and the night, beyond the
knowledge measuring beings-the inordinateness of Desire. Desire is
desire for the absolutely other. Besides the hunger one satisfies, the thirst
one quenches, and the senses one allays, metaphysics desires the other
beyond satisfactions, where no gesture by the body to diminish the
aspiration is possible, where it is not possible to sketch out any known
caress nor invent any new caress. A desire without satisfaction which,
precisely, understands [entend] the remoteness, the alterity, and the ex-
teriority of the other. For Desire this alterity, non-adequate to the idea,
has a meaning. It is understood as the alterity of the Other and of the
Most-High. The very dimension of height1 is opened up by meta-
1 " • • • in my opinion, that knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen

The Dialogues of Plato, New York, 1937.)

physical Desire. That this height is no longer the heavens but the
Invisible is the very elevation of height and its nobility. To die for the
invisible-this is metaphysics. This does not mean that desire can
dispense with acts. But these acts are neither consumption, nor caress,
nor liturgy.
Demented pretension to the invisible, when the acute experience of
the human in the twentieth century teaches that the thoughts of men are
borne by needs which explain society and history, that hunger and fear
can prevail over every human resistance and every freedom! There is no
question of doubting this human misery, this dominion the things and the
wicked exercise over man, this animality. But to be a man is to know
that this is so. Freedom consists in knowing that freedom is in peril.
But to know or to be conscious is to have time to avoid and forestall the
instant of inhumanity. It is this perpetual postponing of the hour of
treason-infinitesimal difference between man and non-man-that im-
plies the disinterestedness of goodness, the desire of the absolutely other
or nobility, the dimension of metaphysics.


2. The Breach of Totality
This absolute exteriority of the metaphysical term, the irreducibility of
movement to an inward play, to a simple presence of self to self, is, if
not demonstrated, claimed by the word transcendent. The metaphysical
movement is transcendent, and transcendence, like desire and inadequa-
tion, is necessarily a transascendence. 2 The transcendence with which
the metaphysician designates it is distinctive in that the distance it
expresses, unlike all distances, enters into the way of existing of the
exterior being. Its formal characteristic, to be other, makes up its
content. Thus the metaphysician and the other can not be totalized.
The metaphysician is absolutely separated.
The metaphysician and the other do not constitute a simple correlation,
which would be reversible. The reversibility of a relation where the
terms are indifferently read from left to right and from right to left
would couple them the one to the other,· they would complete one another
in a system visible from the outside. The intended transcendence would
be thus reabsorbed into the unity of the system, destroying the radical
2 We borrow this term from Jean Wahl. Cf. "Sur l'idee de la transcendance"

in Existence humaine et transcendance (Neuchatel, 1944). We have drawn
much inspiration from the themes evoked in that study.
36                          Totality and Infinity
alterity of the other. Irreversibility does not only mean that the same
goes unto the other differently than the other unto the same. That
eventuality does not enter into account: the radical separation between
the same and the other means precisely that it is impossible to place
oneself outside of the correlation between the same and the other so as to
record the correspondence or the non-correspondence of this going with
this return. Otherwise the same and the other would be reunited under
one gaze, and the absolute distance that separates them filled in.
The alterity, the radical heterogeneity of the other, is possible only if
the other is other with respect to a term whose essence is to remain at the
point of departure, to serve as entry into the relation, to be the same not
relatively but absolutely. A term can remain absolutely at the point of
departure of relationship only as I.
To be I is, over and beyond any individuation that can be derived from
a system of references, to have identity as one's content. The I is not a
being that always remains the same, but is the being whose existing
consists in identifying itself, in recovering its identity throughout all that
happens to it. It is the primal identity, the primordial work of identifi-
cation.
The I is identical in its very alterations. It represents them to itself
and thinks them. The universal identity in which the heterogenous can
be embraced has the ossature of a subject, of the first person. Universal
thought is an "I think."
The I is identical in its very alterations in yet another sense. The I
that thinks hearkens to itself thinking or takes fright before its depths
and is to itself an other. It thus discovers the famous naivete of its
thought, which thinks "straight on" as one "follows one's nose."* It
hearkens to itself thinking and surprises itself being dogmatic, foreign to
itself. But faced with this alterity the I is the same, merges with itself, is
incapable of apostasy with regard to this surprising "self." Hegelian
phenomenology, where self-consciousness is the distinguishing of what is
not distinct, expresses the universality of the same identifying itself in the
alterity of objects thought and despite the opposition of self to self. "I
distinguish myself from myself; and therein I am immediately aware that
this factor distinguished from me is not distinguished. I, the selfsame
being, thrust myself away from myself; but this which is distinguished,
which is set up as unlike me, is immediately on its being distinguished no

• "... qui pense 'devant elle', comme and marche 'devant soi'."

distinction for me." The difference is not a difference; the I, as other,
is not an "other." We will not retain from this citation Hegel's
affirmation of the provisional character of immediate evidence. The I
that repels the self, lived as repugnance, the I riveted to itself, lived as
ennui, are modes of self-consciousness and rest on the unrendable identity
of the I and the self. The alterity of the I that takes itself for another
may strike the imagination of the poet precisely because it is but the play
of the same: the negation of the I by the self is precisely one of the modes
of identification of the I.
The identification of the same in the I is not produced as a monoto-
nous tautology: "I am I." The originality of identification, irreducible
to the A is A formalism, would thus escape attention. It is not to be
fixed by reflecting on the abstract representation of self by self; it is nec-
essary to begin with the concrete relationship between an I and a world.
The world, foreign and hostile, should, in good logic, alter the I.
But the true and primordial relation between them, and that in which
the I is revealed precisely as preeminently the same, is produced as a
sojourn [sejour] in the world. The way of the I against the "other" of
the world consists in sojourning, in identifying oneself by existing here
at home with onself [chez soi]. In a world which is from the first other
the I is nonetheless autochthonous. It is the very reversion of this alter-
ation. It finds in the world a site [lieu] and a home [maison]. Dwell-
ing is the very mode of maintaining oneself [se tenir] ,* not as the famous
serpent grasping itself by biting onto its tail, but as the body that, on the
earth exterior to it, holds itself up [se tient] and can. The "at home"
[Le "chez soi"] is not a container but a site where I can~ where, depend-
ent on a reality that is other, I am, despite this dependence or thanks to
it, free. It is enough to walk, to do [faire], in order to grasp anything, to
take. In a sense everything is in the site, in the last analysis everything is
at my disposal, even the stars, if I but reckon them, calculate the inter-
mediaries or the means. The site, a medium [Le lieu, milieu], affords
means. Everything is here, everything belongs to me; everything is
caught up in advance with the primordial occupying of a site, everything

ed. (London & New York, 19SS), p. 211.
• "Se tenir" involves the notion of containing oneself; it is the idea of an ac-
tive identity with oneself. It also involves the notion of holding oneself up, of
standing, of having a stance-which is at the same time a position and an atti-
tude, a posture and an intention. Hence Levinas immediately passes to the idea
of the "I can" it implicates.-Trans.
38                           Totality and Infinity
is com-prehended.• The possibility of possessing, that is, of suspending
the very alterity of what is only at first other, and other relative to me, is
the way of the same. I am at home with myself in the world because
it offers itself to or resists possession. (What is absolutely other does
not only resist possession, but contests it, and accordingly can conse-
crate it.) This reversion of the alterity of the world to self-identifica-
tion must be taken seriously; the "moments" of this identification-the
body, the home, labor, possession, economy-are not to figure as empiri-
cal and contingent data, laid over the formal skeleton of the same; they
are the articulations of this structure. The identification of the same is
not the void of a tautology nor a dialectical opposition to the other, but
the concreteness of egoism. This is important for the possibility of
metaphysics. If the same would establish its identity by simple opposi-
tion to the other, it would already be a part of a totality encompassing
the same and the other. The pretension of metaphysical desire, with
which we began, the relationship with the absolutely other, would be
belied. But the metaphysician's separation from the metaphysical, which
is maintained within the relationship by being produced as an egoism, is
not the simple obverse of that relationship.
But how can the same, produced as egoism, enter into relationship
with an other without immediately divesting it of its alterity? What is
the nature of this relationship?
The metaphysical relation can not be properly speaking a representa-
tion, for the other would therein dissolve into the same: every representa-
tion is essentially interpretable as a transcendental constitution. The
other with which the metaphysician is in relationship and which he
recognizes as other is not simply in another locality; this other recalls
Plato's Ideas which, according to Aristotle's formula, are not in a site.
The sway [pouvoir] of the I will not cross the distance marked by the
alterity of the other. To be sure my own most inward sphere of intimacy
appears to me as foreign or hostile; usage-objects, foods, the very world
we inhabit are other in relation to us. But the alterity of the I and the
world inhabited is only formal; as we have indicated, in a world in which
I sojourn this alterity falls under my powers. The metaphysical other is
other with an alterity that is not formal, is not the simple reverse of iden-
tity, and is not formed out of resistance to the same, but is prior to every

pris."
A. Metaphysics and Transcendence                     39
1mt1at1ve, to all imperialism of the same. It is other with an alterity
constitutive of the very content of the other. Other with an alterity that
does not limit the same, for in limiting the same the other would not be
rigorously other: by virtue of the common frontier the other, within the
system, would yet be the same.
The absolutely other is the Other.* He and I do not form a number.
The collectivity in which I say "you" or "we" is not a plural of the "I."
I, you-these are not individuals of a common concept. Neither posses-
sion nor the unity of number nor the unity of concepts link me to the
Stranger [l'Etranger], the Stranger who disturbs the being at home
with oneself [le chez soi]. But Stranger also means the free one. Over
him I have no power.** He escapes my grasp by an essential dimension,
even if I have him at my disposal. He is not wholly in my site. But I,
who have no concept in common with the Stranger, am, like him, with-
out genus. We are the same and the other. The conjunction and here
designates neither addition nor power of one term over the other. We
shall try to show that the relation between the same and the other-upon
which we seem to impose such extraordinary conditions-is language.
For language accomplishes a relation such that the terms are not limi-
trophe within this relation, such that the other, despite the relationship
with the same, remains transcendent to the same. The relation between
the same and the other, metaphysics, is primordially enacted as conversa-
tion,t where the same, gathered up in its ipseity as an "I," as a particular
existent unique and autochthonous, leaves itself.
A relation whose terms do not form a totality can hence be produced
within the general economy of being only as proceeding from the I to the
other, as a face to face, as delineating a distance in depth-that of
conversation, of goodness, of Desire-irreducible to the distance the syn-
thetic activity of the understanding establishes between the diverse terms,
other with respect to one another, that lend themselves to its synoptic
operation. The I is not a contingent formation by which the same and
the other, as logical determinations of being, can in addition be reflected
within a thought. It is in order that alterity be produced in being that a
"thought" is needed and that an I is needed. The irreversibility of the
relation can be produced only if the relation is effected by one of
the terms as the very movement of transcendence, as the traversing of this
• "L'absolument Autre, c'est Autrui."
•• " . . . je ne peux pouvoir."
t discours-this term shall often be rendered by "discourse."
40                         Totality and Infinity
distance, and not as a recording of, or the psychological invention of
this movement. "Thought" and "interiority" are the very break-up
of being and the production ( not the reflection) of transcendence. We
know this relation only in the measure that we effect it; this is what is
distinctive about it. Alterity is possible only starting from me.
Conversation, from the very fact that it maintains the distance between
me and the Other, the radical separation asserted in transcendence which
prevents the reconstitution of totality, cannot renounce the egoism of its
existence; but the very fact of being in a conversation consists in recog-
nizing in the Other a right over this egoism, and hence in justifying one-
self. Apology, in which the I at the same time asserts itself and inclines
before the transcendent, belongs to the essence of conversation. The
goodness in which ( as we will see further) conversation issues and from
which it draws signification will not undo this apologetic moment.
The breach of totality is not an operation of thought, obtained by a
simple distinguishing of terms that evoke one another or at least line up
opposite one another. The void that breaks the totality can be main-
tained against an inevitably totalizing and synoptic thought only if
thought finds itself faced with an other refractory to categories. Rather
than constituting a total with this other as with an object, thought
consists in speaking. We propose to call "religion" the bond that is
established between the same and the other without constituting a total-
ity.
But to say that the other can remain absoli.ii:ely other, that he enters
only into the relationship of conversation, is to say that history itself, an
identification of the same, cannot claim to totalize the same and the
other. The absolutely other, whose alterity is overcome in the philoso-
phy of immanence on the allegedly common plane of history, maintains
his transcendence in the midst of history. The same is essentially
identification within the diverse, or history, or system. It is not I who
resist the system, as Kierkegaard thought; it is the other.


3. Transcendence ls Not Negativity
The movement of transcendence is to be distinguished from the nega-
tivity by which discontent man refuses the condition in which he is
established. Negativity presupposes a being established, placed in a site
where he is at home [chez soi]; it is an economic fact, in the etymological
sense of this adjective. Labor transforms the world, but is sustained by
A. Metaphysics and Transcendence                        41
the world it transforms. The labor that matter resists puts to profit the
resistance of materials; the resistance is still within the same. The
negator and the negated are posited together t form a system, that is, a
totality. The doctor who missed an engineering careert the poor man
who longs for wealtht the patient who suffers, the melancholic who is
bored for nothing oppose their condition while remaining attached to its
horizons. The "otherwise" and the "elsewhere" they wish still belong to
the here below they refuse. The desperate person who wills nothingness
or eternal life pronounces a total refusal of the here below; but deatht
for the one bent on suicide and for the believer, remains catastrophic.
God always calls us to Himself too soon; we want the here below. In
the horror of the radical unknown to which death leads is evinced the
limit of negativity.' This mode of negating while taking refuge in what
one negates delineates the same or the I. The alterity of a world refused
is not the alterity of the Stranger but that of the fatherland which wel-
comes and protects. Metaphysics does not coincide with negativity.
One may indeed endeavor to deduce the metaphysical alterity from
beings that are familiar to us, and thus contest its radical character. Is
not metaphysical alterity obtained by the superlative expression of perfec-
tions whose pale image fills the here below? But the negation of
imperfections does not suffice for the conception of this alterity.
Precisely perfection exceeds conception, overflows the concept; it desig-
nates distance: the idealization that makes it possible is a passage to the
limit, that is, a transcendence, a passage to the other absolutely other.
The idea of the perfect is an idea of infinity. The perfection designated
by this passage to the limit does not remain on the common plane of the
yes and the no at which negativity operates; on the contrary, the idea of
infinity designates a height and a nobility, a transascendence. The
Cartesian primacy of the idea of the perfect over the idea of the imper-
fect thus remains entirely valid. The idea of the perfect and of infinity
is not reducible to the negation of the imperfect; negativity is incapable
of transcendence. Transcendence designates a relation with a reality
infinitely distant from my own reality, yet without this distance destroy-
ing this relation and without this relation destroying this distance, as
would happen with relations within the same; this relation does not be-

'Cf. our remarks on death and the future in "Le Temps et l'Autre" (La
Choi:r, le monde, l'e:ristence [Grenoble, 1947], p. 166), which agree on so many
points with Blanchot's admirable analyses in Critique, t. VIII, n. 66 (Nov.,
19S2), pp. 91S ff.

come an implantation in the other and a confusion with him, does
not affect the very identity of the same, its ipseity, does not silence the
apology, does not become apostasy and ecstasy.
We have called this relation metaphysical. It is premature and in any
case insufficient to qualify it, by opposition to negativity, as positive. It
would be false to qualify it as theological. It is prior to the negative
or affirmative proposition; it first institutes language, where neither the
no nor the yes is the first word. The description of this relation is the
central issue of the present research.

4. Metaphysics Precedes Ontology
It is not by chance that the theoretical relation has been the preferred
schema of the metaphysical relation. Knowledge or theory designates
first a relation with being such that the knowing being lets the known
being manifest itself while respecting its alterity and without marking it
in any way whatever by this cognitive relation. In this sense metaphys-
ical desire would be the essence of theory. But theory also designates
comprehension [intelligence]-the logos of being-that is, a way of
approaching the known being such that its alterity with regard to the
knowing being vanishes. The process of cognition is at this stage
identified with the freedom of the knowing being encountering nothing
which, other with respect fo it, could limit it. This mode of depriving
the known being of its alterity can be accomplished only if it is aimed at
through a third term, a neutral term, which itself is not a being; in it the
shock of the encounter of the same with the other is deadened. This
third term may appear as a concept thought. Then the individual that
exists abdicates into the general that is thought. The third term may be
called sensation, in which objective quality and subjective affection are
merged. It may appear as Being distinguished from the existent: Being,
which at the same time is not ( that is, is not posited as an existent) and
yet corresponds to the work plied by the existent, which is not a
nothing. Being, which is without the density of existents, is the light in
which existents become intelligible. To theory as comprehension of
beings the general title ontology is appropriate. Ontology, which reduces
the other to the same, promotes freedom-the freedom that is the identi-
fication of the same, not allowing itself to be alienated by the other.
Here theory enters upon a course that renounces metaphysical Desire,
nmounces the marvel of exteriority from which that Desire lives.
A. Metaphysics and Transcendence                      4-3
But theory understood as a respect for exteriority delineates another
structure esse~tial for metaphysics. In its comprehension of being ( or
ontology) it is concerned with critique. It discovers the dogmatism and
naive arbitariness of its spontaneity, and calls into question the freedom
of the exercise of ontology; it then seeks to exercise this freedom in such a
way as to turn back at every moment to the origin of the arbitrary
dogmatism of this free exercise. This would lead to an infinite regres-
sion if this return itself remained an ontological movement, an exercise of
freedom, a theory. Its critical intention then leads it beyond theory and
ontology: critique does not reduce the other to the same as does ontology,
but calls into question the exercise of the same. A calling into question
of the same--which cannot occur within the egoist spontaneity of the
same--is brought about by the other. We name this calling into ques-
tion of my spontaneity by the presence of the Other ethics. The
strangeness of the Other, his irreducibility to the I, to my thoughts and
my possessions, is precisely accomplished as a calling into question of
my spontaneity, as ethics. Metaphysics, transcendence, the welcoming of
the other by the same, of the Other by me, is concretely produced as the
calling into question of the same by the other, that is, as the ethics that
accomplishes the critical essence of knowledge. And as critique precedes
dogmatism, metaphysics precedes ontology.
Western philosophy has most often been an ontology: a reduction of
the other to the same by interposition of a middle and neutral term that
ensures the comprehension of being.
This primacy of the same was Socrates's teaching: to receive nothing
of the Other hut what is in me, as though from all eternity I was in
possession of what comes to me from the outside--to receive nothing,
or to be free. Freedom does not resemble the capricious spontaneity of
free will; its ultimate meaning lies in this permanence in the same, which
is reason. Cognition is the deployment of this identity; it is freedom.
That reason in the last analysis would be the manifestation of a freedom,
neutralizing the other and encompassing him, can come as no surprise
once it was laid down that sovereign reason knows only itself, that
nothing other limits it. The neutralization of the other who becomes a
theme or an object-appearing, that is, taking its place in the light-is
precisely his reduction to the same. To know ontologically is to surprise
in an existent confronted that by which it is not this existent, this
stranger, that by which it is somehow betrayed, surrenders, is given in
the horizon in which it loses itself and appears, lays itself open to grasp,
44                         Totality and Infinity
becomes a concept. To know amounts to grasping being out of nothing
or reducing it to nothing, removing from it its alterity. This result is
obtained from the moment of the first ray of light. To illuminate is to
remove from being its resistance, because light opens a horizon and
empties space-delivers being out of nothingness. Mediation ( charac-
teristic of Western philosophy) is meaningful only if it is not limited to
reducing distances. For how could intermediaries reduce the intervals
between terms infinitely distant? Will not the intervals between the
mid-points progressively staked out ad infinitum appear always equally
untraversable? If an exterior and foreign being is to surrender itself to
intermediaries there must be produced somewhere a great "betrayal."
As far as the things are concerned, a surrender is carried out in their
conceptualization. As for man, it can be obtained by the terror that
brings a free man under the domination of another. For the things the
work of ontology consists in apprehending the individual ( which alone
exists) not in its individuality but in its generality ( of which alone there
is science). The relation with the other is here accomplished only through
a third term which I find in myself. The ideal of Socratic truth thus
rests on the essential self-sufficiency of the same, its identification in
ipseity, its egoism. Philosophy is an egology.
Berkeley's idealism, which passes for a philosophy of the immediate,
also answers to the ontological problem. Berkeley found in the very
qualities of objects the hold they offered to the I; in recognizing in
qualities, which remove the things from us most, their lived essence he
spanned the distance separating the subject from the object. The coin-
ciding of lived experience with itself was revealed to be a coinciding of
thought with an existent. The work of comprehension lay in this
coincidence. Thus Berkeley immerses all sensible qualities in the lived
experience of affection.
Phenomenological mediation follows another route, where the "onto-
logical imperialism" is yet more visible. It is the Being of existents
that is the medium of truth; truth regarding an existent presupposes
the prior openness of Being. To say that the truth of an existent
proceeds from the openness of Being is in any event to say that its
intelligibility is due not to our coinciding, but to our non-coinciding
with it. An existent is comprehended in the measure that thought
transcends it, measuring it against the horizon whereupon it is profiled.
Since Husserl the whole of phenomenology is the promotion of the idea
of horizon, which for it plays a role equivalent to that of the concept in
A. Metaphysics and Transcendence                         45
classical idealism; an existent arises upon a ground that extends beyond
it, as an individual arises from a concept. But what commands the
non-coinciding of thought with the existent-the Being of the existent,
which guarantees the independence and the extraneity of the existent-is
a phosphorescence, a luminosity, a generous effulgence. The existing of
an existant is converted into intelligibility; its independence is a surren-
der in radiation. To broach an existent from Being is simultane-
ously to let it be and to comprehend it. Reason seizes upon an existent
through the void and nothingness of existing-wholly light and phospho-
rescence. Approached from Being, from the luminous horizon where
it has a silhouette, but has lost its face, an existent is the very appeal
that is addressed to comprehension. Being and Time has argued perhaps
but one sole thesis: Being is inseparable from the comprehension of Being
( which unfolds as time) ; Being is already an appeal to subjectivity.
The primacy of ontology for Heidegger 5 does not rest on the truism:
"to know an existent it is necessary to have comprehended the Being of
existents." To affirm the priority of Being over existents is to
already decide the essence of philosophy; it is to subordinate the relation
with someone, who is an existent, ( the ethical relation) to a relation with
the Being of existents, which, impersonal, permits the apprehension,
the domination of existents (a relationship of knowing), subordinates
justice to freedom. If freedom denotes the mode of remaining the same
in the midst of the other, knowledge, where an existent is given by
interposition of impersonal Being, contains the ultimate sense of freedom.
It would be opposed to justice, which involves obligations with regard to
an existent that refuses to give itself, the Other, who in this sense would
be an existent par excellence. In subordinating every relation with
existents to the relation with Being the Heideggerian ontology affirms
the primacy of freedom over ethics. To be sure, the freedom involved in
the essence of truth is not for Heidegger a principle of free will. Free-
dom comes from an obedience to Being: it is not man who possesses
freedom; it is freedom that possesses man. But the dialectic which thus
reconciles freedom and obedience in the concept of truth presupposes
the primacy of the same, which marks the direction of and defines the
whole of Western philosophy.
The relation with Being that is enacted as ontology consists in neutral-

11 Cf. our article "L'ontologie est-elle fondamentale ?" in the Revue de Mita-

physique et de Morale (janvier, 19Sl).
46                        Totality and Infinity
izing the existent in order to comprehend or grasp it. It is hence not ~
relation with the other as such but the reduction of the other to the same.
Such is the definition of freedom: to maintain oneself against the other,
despite every relation with the other to ensure the autarchy of an I.
Thematization and conceptualization, which moreover are inseparable,
are not peace with the other but suppression or possession of the other.
For possession affirms the other, but within a negation of its independ-
ence. "I think" comes down to "I can"-to an appropriation of what is,
to an exploitation of reality. Ontology as first philosophy is a philosophy
of power. It issues in the State and in the non-violence of the totality,
without securing itself against the violence from which this non-violence
lives, and which appears in the tyranny of the State. Truth, which
should reconcile persons, here exists anonymous! y. Universality presents
itself as impersonal; and this is another inhumanity.
The "egoism" of ontology is maintained even when, denouncing So-
cratic philosophy as already forgetful of Being and already on the way to
the notion of the "subject" and technological power, Heidegger finds
in Presocratism thought as obedience to the truth of Being. This
obedience would be accomplished in existing as builder and cultivator,
effecting the unity of the site which sustains space. In bringing together
presence on the earth and under the firmament of the heavens, the wait-
ing for the gods and the company of mortals in the presence to the things
-which is to build and to cultivate-Heidegger, with the whole of
Western history, takes the relation with the Other as enacted in the
destiny of sedentary peoples, the possessors and builders of the earth.
Possession is preeminently the form in which the other becomes the
same, by becoming mine. In denouncing the sovereignty of the techno-
logical powers of man Heidegger exalts the pre-technological powers of
possession. His analyses do not start with the thing-object, to be sure,
but they bear the mark of the great landscapes to which the things refer.
Ontology becomes ontology of nature, impersonal fecundity, faceless
generous mother, matrix of particular beings, inexhaustible matter for
things.
A philosophy of power, ontology is, as first philosophy which does not
call into question the same, a philosophy of injustice. Even though it
opposes the technological passion issued forth from the forgetting of
Being hidden by existents, Heideggerian ontology, which subordinates
the relationship with the Other to the relation with Being in general,
remains under obedience to the anonymous, and leads inevitably to
A. Metaphysics and Transcendence                      47
another power, to imperialist domination, to tyranny. Tyranny is not
the pure and simple extension of technology to reified men. I ts origin
lies back in the pagan "moods," in the enrootedness in the earth, in the
adoration that enslaved men can devote to their masters. Being before
the existent, ontology before metaphysics, is freedom (be it the freedom
of theory) before justice. It is a movement within the same before
obligation to the other.
The terms must be reversed. For the philosophical tradition the
conflicts between the same and the other are resolved by theory whereby
the other is reduced to the same-or, concretely, by the community of the
State, where beneath anonymous power, though it be intelligible, the I
rediscovers war in the tyrannic oppression it undergoes from the totality.
Ethics, where the same takes the irreducible Other into account, would
belong to opinion. The effort of this book is directed toward apperceiv-
ing in discourse a non-allergic relation with alterity, toward apperceiving
Desire-where power, by essence murderous of the other, becomes, faced
with the other and "against all good sense," the impossibility of murder,
the consideration of the other, or justice. Concretely our effort consists
in maintaining, within anonymous community, the society of the I
with the Other-language and goodness. This relation is not prephilo-
sophical, for it does not do violence to the I, is not imposed upon it
brutally from the outside, despite itself, or unbeknown to it, as an
opinion; more exactly, it is imposed upon the I beyond all violence by a
violence that calls it entirely into question. The ethical relation, opposed
to first philosophy which identifies freedom and power, is not contrary
to truth; it goes unto being in its absolute exteriority, and accomplishes
the very intention that animates the movement unto truth.
The relationship with a being infinitely distant, that is, overflowing its
idea, is such that its authority as an existent is already invoked in every
question we could raise concerning the meaning of its Being. One does
not question oneself concerning him ; one questions him. Always he
faces. If ontology-the comprehension, the embracing of Being-is
impossible, it is not because every definition of Being already presupposes
the knowledge of Being, as Pascal had said and Heidegger refutes in
the first pages of Being and Time; it is because the comprehension of
Being in general cannot dominate the relationship with the Other. The
latter relationship commands the first. I cannot disentangle myself from
society with the Other, even when I consider the Being of the existent he
is. Already the comprehension of Being is said to the existent, who again
48                        Totality and Infinity
arises behind the theme in which he is presented. This "saying to the
Other"-this relationship with the Other as interlocutor, this relation
with an existent-precedes all ontology; it is the ultimate relation in
Being. Ontology presupposes metaphysics.


5. Transcendence as the Idea of Infinity
The schema of theory in which metaphysics was found distinguished
theory from all ecstatic behavior. Theory excludes the implantation
of the knowing being in the known being, the entering into the Beyond
by ecstasy. It remains knowledge, relationship. To be sure, representa-
tion does not constitute the primordial relation with being. It is none-
theless privileged, precisely as the possibility of recalling the separation
of the I. And to have substituted for the magical communion of species
and the confusion of distinct orders a spiritual relation in which beings
remain at their post but communicate among themselves will have
been the imperishable merit of the "admirable Greek people," and the
very institution of philosophy. In condemning suicide, at the beginning
of the Phaedo, Socrates refuses the false spiritualism of the pure and
simple and immediate union with the Divine, characterized as desertion;
he proclaims ineluctable the difficult itinerary of knowledge starting
from the here below. The knowing being remains separated from the
known being. The ambiguity of Descartes's first evidence, revealing
the I and God in turn without merging them, revealing them as two
distinct moments of evidence mutually founding one another, charac-
terizes the very meaning of separation. The separation of the I is thus
affirmed to be non-contingent, non-provisional. The distance between
me and God, radical and necessary, is produced in being itself. Philo-
sophical transcendence thereby differs from the transcendence of religions
( in the current thaumaturgic and generally lived sense of this term),
from the transcendence that is already ( or still) participation, sub-
mergence in the being toward which it goes, which holds the transcend-
ing being in its invisible meshes, as to do it violence.
This relation of the same with the other, where the transcendence of
the relation does not cut the bonds a relation implies, yet where these
bonds do not unite the same and the other into a Whole, is in fact fixed
in the situation described by Descartes in which the "I think" maintains
with the Infinite it can nowise contain and from which it is separated a
relation called "idea of infinity." To be sure, things, mathematical and
A. Metaphysics and Transcendence                    49
moral notions are also, according to Descartes, presented to us through
their ideas, and are distinct from them. But the idea of infinity is
exceptional in that its ideatum surpasses its idea, whereas for the things
the total coincidence of their "objective" and "formal" realities is not
precluded; we could conceivably have accounted for all the ideas, other
than that of Infinity, by ourselves. Without deciding anything for
the moment as to the veritable significance of the presence of the ideas of
things in us, without holding to the Cartesian argumentation that
proves the separated existence of the Infinite by the finitude of the being
having an idea of infinity ( for there perhaps is not much sense to proving
an existence by describing a situation prior to proof and to the problems
of existence), it is of importance to emphasize that the transcendence of
the Infinite with respect to the I which is separted from it and which
thinks it measures (so to speak) its very infinitude. The distance that
separates ideatum and idea here constitutes the content of the ideatum
itself. Infinity is characteristic of a transcendent being as transcendent;
the infinite is the absolutely other. The transcendent is the sole ideatum
of which there can be only an idea in us; it is infinitely removed from its
idea, that is, exterior, because it is infinite.
To think the infinite, the transcendent, the Stranger, is hence not
to think an object. But to think what does not have the lineaments of an
object is in reality to do more or better than think. The distance of tran•
scendence is not equivalent to that which separates the mental act from
its object in all our representations, since the distance at which the object
stands does not exclude, and in reality implies, the possession of the
object, that is, the suspension of its being. The "intentionality" of tran-
scendence is unique in its kind; the difference between objectivity and
transcendence will serve as a general guideline for all the analyses of this
work. We find that this presence in thought of an idea whose ideatum
overflows the capacity of thought is given expression not only in Aris-
totle's theory of the agent intellect, but also, very often, in Plato.
Against a thought that proceeds from him who "has his own head to
himself,"6 he affirms the value of the delirium that comes from God,
"winged thought.m Delirium here does not have an irrationalist signifi-
cance; it is only a "divine release of the soul from the yoke of custom and
convention."8 The fourth type of delirium is reason itself, rising to the
G Pftaedrus, 244a.

8 Phaedrus, 265a.
50                             Totality and Infinity
ideas, thought in the highest sense. Possession by a god, enthusiasm, is
not the irrational, but the end of the solitary ( and which we will later
call "economic") or inward thought, the beginning of a true experience
of the new and of the noumenon-already Desire.
The Cartesian notion of the idea of the Infinite designates a relation
with a being that maintains its total exteriority with respect to him who
thinks it. It designates the contact with the intangible, a contact that
does not compromise the integrity of what is touched. To affirm the
presence in us of the idea of infinity is to deem purely abstract and formal
the contradiction the idea of metaphysics is said to harbor, which Plato
brings up in the Parmenides 9-that the relation with the Absolute would
render the Absolute relative. The absolute exteriority of the exterior
being is not purely and simply lost as a result of its manifestation; it
"absolves" itself from the relation in which it presents itself. But the
infinite distance of the Stranger despite the proximity achieved by the
idea of infinity, the complex structure of the unparalleled relation desig-
nated by this idea, has to be described; it is not enough to distinguish
it formally from objectification.
We must now indicate the terms which will state the deformalization
or the concretization of the idea of infinity, this apparently wholly empty
notion. The infinite in the finite, the more in the less, which is ac-
complished by the idea of Infinity, is produced as Desire-not a Desire
that the possession of the Desirable slakes, but the Desire for the
Infinite which the desirable arouses rather than satisfies. A Desire
perfectly disinterested-goodness. But Desire and goodness concretely
presuppose a relationship in which the Desirable arrests the "negativity"
of the I that holds sway in the Same-puts an end to power and emprise.
This is positively produced as the possession of a world I can bestow as a
gift on the Other-that is, as a presence before a face. For the presence
before a face, my orientation toward the Other, can lose the avidity
proper to the gaze only by turning into generosity, incapable of approach-
ing the other with empty hands. This relationship established over the
things henceforth possibly common, that is, susceptible of being said, is
the relationship of conversation. The way in which the other presents
himself, exceeding the idea of the other in me, we here name face. This
mode does not consist in figuring as a theme under my gaze, in spreading
itself forth as a set of qualities forming a~ image. The face of the

11 Parmenides,   133b-13Sc, 141e-142b.
A.Metaphysics and Transcendence                       51
Other at each moment destroys and overflows the plastic image it leaves
me, the idea existing to my own measure and to the measure of its
ideatum-the adequate idea. It does not manifest itself by these
qualities, but Ka()' ah6. It expresses itself. The face brings a notion
of truth which, in contradistinction to contemporary ontology, is not the
disclosure of an impersonal Neuter, but expression: the existent breaks
through all the envelopings and generalities of Being to spread out in
its "form" the totality of its "content," finally abolishing the distinc-
tion between form and content. This is not achieved by some sort of
modification of the knowledge that thematizes, but precisely by "themat-
ization" turning into conversation. The condition for theoretical truth
and error is the word of the other, his expression, which every lie already
presupposes. But the first content of expression is the expression itself.
To approach the Other in conversation is to welcome his expression, in
which at each instant he overflows the idea a thought would carry away
from it. It is therefore to receive from the Other beyond the capacity of
the I, which means exactly: to have the idea of infinity. But this also
means : to be taught. The relation with the Other, or Conversation, is a
non-allergic relation, an ethical relation; but inasmuch as it is welcomed
this conversation is a teaching [enseignement]. Teaching is not reducible
to maieutics; it comes from the exterior and brings me more than I
contain. In its non-violent transitivity the very epiphany of the face
is produced. The Aristotelian analysis of the intellect, which discovers
the agent intellect coming in by the gates, absolutely exterior, and yet con-
stituting, nowise compromising, the sovereign activity of reason, already
substitutes for maieutics a transitive action of the master, since reason,
without abdicating, is found to be in a position to receive.
Finally, infinity, overflowing the idea of infinity, puts the spontaneous
freedom within us into question. It commands and judges it and brings
it to its truth. The analysis of the idea of Infinity, to which we gain
access only starting from an I, will be terminated with the surpassing of
the subjective.
The notion of the face, to which we will refer throughout this work,
opens other perspectives: it brings us to a notion of meaning prior to
my Sinngehung and thus independent of my initiative and my power. It
signifies the philosophical priority of the existent over Being, an exterior-
ity that does not call for power or possession, an exteriority that is
not reducible, as with Plato, to the interiority of memory, and yet
maintains the I who welcomes it. It finally makes possible the descrip-
52                          Totality and Infinity
tion of the notion of the immediate. The philosophy of the immediate is
realized neither in Berkeley's idealism nor in modern ontology. To
say that the existent is disclosed only in the openness of Being is to
say that we are never directly with the existent as such. The immediate
is the interpellation and, if we may speak thus, the imperative of lan-
guage. The idea of contact does not represent the primordial mode of
the immediate. Contact is already a thematization and a reference to a
horizon. The immediate is the face to face.
Between a philosophy of transcendence that situates elsewhere the true
life to which man, escaping from here, would gain access in the privi-
leged moments of liturgical, mystical elevation, or in dying-and a
philosophy of immanence in which we would truly come into possession of
being when every "other" ( cause for war), encompassed by the same,
would vanish at the end of history-we propose to describe, within the
unfolding of terrestrial existence, of economic existence ( as we shall call
it), a relationship with the other that does not result in a divine or
human totality, that is not a totalization of history but the idea of infinity.
Such a relationship is metaphysics itself. History would not be the
privileged plane where Being disengaged from the particularism of
points of view ( with which reflection would still be affected) is mani-
fested. If it claims to integrate myself and the other within an imper-
sonal spirit this alleged integration is cruelty and injustice, that is, ignores
the Other. History as a relationship between men ignores a position of
the I before the other in which the other remains transcendent with
respect to me. Though of myself I am not exterior to history, I do find
in the Other a point that is absolute with regard to history-not by amal-
gamating with the Other, but in speaking with him. History is worked
over by the ruptures of history, in which a judgment is borne upon it.
When man truly approaches the Other he is uprooted from history.
## B. Separation And Discourse


1. Atheism or the Will
The idea of Infinity implies the separation of the same with regard
to the other, but this separation cannot rest on an opposition to the other
which would be purely anti-thetical. Thesis and antithesis, in repelling
one another, call for one another. They appear in opposition to a
synoptic gaze that encompasses them; they already form a totality
which, by integrating the metaphysical transcendence expressed by the
idea of infinity, relativizes it. An absolute transcendence has to be
produced as non-integrateable. If separation then is necessitated by the
production of Infinity overflowing its idea and therefore separated
from the I inhabited by this idea ( the preeminently inadequate idea),
this separation must be accomplished in the I in a way that would not
only be correlative and reciprocal to the transcendence in which the
infinite maintains itself with respect to its idea in me, it must not only be
the logical rejoinder of that transcendence; the separation of the I with
regard to the other must result from a positive movement. Correlation
does not suffice as a category for transcendence.
A separation of the I that is not the reciprocal of the transcendence of
the other with regard to me is not an eventuality thought of only by
quintessential abstractors. It imposes itself upon meditation in the name
of a concrete moral experience: what I permit myself to demand of
myself is not comparable with what I have the right to demand of the
Other. This moral experience, so commonplace, indicates a metaphysical
asymmetry: the radical impossibility of seeing oneself from the outside
and of speaking in the same sense of oneself and of the others, and
consequently the impossibility of totalization-and, on the plane of social
experience, the impossibility of forgetting the intersubjective experience
that leads to that social experience and endows it with meaning (as, to
believe the phenomenologists, perception, impossible to conjure away,
endows scientific experience with meaning).
53
54                          Totality and Infinity
The separation of the Same is produced in the form of an inner life,
a psychism. The psychism constitutes an event in being; it concretizes a
conjuncture of terms which were not first defined by the psychism and
whose abstract formulation harbors a paradox. The original role of the
psychism does not, in fact, consist in only reflecting being; it is already a
way of being [une maniere d'etre], resistance to the totality. Thought
or the psychism opens the dimension this way requires. The dimension
of the psychism opens under the force of the resistance a being opposes to
its totalization; it is the feat of radical separation. The cogito, we said,
evinces separation. The being infinitely surpassing its own idea in us-
God in the Cartesian terminology-subtends the evidence of the cogito,
according to the third Meditation. But the discovery of this meta-
physical relation in the cogito constitutes chronologically only the second
move of the philosopher. That there could be a chronological order
distinct from the "logical" order, that there could be several moments
in the progression, that there is a progression-here is separation. For
by virtue of time this being is not yet-which does not make it the
same as nothingness, but maintains it at a distance from itself. It is
not all at once. Even its cause, older than itself, is still to come. The
cause of being is thought or known by its effect as though it were poste-
rior to its effect. We speak lightly of the possibility of this "as though,"
which is taken to indicate an illusion. But this illusion is not unfounded;
it constitutes a positive event. The posteriority of the anterior-an in-
version logically absurtl-is produced, one would say, only by memory
or by thought. But the "improbable" phenomenon of memory or of
thought must precisely be interpreted as a revolution in being. Thus
already theoretical thought-but in virtue of a still more profound
structure that sustains it, the psychism-articulates separation. Separa-
tion is not reflected in thought, but produced by it. For in it the After or
the Effect cAhditions the Before or the Cause: the Before appears and
is only welcomed. Likewise, by virtue of the psychism the being that is
in a site rema(ns free with regard to that site; posited in a site in which
it maintains i&elf, it is1 that which comes thereto from elsewhere. The
present of the cogito, despite the support it discovers for itself after the
fact in the a~solute that transcends it, maintains itself all by itself-
be it only for an instant, the space of a cogito. That there could
be this instant of sheer youth, heedless of its slipping into the past and
of its recovered self-possession in the future {and that this uprooting
be necessary·if the I of the cogito is to cling to the absolute), in short,
B. Separation and Discourse                        55
that there be the very order or distance of time-all this articulates the
ontological separation between the metaphysician and the metaphysical.
The conscious being may very well involve something unconscious and
implicit, and one may denounce as much as one likes its freedom as al-
ready enchained to an ignored determinism; ignorance here is a detach-
ment, incomparable to the self-ignorance in which things lie. It is
founded in the interiority of a psychism; it is positive in the enjoyment
of itself. The imprisoned being, ignorant of its prison, is at home with
itself. I ts power for illusion-if illusion there was-constitutes its
separation.
The being that thinks at first seems to present itself, to a gaze that
conceives it, as integrated into a whole. In reality it is so integrated only
once it is dead. Life permits it an as-for-me, a leave of absence, a
postponement, which precisely is interiority. Totalization is accom-
plished only in history-in the history of the historiographers, that is,
among the survivors. It rests on the affirmation and the conviction
that the chronological order of the history of the historians outlines the
plot of being in itself, analogous to nature. The time of universal
history remains as the ontological ground in which particular existences
are lost, are computed, and in which at least their essences are recapitu-
lated. Birth. arid death 'as punctual moments, and the interval that
separates thetii, are lodged iq this universal time of the historian, who is a
survivor. Interiotity as such is a "nothing," "pure thought," nothing
but thought. In the time of the historiographer interiority is the non-
being in which everything is possible, for in it nothing is impossible-the
"everything is pos;iblen of madness. This possibility is not an essence,
that is, is not the possibility of a being. But for there to be a separated
being, for the totalization of history to not be the ultimate schema of
being, it is necessary that death which for the survivor is an end be not
only this end; it is n~ssafy that there be in dying another direction than
that which le'ads ttl the end as to a point of impact in the duration of
survivors. Separ::i:tion desighates the possibility of an eiistent being set
up and having its own Je~t1hy to itself, that is, bein"g born and dying
without the place of this birth and this death in the time of universal
history being the measure of its reality. lnteriority is the very possibility
of a birth and a death that do not derive their meaning from history.
lnteriority institutes an order different from historical time in which
totality is constituted, an order where everything is pending, where
what is no longer possible historically remains always possible. The
56                        Totality and Infinity
birth of a separated being that must proceed from nothingness, absolute
beginning, is an event historically absurd. So also is the activity issuing
from a will which, within historical continuity, at each instant marks
the point of a new origin. These paradoxes are overcome by the
psych ism.
Memory recaptures and reverses and suspends what is already accom-
plished in birth-in nature. Fecundity escapes the punctual instant of
death. By memory I ground myself after the event, retroactively: I
assume today what in the absolute past of the origin had no subject to
receive it and had therefore the weight of a fatality. By memory I
assume and put back in question. Memory realizes impossibility: mem-
ory, after the event, assumes the passivity of the past and masters it.
Memory as an inversion of historical time is the essence of interiority.
In the totality of the historiographer the death of the other is an end,
the point at which the separated being is cast into the totality, and at
which, consequently, dying can be passed through and past, the point
from which the separated being will continue by virtue of the heritage his
existence had amassed. But the psychism extracts an existence resistant
to a fate that would consist in becoming "nothing but past"; interiority is
the refusal to be transformed into a pure loss figuring in an alien
accounting system. The death agony is precisely in this impossibility
of ceasing, in the ambiguity of a time that has run out and of a
mysterious time that yet remains; death is consequently not reduci-
ble to the end of a being. What "still remains" is totally different from
the future that one welcomes, that one projects forth and in a certain
measure draws from oneself. For a being to whom everything happens
in conformity with projects, death is an absolute event, absolutely a
posteriori, open to no power, not even to negation. Dying is agony
because in dying a being does not come to an end while coming to an
end; he has no more time, that is, can no longer wend his way
anywhere, but thus he goes where one cannot go, suffocates-how much
longer. . . . The non-reference to the common time of history means
that mortal existence unfolds in a dimension that does not run parallel to
the time of history and is not situated with respect to this time as to an
absolute. This is why the life between birth and death is neither folly
nor absurdity nor flight nor cowardice. It flows on in a dimension of its
own where it has meaning, and where a triumph over death can have
meaning. This triumph is not a new possibility offered after the end of
every possibility-but a resurrection in the son in whom the rupture of
B. Separation and Discourse                         57
death is embodied. Death-suffocation in the impossibility of the possi-
ble-opens a passage toward descent. Fecundity is yet a personal rela-
tion, though it be not given to the "I"* as a possibility.1
There would be no separated being if the time of the One could fall
into the time of the other. This is what was expressed, always nega-
tively, by the idea of the eternity of the soul: the dead one's refusal to
fall into the time of the other, the personal time free from common
time. If the common time were to absorb the time of the "I"** death
would be the end. But if refusal to be purely and simply integrated
into history would indicate the continuation of life after death or its
preexistence prior to its beginning in terms of the time of the survivor,
then commencement and end would in no wise have marked a separation
that could be characterized as radical and a dimension that would be
interiority. For this would still be to insert the interiority into the time
of history, as though perenniality throughout a time common to the
plurality-the totality-dominated the fact of separation.
The non-correspondance of death to an end a survivor observes hence
does not mean that the existence that is mortal but incapable of passing
away would still be present after its death, that the mortal being would
survive the death that strikes at the hour common to men. And one
would be wrong to situate the interior time within objective time, as
Husserl does, and so to prove the eternity of the soul.
Commencement and end taken as points of universal time reduce the I
to the third person, such as it is spoken of by the survivor. lnteriority is
essentially bound to the first person of the I. The separation is radical
only if each being has its own time, that is, its interiority, if each time is
not absorbed into the universal time. By virtue of the dimension of
interiority each being declines the concept and withstands totalization-a
refusal necessary for the idea of Infinity, which does not produce this
separation by its own force. The psychic life, which makes birth and
death possible, is a dimension in being, a dimension of non-essence,
beyond the possible and the impossible. It does not exhibit itself in
history; the discontinuity of the inner life interrupts historical time.
The thesis of the primacy of history constitutes an option for the
comprehension of being in which interiority is sacrificed. The present
work proposes another option. The real must not only be determined

in its historical objectivity, but also from interior intentions, from the
secrecy that interrupts the continuity of historical time. Only on the ba-
sis of this secrecy is the pluralism of society possible. It attests this
secrecy. We have always known that it is impossible to form an idea
of the human totality, for men have an inner life closed to him who
does, however, grasp the comprehensive movements of human groups.
The way of access to social reality starting with the separation of the I is
not engulfed in "universal history," in which only totalities appear. The
experience of the other starting from a separated I remains a source of
meaning for the comprehension of totalities, just as concrete perception
remains determinative for the signification of scientific universes.
Cronos, thinking he swallows a god, swallows but a stone.
The interval of discretion or of death is a third notion between being
and nothingness.
The interval is not to life what potency is to act. Its originality
consists in being between two times. We propose to call this dimension
dead time. The rupture of historical and totalized duration, which
dead time marks, is the very rupture that creation operates in being.
The discontinuity of Cartesian time, which requires a continuous crea-
tion, indicates the very dispersion and plurality of created being. Each
instant of historical time in which action commences is, in the last
analysis, a birth, and hence breaks the continuous time of history, a time
of works and not of wills. The inner life is the unique way for the
real to exist as a plurality. We shall later study closely this separation
that is an ipseity, in the fundamental phenomenon of enjoyment.2
One can call atheism this separation so complete that the separated
being maintains itself in existence all by itself, without participating in
the Being from which it is separated-eventually capable of adhering to
it by belief. The break with participation is implied in this capability.
One lives outside of God, at home with oneself; one is an I, an egoism.
The soul, the dimension of the psychic, being an accomplishment of
separation, is naturally atheist. By atheism we thus understand a posi-
tion prior to both the negation and the affirmation of the divine, the
breaking with participation by which the I posits itself as the same and as
I.
It is certainly a great glory for the creator to have set up a being
capable of atheism, a being which, without having been causa sui, has an

2   Cf. Section II.
B. Separation and Discourse                    59
independent view and word and is at home with itself. We name "will" a
being conditioned in such a way that without being causa sui it is first
with respect to its cause. The psychism is the possibility for such a
being.
The psychism will be specified as sensibility, the element of enjoyment,
as egoism. In the egoism of enjoyment dawns the ego, source of the will.
It is the psychism and not matter that provides a principle of individua-
tion. The particularity of the TOGE TL does not prevent the singular
beings from being integrated into a whole, from existing in function of
the totality, in which this singularity vanishes. Individuals belong-
ing to the extension of a concept are one through this concept;
concepts, in their turn, are one in their hierarchy; their multiplicity
forms a whole. If the individuals of the extension of the concept owe
their individuality to an accidental or an essential attribute, this attribute
nowise opposes the unity latent in their multiplicity. This unity will
be actualized in the knowing of an impersonal reason, which integrates
the particularities of the individuals in becoming their idea or in totaliz-
ing them by history. The absolute interval of separation cannot be
obtained by distinguishing the terms of the multiplicity by some qualita-
tive specification that would be ultimate, as in Leibniz's Monadology,
where a difference, without which one monad would remain indistin-
guishable from an "other," is inherent in the terms. 3 As qualities the
differences still refer to the community of a genus. The monads, echos of
the divine substance, form a totality within its thought. The plurality
required for conversation results from the interiority with which each
term is "endowed," the psychism, its egoist and sensible self-reference.
Sensibility constitutes the very egoism of the I, which is sentient and not
something sensed. Man as measure of all things, that is, measured
by nothing, comparing all things but incomparable, is affirmed in the
sensing of sensation. Sensation breaks up every system; Hegel places
at the origin of his dialectic the sensed, and not the unity of sensing
and sensed in sensation. It is not by chance that in the Theaetetus 4
Protagoras's and Heraclitus's theses are brought together, as though
the singularity of the sentient would be required for Parmedidean being
to be able to be pulverized into becoming and to unfold otherwise than
as an objective flux of things. A multiplicity of sentients would be the

8 Monadology,   art. 8.

very mode in which a becoming is possible-a becoming in which thought
would not simply find again, now in movement, a being subject to a
universal law, producing unity. Only in this way does becoming acquire
the value of an idea radically opposed to the idea of being, does it
designate the resistance to every integration expressed by the image of
the river, in which, according to Heraclitus, one does not bathe twice,
and according to Cratylus, not even once. A notion of becoming
destructive of Parmenidean monism is acquired only through the singu-
larity of sensation.


2. Truth
We shall show further how separation or ipseity is produced primordi-
ally in the enjoyment of happiness, how in this enjoyment the separated
being affirms an independence that owes nothing, neither dialectically nor
logically, to the other which remains transcendent to it. This absolute
independence, which does not posit itself by opposing, and which we have
called atheism, does not exhaust its essence in the formalism of
abstract thought. It is accomplished in all the plenitude of economic
existence. 5
While the atheist independence of the separated being does not
posit itself by opposition to the idea of infinity, it alone makes possible the
relation denoted by this idea. The atheist separation is required by the
idea of Infinity, but is not dialectically brought about by it. The idea
of Infinity, the relation between the same and the other, does not
undo the separation attested in transcendence. Indeed the same can
rejoin the other only in the hazards and risks of the quest for truth;
it does not rest on the other in complete security. Without separation
there would not have been truth; there would have been only being.
Truth, a lesser contact than tangency, in the risk of ignorance, illusion,
and error, does not undo "distance," does not result in the union of the
knower and the known, does not issue in totality. Despite the theses of
the philosophy of existence, this contact is not nourished from a prior
enrootedness in being. The quest for truth unfolds in the apparition of
forms. The distinctive characteristic of forms is precisely their epiphany
at a distance. Enrootedness, a primordial preconnection, would maintain
participation as one of the sovereign categories of being, whereas the

11
Cf. Section II.
B. Separation and Discourse                          61
notion of truth marks the end of this reign. Participation is a way of
referring to the other: it is to have and unfold one's own being without
at any point losing contact with the other. To break with participation
is, to be sure, to maintain contact, but no longer derive one's being
from this contact: it is to see without being seen, like Gyges. 6 For this it
is necessary that a being, though it be a part of a whole, derive its being
from itself and not from its frontiers (not from its definition), exist
independently, depend neither on relations that designate its place within
Being nor on the recognition that the Other would bring it. The myth
of Gyges is the very myth of the I and interiority, which exist non-
recognized. They are, to be sure, the eventuality of all unpunished
crimes, but such is the price of interiority, which is the price of separa-
tion. The inner life, the I, separation are uprootedness itself, non-par-
ticipation, and consequently the ambivalent possibility of error and of
truth. The knowing subject is not a part of a whole, for it is limitrophe
of nothing. Its aspiration to truth is not the hollowed-out outline of the
being it lacks. Truth presupposes a being autonomous in separation; the
quest for a truth is precisely a relation that does not rest on the privation
of need. To seek and to obtain truth is to be in a relation not because
one is defined by something other than oneself, but because in a certain
sense one lacks nothing.
But the quest for truth is an event more fundamental than theory,
even though theoretical research is a privileged mode of the relation
with exteriority we name truth. Because the separation of the separated
being has not been relative, has not been a movement away from the
other, but was produced as psychism, the relation with the other does not
consist in repeating the movement apart in a reverse direction, but in
going toward the other in Desire. Theory itself derives the exteriority
of its term from this movement, for the idea of exteriority which guides
the quest for truth is possible only as the idea of Infinity. The conversion
of the soul to exteriority, to the absolutely other, to Infinity, is not
deducible from the very identity of the soul, for it is not commensurate
with the soul. The idea of infinity hence does not proceed from the I,
nor from a need in the I gauging exactly its own voids; here the move-
ment proceeds from what is thought and not from the thinker. It is
the unique knowledge that presents this inversion-a knowledge without

6 By contrast the things may poetically be called "blind persons." Cf. J. Wahl,

"Dictionnaire subjectif," in Poesie, pensee, perception (Paris, 1948).
62                         Totality and Infinity
a priori. The idea of Infinity is revealed~ in the strong sense of the
term. There is no natural religion. But this exceptional knowledge is
thus no longer objective. Infinity is not the "object" of a cognition
( which would be to reduce it to the measure of the gaze that contem-
plates), but is the desirable, that which arouses Desire, that is, that which
is approachable by a thought that at each instant thinks more than it
thinks. The infinite is not thereby an immense object, exceeding the
horizons of the look. It is Desire that measures the infinity of the infinite,
for it is a measure through the very impossibility of measure. The in-
ordinateness [ demesure] measured by Desire is the face. Thus we again
meet with the distinction between Desire and need: desire is an aspiration
that the Desirable animates; it originates from its "object"; it is revela-
tion-whereas need is a void of the Soul; it proceeds from the subject.
Truth is sought in the other, but by him who lacks nothing. The
distance is untraversable, and at the same time traversed. The separated
being is satisfied, autonomous, and nonetheless searches after the other
with a search that is not incited by the lack proper to need nor by the
memory of a lost good. Such a situation is language. Truth arises
where a being separated from the other is not engulfed in him, but speaks
to him. Language, which does not touch the other, even tangentially,
reaches the other by calling upon him or by commanding him or by
obeying him, with all the straightforwardness• of these relations.
Separation and interiority, truth and language constitute the categories
of the idea of infinity or metaphysics.
In separation-which is produced in the psychism of enjoyment, in
egoism, in happiness, where the I identifies itself-the I is ignorant
of the Other. But the Desire for the other, above happiness, requires
this happiness, this autonomy of the sensible in the world, even though
this separation is deducible neither analytically nor dialectically from
the other. The I endowed with personal life, the atheist I whose atheism
is without wants and is integrated in no destiny, surpasses itself in the
Desire that comes to it from the presence of the other. This Desire
is a desire in a being already happy: desire is the misfortune of the fiappy,
a luxurious need.
Already the I exists in an eminent sense: for one cannot imagine it as

• "Droiture": we are translating this term sometimes by "straightforward-
ness," sometimes by "uprightness."-Trans.
B. Separation and Discourse                        63
first existing and in addition endowed with happiness as an attribute
added to this existence. The I exists as separated in its enjoyment, that
is, as happy; and it can sacrifice its pure and simple being to happiness.
It exists in an eminent sense; it exists above being. But in Desire the
being of the I appears still higher, since it can sacrifice to its Desire its
very happiness. It thus finds itself above, or at the apex, at the apogee of
being by enjoying (happiness} and by desiring (truth and justice}.
Above being. Desire marks a sort of inversion with regard to the
classical notion of substance. In it being becomes goodness: at the
apogee of its being, expanded into happiness, in egoism, positing itself as
ego, here it is, beating its own record, preoccupied with another being!
This represents a fundamental inversion not of some one of the functions
of being, a function turned from its goal, but an inversion of its very
exercise of being, which suspends its spontaneous movement of existing
and gives another direction to its unsurpassable apology.
Insatiable Desire-not because it corresponds to an infinite hunger, but
because it is not an appeal for food. This Desire is insatiable, but
not because of our finitude. Might the Platonic myth of love as offspring
of abundance and poverty be interpreted as the indigence of wealth
itself, as the desire not of what one has lost, but absolute Desire,
produced in a being in possession of itself and consequently already
absolutely "on its own feet"? Has not Plato, rejecting the myth of the
androgynous being presented by Aristophanes, caught sight of the non-
nostalgic character of Desire and of philosophy, implying autochthonous
existence and not exile-desire as erosion of the absoluteness of being by
the presence of the Desirable, which is consequently a revealed presence,
opening Desire in a being that in separation experiences itself as autono-
mous?
But love as analyzed by Plato does not coincide with what we have
called Desire. Immortality is not the objective of the first movement of
Desire, but the other, the Stranger. It is absolutely non-egoist; its name
is justice. It does not link up beings already akin. The great force of
the idea of creation such as it was contributed by monotheism is that
this creation is ex nihilo-not because this represents a work more
miraculous than the demiurgic informing of matter, but because the
separated and created being is thereby not simply issued forth from the
father, but is absolutely other than him. Filiality itself can not appear as
essential to the destiny of the I unless man retains this memory
of the creation ex nihilo, without which the son is not a true other.
64                         Totality and Infinity
Finally, the distance that separates happiness from desire separates
politics from religion. Politics tends toward reciprocal recognition, that
is, toward equality; it ensures happiness. And political law concludes
and sanctions the struggle for recognition. Religion is Desire and not
struggle for recognition. It is the surplus possible in a society of equals,
that of glorious humility, responsibility, and sacrifice, which are the
condition for equality itself.


3. Discourse
In affirming truth to be a modality of the relation between the same
and the other we do not oppose intellectualism, but rather ensure its
fundamental aspiration, the respect for being illuminating the intellect.
The originality of separation has appeared to us to consist in the
autonomy of the separated being. Whence in knowledge, or more
exactly in the claim to it, the knower neither participates in nor unites
with the known being. The relation of truth thus involves a dimension
of interiority, a psychism, in which the metaphysician, while being in
relation with the Metaphysical, maintains himself apart. But we have
also indicated that this relation of truth, which at the same time spans
and does not span the distance-does not form a totality with the "other
shore"-rests on language: a relation in which the terms absolve them-
selves from the relation, remain absolute within the relation. Without
this absolution the absolute distance of metaphysics would be illusory.
The knowledge of objects does not secure a relation whose terms
would absolve themselves from the relation. Though objective knowl-
edge remain disinterested, it is nevertheless marked by the way the
knowing being has approached the Real. To recognize truth to be disclo-
sure is to refer it to the horizon of him who discloses. Plato, who
identifies knowledge with vision, stresses, in the myth of the chariot of
the Phaedrus, the movement of the soul that contemplates truth and the
relativeness of truth to that course. The disclosed being is relative to
us and not rn8'avrb. According to the classical terminology, sensibility-
a pretension to pure experience, a receptivity of being-becomes knowl-
edge only after having been modeled by the understanding. According
to the modern terminology, we disclose only with respect to a project.
In labor we approach the Real with a view to a goal conceived by us.
This modification that knowledge brings to bear on the One, which in
cognition loses its unity, is evoked by Plato in the Parmenides. Knowl-
B. Separation and Discourse                     6S
edge in the absolute sense of the term, the pure experience of the other
being, would have to maintain the other being ,m8'abrb.
If the object thus refers to the project and labor of the knower, it is
because objective cognition is a relation with the being that one always
goes beyond and that always is to be interpreted. The "what is it?"
approaches "this" qua "that." For to know objectively is to know the
historical, the fact, the already happened, the already passed by.• The
historical is not defined by the past; both the historical and the past are
defined as themes of which one can speak. They are thematized precisely
because they no longer speak. The historical is forever absent from its
very presence. This means that it disappears behind its manifesta-
tions; its apparition is always superficial and equivocal; its origin, its
principle, always elsewhere. It is a phenomenon-a reality without
reality. The flow of time in which, according to the Kantian schema,
the world is constituted is without origin. This world that has lost its
principle, an-archical, a world of phenomena, does not answer to the
quest for the true; it suffices for enjoyment, which is self-sufficiency
itself, nowise disturbed by the evasion that exteriority opposes to the
quest for the true. This world of enjoyment does not suffice for the
metaphysical claim. The knowledge of the thematized is only a recom-
mencing struggle against the always possible mystification of facts-at
the same time an idolatry of facts, that is, an invocation of what does
not speak, and an insurmountable plurality of significations and mystifi-
cations. Or else this knowledge invites the knower to an interminable
psychoanalysis, to the desperate search for a true origin at least in one-
self, to the effort to awaken.
The manifestation of the ,ca8'avro in which a being concerns us with-
out slipping away and without betraying itself does not consist in its being
disclosed, its being exposed to the gaze that would take it as a theme for
interpretation, and would command an absolute position dominating the
object. Manifestation ,ca(}'avro consists in a being telling itself to us
independently of every position we would have taken in its regard,
expressing itself. Here, contrary to all the conditions for the visibility of
objects, a being is not placed in the light of another but presents itself
in the manifestation that should only announce it; it is present as
directing this very manifestation-present before the manifestation,
which only manifests it. The absolute experience is not disclosure but

• " .•• le Iait, le dlji fait, le dejA depaaae."
66                          Totality and Infinity
revelation: a coinciding of the expressed with him who expresses, which
is the privileged manifestation of the Other, the manifestation of a face
over and beyond form. Form-incessantly betraying its own manifesta-
tion, congealing into a plastic form, for it is adequate to the same--
alienates the exteriority of the other. The face is a living presence; it is
expression. The life of expression consists in undoing the form in which
the existent, exposed as a theme, is thereby dissimulated. The face
speaks. The manifestation of the face is already discourse. He who
manifests himself comes, according to Plato's expression, to his own
assistance. He at each instant undoes the form he presents.
This way of undoing the form adequate to the Same so as to present
oneself as other is to signify or to have a meaning. To present oneself by
signifying is to speak. This presence, affirmed in the presence of the
image as the focus of the gaze that is fixed on you, is said. Signification
or expression thus contrasts with every intuitive datum precisely because
to signify is not to give. Signification is not an ideal essence or a relation
open to intellectual intuition, thus still analogous to the sensation
presented to the eye. It is preeminently the presence of exteriority.
Discourse is not simply a modification of intuition ( or of thought), but
an original relation with exterior being. It is not a regretable defect of
a being deprived of intellectual intuition-as though intuition, which is a
solitary thought, were the model for all straightforwardness in relations.
It is the production of meaning. Meaning is not produced as an ideal
essence; it is said and taught by presence, and teaching is not reducible to
sensible or intellectual intuition, which is the thought of the same. To
give meaning to one's presence is an event irreducible to evidence. It
does not enter into an intuition; it is a presence more direct than visible
manifestation, and at the same time a remote presence--that of the other.
This presence dominates him who welcomes it, comes from the heights,
unforeseen, and consequently teaches its very novelty. It is the frank
presence of an existent that can lie, that is, disposes of the theme he
offers, without being able to dissimulate his frankness as interlocutor,
always struggling openly [a visage decouvert]. The eyes break through
the mask-the language of the eyes, impossible to dissemble. The eye
does not shine; it speaks. The alternative of truth and lying, of sincerity
and dissimulation, is the prerogative of him who abides in the relation of
absolute frankness, in the absolute frankness which cannot hide itself.
Action does not express. It has meaning, but leads us to the agent in
his absence. To approach someone from works is to enter into his
B. Separation and Discourse                      67
interiority as though by burglary; the other is surprised in his intimacy,
where, like the personages of history, he is, to be sure, exposed, but does
not express himself.7 Works signify their author, but indirectly, in the
third person.
One can, to be sure, conceive of language as an act, as a gesture of
behavior. But then one omits the essential of language: the coinciding of
the revealer and the revealed in the face, which is accomplished in being
situated in height with respect to us-in teaching. And, conversely,
gestures and acts produced can become, like words, a revelation, that is, as
we will see, a teaching. But the reconstitution of the personage on
the basis of his behavior is the work of our already acquired science.
Absolute experience is not disclosure; to disclose, on the basis of
a subjective horizon, is already to miss the noumenon. The interlocutor
alone is the term of pure experience, where the Other enters into
relation while remaining Ka8'avr6, where he expresses himself without
our having to disclose him from a "point of view," in a borrowed light.
The "objectivity" sought by the knowledge that is fully knowledge is
realized beyond the objectivity of the object. What presents itself as
independent of every subjective movement is the interlocutor, whose way
consists in starting from himself, foreign and yet presenting himself to me.
But the relationship with this "thing in itself" does not lie at the limit
of a cognition that begins as a constitution of a "living body," as accord-
ing to Husserl's celebrated analysis in the fifth of his Cartesian M edita-
tions. The constitution of the Other's body in what Husserl calls
"the primordial sphere," the transcendental "coupling" of the object thus
constituted with my own body itself experienced from within as an "I
can," the comprehension of this body of the Other as an alter ego-this
analysis dissimulates, in each of its stages which are taken as a description
of constitution, mutations of object constitution into a relation with the
Other-which is as primordial as the constitution from which it is to be
derived. The primordial sphere, which corresponds to what we call
the same, turns to the absolutely other only on call from the Other.
Revelation constitutes a veritable inversion objectifying cognition. In
Heidegger coexistence is, to be sure, taken as a relationship with the
Other irreducible to objective cognition; but in the final analysis it also
rests on the relationship with being in general, on comprehension, on
ontology. Heidegger posits in advance this ground of being as the

1 See below   [pp. 177-178, 226-232.-Trans.].
68                         Totality and Infinity
horizon on which every existent arises, as though the horizon, and the
idea of limit it includes and which is proper to vision, were the ultimate
structure of relationship. Moreover, for Heidegger intersubjectivity
is a coexistence, a we prior to the I and the other, a neutral intersubjectiv-
ity. The face to face both announces a society, and permits the maintain-
ing of a separated I.
Durkheim already in one respect went beyond this optical interpreta-
tion of the relation with the other in characterizing society by religion. I
relate to the Other only across Society, which is not simply a multiplicity
of individuals or objects; I relate to the Other who is not simply a part
of a Whole, nor a singular instance of a concept. To reach the Other
through the social is to reach him through the religious. Durkheim thus
gives an indication of a transcendence other than that of the objective.
And yet for him the religious is immediately reducible to collective
representation: the structure of representation, and consequently of the
objectifying intentionality that subtends it, serves as an ultimate interpre-
tation of the religious itself.
Because of a current of ideas appearing independently in Gabriel
Marcel's Metaphysical Journal and Martin Buber's I and Thou, the
relationship with the Other as irreducible to objective knowledge has lost
its unwonted character, whatever be the attitude one adopts with regard
to the accompanying systematic expositions. Buber distinguished the
relation with Objects, which would be guided by the practical, from the
dialogic relation, which reaches the other as Thou, as partner and friend.
This idea, central in his work, he modestly claims to have found in
Feuerbach.8 In reality it acquires all its force only in Buber's analyses,
and it is in them that it figures as an essential contribution to contempo-
rary thought. One may, however, ask if the thou-saying [tutoiement]
does not place the other in a reciprocal relation, and if this reciprocity is
primordial. On the other hand, the I-Thou relation in Buber retains a
formal character: it can unite man to things as much as man to man.
The I-Thou formalism does not determine any concrete structure. The
I-Thou is an event (Geschehen), a shock, a comprehension, but does not

8 Cf. M. Buber, "Das Problem des Menschen," Dialogisches Leben, p. 366.

Concerning the influences upon Buber, cf. Maurice S. Friedman, "Martin Bu-
ber's Theory of Knowledge," The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. VIII, n. 2 (De-
cember, 19S4), p. 264, note.
B. Separation and Discourse                        69
enable us to account for ( except as an aberration, a fall, or a sickness) a
life other than friendship: economy, the search for happiness, the repre-
sentational relation with things. They remain, in a sort of disdainful
spiritualism, unexplored and unexplained. This work does not have the
ridiculous pretension of "correcting" Buber on these points. It is placed
in a different perspective, by starting with the idea of the Infinite.
The claim to know and to reach the other is realized in the relation-
ship with the Other that is cast in the relation of language, where the
essential is the interpellation, the vocative. The other is maintained and
confirmed in his heterogeneity as soon as one calls upon him, be it only to
say to him that one cannot speak to him, to classify him as sick, to
announce to him his death sentence; at the same time as grasped,
wounded, outraged, he is "respected." The invoked is not what I
comprehend: he is not under a category. He is the one to whom I speak
-he has only a reference to himself; he has no quiddity. But the formal
structure of interpellation has to be worked out.
The object of knowledge is always a fact, already happened and passed
through. The interpellated one is called upon to speak; his speech
consists in "coming to the assistance" of his word-in being present.
This present is not made of instants mysteriously immobilized in dura-
tion, but of an incessant recapture of instants that flow by by a presence
that comes to their assistance, that answers for them. This incessance
produces the present, is the presentation, the life, of the present. It is as
though the presence of him who speaks inverted the inevitable movement
tha~ bears the spoken word to the past state of the written word.
Expression is this actualization of the actual. The present is produced in
this struggle against the past ( if one may so speak), in this actualization.
The unique actuality of speech tears it from the situation in which it
appears and which it seems to prolong. It brings what the written word
is already deprived of: mastery. Speech, better than a simple sign, is es-
sentially magisterial. It first of all teaches this teaching itself, by virtue
of which alone it can teach ( and not, like maieutics, awaken in me)
things and ideas. Ideas instruct me coming from the master who Pre-
sents them to me: who puts them in question; the objectification and
theme upon which objective knowledge opens already rest on teaching.
The calling into question of things in a dialectic is not a modifying of
the perception of them ; it coincides with their objectification. The ob-
ject is presented when we have welcomed an interlocutor. The master,
70                        Totality and Infinity
the coinciding of the teaching and the teacher, is not in turn a fact
among others. The present of the manifestation of the master who
teaches overcomes the anarchy of facts.
We must not say that language conditions consciousness, under the pre-
text that it provides self-consciousness with an incarnation in the objec-
tive work language would be ( as the Hegelians would say). The
exteriority that language, the relation with the Other, delineates is
unlike the exteriority of a work, for the objective exteriority of works
is already situated in the world established by language-by transcen-
dence.


4. Rhetoric and Injustice
Not every discourse is a relation with exteriority.
It is not the interlocutor our master whom we most often approach in
our conversations, but an object or an infant, or a man of the multitude,
as Plato says. 9 Our pedagogical or psychagogical discourse is rhetoric,
taking the position of him who approaches his neighbor with ruse. And
this is why the art of the sophist is a theme with reference to which the
true conversation concerning truth, or philosophical discourse, is defined.
Rhetoric, absent from no discourse, and which philosophical discourse
seeks to overcome, resists discourse ( or leads to it: pedagogy, demagogy,
psychagogy). It approaches the other not to face him, but obliquely-
not, to be sure, as a thing, since rhetoric remains conversation, and
across all its artifices goes unto the Other, solicits his yes. But the
specific nature of rhetoric ( of propaganda, flattery, diplomacy, etc.)
consists in corrupting this freedom. It is for this that it is preeminently
violence, that is, injustice-not violence exercised on an inertia ( which
would not be a violence), but on a freedom, which, precisely as free-
dom, should be incorruptible. To freedom it manages to apply a
category; it seems to judge of it as of a nature; it asks the question,
contradictory in its terms, "what is the nature of this freedom?"
To renounce the psychagogy, demagogy, pedagogy rhetoric involves
is to face the Other, in a veritable conversation. Then this being is
nowise an object, is outside of all emprise. This disengagement from all
objectivity means, positively, this being's presentation in the face, his

11 Phaedrus, 273d.
B. Separation and Discourse                       71
expression, his language. The other qua other is the Other.• To "let
him be" the relationship of discourse is required; pure "disclosure,"
where he is proposed as a theme, does not respect him enough for that.
We call justice this face to face approach, in conversation. If truth arises
in the absolute experience in which being gleams with its own light, then
truth is produced only in veritable conversation or in justice.
This absolute experience in the face to face, in which the interlocutor
presents himself as absolute being ( that is, as being withdrawn from
the categories), would for Plato be inconceivable without the inter-
position of the Ideas. The impersonal relation and discourse seem to
refer to solitary discourse, or reason, to the soul conversing with itself.
But is the Platonic idea attended to by the thinker equivalent to a
sublimated and perfected object'f Is the kinship between the Soul and
the Ideas, emphasized in the Phaedo, but an idealist metaphor expressing
the permeability of being to thought? Is the ideality of the ideal
reducible to a superlative extension of qualities, or does it lead us to a
region where beings have a face, that is, are present in their own
message? Herman Cohen (in this a Platonist) maintained that one
can love only ideas; but the notion of an Idea is in the last analysis
tantamount to the transmutation of the other into the Other. For Plato
true discourse can come to its own assistance: the content that is pre-
sented to me is inseparable from him who has thought it-which means
that the author of the discourse responds to questions. Thought, for
Plato, is not reducible to an impersonal concatenation of true relations,
but implies persons and interpersonal relations. Socrates' daemon inter-
venes in the maieutic art itself, which, however, refers to what is common
to men.1° Community through the interposition of the ideas does not
establish pure and simple equality among the interlocutors. The philoso-
pher who, in the Phaedo, is compared with the caretaker assigned to his
post, is under the magistrature of the gods; he is not their equal. Can
the hierarchy of beings, at whose summit is found rational being, be
transcended? To what new purity does the elevation of a god corre-
spond? To the words and actions that are addressed to me, and which
are always still to a certain extent rhetoric and negociation ( "where we
deal with them"), words addressed to men who are the multitude,11
Plato opposes the utterances with which we please the gods. The
• "L'Autre en tant qu'autre est Autrui."

interlocutors are not equals; when it has reached truth discourse is
conversation with a god who is not our "fellow-servant."12 Society does
not proceed from the contemplation of the true; truth is made possible
by relation with the Other our master. Truth is thus bound up with
the social relation, which is justice. Justice consists in recognizing in
the Other my master. Equality among persons means nothing of itself;
it has an economic meaning and presupposes money, and already rests
on justice--which, when well-ordered, begins with the Other. Justice is
the recognition of his privilege qua Other and his mastery, is access
to the Other outside of rhetoric, which is ruse, emprise, and exploitation.
And in this sense justice coincides with the overcoming of rhetoric.


5. Discourse and Ethics
Can objectivity and the universality of thought be founded on dis-
course? Is not universal thought of itself prior to discourse? Does not
a mind in speaking evoke what the other mind already thinks, both of
them participating in common ideas? But the community of thought
ought to have made language as a relation between beings impossible.
Coherent discourse is one. A universal thought dispenses with communi-
cation. A reason cannot be other for a reason. How can a reason be an
I or an other, since its very being consists in renouncing singularity?
European thought has always combated, as skeptical, the idea of man
as measure of all things, although this idea contributes the idea of
atheist separation and one of the foundations of discourse. For it the
sentient I could not found Reason; the I was defined by reason. Reason
speaking in the first person is not addressed to the other, conducts a
monologue. And, conversely, it would attain to veritable personality,
would recover the sovereignty characteristic of the autonomous person,
only by becoming universal. Separated thinkers become rational only in
the measure that their personal and particular acts of thinking figure as
moments of this unique and universal discourse. There would be reason
in the thinking individual only in the measure that he would himself
enter into his own discourse, that thought would, in the etymological
sense of the term, comprehend the thinker-that it would include him.
But to make of the thinker a moment of thought is to limit the
revealing function of language to its coherence, conveying the coher-

12 Ibid.
B. Separation and Discourse                      73
ence of concepts. In this coherence the unique I of the thinker volatil-
izes. The function of language would amount to suppressing "the
other," who breaks this coherence and is hence essentially irrational. A
curious result: language would consist in suppressing the other, in mak-
ing the other agree with the same! But in its expressive function
language precisely maintains the other-to whom it is addl"ess~d, ~horn
it calls upon or invokes. To be sure, language does not consist in
invoking him as a being represented and thought. But this is why
language institutes a relation irreducible to the subject-object relation:
the revelation of the other. In this revelation only can language as a
system of signs be constituted. The other called upon is not something
represented, is not a given, is not a particular, through one side already
open to generalization. Language, far from presupposing universality
and generality, first makes them possible. Language presupposes inter-
locutors, a plurality. Their commerce is not a representation of the
one by the other, nor a participation in universality, on the common plane
of language. Their commerce, as we shall show shortly, is ethical.
Plato maintains the difference between the objective order of truth,
that which doubtlessly is established in writings, impersonally, and rea-
son in a living being, "a living and animated discourse," a discourse
"which can defend itself, and knows when to speak and when to be
silent. 1113 This discourse is therefore not the unfolding of a prefabri-
cated internal logic, but the constitution of truth in a struggle between
thinkers, with all the risks of freedom. The relationship of language
implies transcendence, radical separation, the strangeness of the interloc-
utors, the revelation of the other to me. In other words, language is
spoken where community between the terms of the relationship is wanting,
where the common plane is wanting or is yet to be constituted. It takes
place in this transcendence. Discourse is thus the experience of some-
thing absolutely foreign, a pure "knowledge" or "experience," a trauma-
tism of astonishment.
The absolutely foreign alone can instruct us. And it is only man who
could be absolutely foreign to me-refractory to every typology, to every
genus, to every characterology, to every classification-and conse-
quently the term of a "knowledge" finally penetrating beyond the object.
The strangeness of the Other, his very freedom! Free beings alone can
be strangers to one another. Their freedom which is "common" to them

11 Phaedrus, 276a.
74                           Totality and ln/itdty
is precisely what separates them. As a "pure knowledge" language con-
sists in the relationship with a being that in a certain sense is not by rela-
tion to me, or, if one likes, that is in a relationship with me only inasmuch
as he is wholly by relation to himself,• KaO'avTo, a being that stands
beyond every attribute, which would precisely have as its effect to qualify
him, that is, to reduce him to what is common to him and other beings-
a being, consequently, completely naked.
The things are naked, by metaphor, only when they are without
adornments: bare walls, naked landscapes. They have no need of adorn-
ment when they are absorbed in the accomplishment of the function for
which they are made: when they are subordinated to their own finality so
radically that they disappear in it. They disappear beneath their form.
The perception of individual things is the fact that they are not entirely
absorbed in their form; they then stand out in themselves, breaking
through, rending their forms, are not resolved into the relations that link
them up to the totality. They are always in some respect like those
industrial cities where everything is adapted to a goal of production, but
which, full of smoke, full of wastes and sadness, exist also for themselves.
For a thing nudity is the surplus of its being over its finality. It is its
absurdity, its uselessness, which itself appears only relative to the form
against which it contrasts and of which it is deficient. The thing is
always an opacity, a resistance, a ugliness. Thus the Platonic conception
of the intelligible sun situated outside of the eye that sees and the object
it illuminates describes with precision the perception of things. Objects
have no light of their own ; they receive a borrowed light.
Beauty then introduces a new finality, an internal finality, into this
naked world. To disclose by science and by art is essentially to clothe
the elements with signification, to go beyond perception. To disclose a
thing is to clarify it by forms: to find for it a place in the whole by
apperceiving its function or its beauty.
The work of language is entirely different: it consists in entering into
relationship with a nudity disengaged from every form, but having
meaning by itself, KafJ'avT6, signifying before we have projected light
upon it, appearing not as a privation on the ground of an ambivalence of
values ( as good or evil, as beauty or ugliness), but as an always positive
value. Such a nudity is the face. The nakedness of the face is not
• " •.. consist dans le rapport avec un etre qui dans un certain sens, n'est pas
par rapport a moi; ou, si l'on veut, qui n'est en rapport avec moi que dans la
mesure ou il est enti!rement par rapport a soi, •••"
B. Separation and Discourse                         75
what is presented to me because I disclose it, what would therefore be
presented to me, to my powers, to my eyes, to my perceptions, in a light
exterior to it. The face has turned to me-and this is its very nudity.
It is by itself and not by reference to a system.
To be sure nakedness can have still a third meaning, outside of the
absurdity of the thing losing its system or the signification of the face
breaking through all form: the nudity of the body felt in modesty,
appearing to the Other in repulsion and desire. But this nudity always
refers in one way or other to the nakedness of the face. Only a being
absolutely naked by his face can also denude himself immodestly.
But the difference between the nakedness of the face that turns to me
and the disclosure of the thing illuminated by its form does not simply
separate two modes of "knowledge." The relation with the face is not
an object-cognition. The transcendence of the face is at the same time its
absence from this world into which it enters, the exiling [depaysement]
of a being, his condition of being stranger, destitute, or proletarian. The
strangeness that is freedom is also strangeness-destitution [etrangete-
misere]. Freedom presents itself as the other to the same, who is always
the autochthon of being, always privileged in his own residence. The
other, the free one, is also the stranger. The nakedness of his face
extends into the nakedness of the body that is cold and that is ashamed of
its nakedness. Existence Ka0'afJr6 is, in the world, a destitution. There
is here a relation between me and the other beyond rhetoric.
This gaze that supplicates and demands, that can supplicate only
because it demands, deprived of everything because entitled to every-
thing, and which one recognizes in giving ( as one "puts the things in
question in giving" )-this gaze is precisely the epiphany of the face as a
face. The nakedness of the face is destituteness.• To recognize the
Other is to recognize a hunger. To recognize the Other is to give.
But it is to give to the master, to the lord, to him whom one approaches
as "You"** in a dimension of height.
It is in generosity that the world possessed by me-the world open to
enjoyment-is apperceived from a point of view independent of the
egoist position. The "objective" is not simply the object of an impassive
contemplation. Or rather impassive contemplation is defined by gift, by
the abolition of inalienable property. The presence of the Other is
• "La nudit«S du visage est d«Snument."
•• "Vous"-the "you" of majesty, in contrast with the "thou" of intimacy (cf.
pp. 87-88).-Trana.
76                          Totality and Infinity
equivalent to this calling into question of my joyous possession of
the world. The conceptualization of the sensible arises already from
this incision in the living flesh of my own substance, my home, in
this suitability of the mine for the Other, which prepares the descent
of the things to the rank of possible merchandise. This initial dispos-
session conditions the subsequent generalization by money. Conceptu-
alization is the first generalization and the condition for objectivity.
Objectivity coincides with the abolition of inalienable property-which
presupposes the epiphany of the other. The whole problem of generali-
zation is thus posed as a problem of objectivity. The problem of the
general and abstract idea cannot presuppose objectivity as constituted: the
general object is not a sensible object that would, however, be thought in
an intention of generality and ideality. For the nominalist critique of
the general and abstract idea is not yet overcome thereby; it is still neces-
sary to say what this intention of ideality and generality signifies. The
passage from perception to the concept belongs to the constitution of the
objectivity of the perceived object. We must not speak of an intention
of ideality investing perception, an intention in which the solitary being
of the subject, identifying itself in the same, directs itself toward the
transcendent world of the ideas. The generality of the Object is correla-
tive with the generosity of the subject going to the Other, beyond the
egoist and solitary enjoyment, and hence making the community of the
goods of this world break forth from the exclusive property of enjoy-
ment.
To recognize the Other is therefore to come to him across the world of
possessed things, but at the same time to establish, by gift, community
and universality. Language is universal because it is the very passage
from the individual to the general, because it offers things which are
mine to the Other. To speak is to make the world common, to create
commonplaces. Language does not refer to the generality of concepts,
but lays the foundations for a possession in common. It abolishes the
inalienable property of enjoyment. The world in discourse is no longer
what it is in separation, in the being at home with oneself where
everything is given to me; it is what I give: the communicable, the
thought, the universal.
Thus conversation is not a pathetic confrontation of two beings absent-
ing themselves from the things and from the others. Discourse is not
love. The transcendence of the Other, which is his eminence, his height,
his lordship, in its concrete meaning includes his destitution, his exile
B. Separation and Discourse                        77
[depaysement], and his rights as a stranger. I can recognize the gaze of
the stranger, the widow, and the orphan only in giving or in refusing; I
am free to give or to refuse, but my recognition passes necessarily
through the interposition of things. Things are not, as in Heidegger, the
foundation of the site, the quintessence of all the relations that constitute
our presence on the earth ( and "under the heavens, in company with
men, and in the expectation of the gods"). The relationship between
the same and the other, my welcoming of the other, is the ultimate fact,
and in it the things figure not as what one builds but as what one gives.


6. The Metaphysical and the Human
To relate to the absolute as an atheist is to welcome the absolute
purified of the violence of the sacred. In the dimension of height in
which his sanctity, that is, his separation, is presented, the infinite does
not burn the eyes that are lifted unto him. He speaks; he does not have
the mythical format that is impossible to confront and would hold the I
in its invisible meshes. He is not numinous: the I who approaches him is
neither annihilated on contact nor transported outside of itself, but
remains separated and keeps its as-for-me. Only an atheist being can
relate himself to the other and already absolve himself from this relation.
Transcendence is to be distinguished from a union with the transcendent
by participation. The metaphysical relation, the idea of infinity, con-
nects with the noumenon which is not a numen. This noumenon is to be
distinguished from the concept of God possessed by the believers of
positive religions ill disengaged from the bonds of participation, who
accept being immersed in a myth unbeknown to themselves. The idea of
infinity, the metaphysical relation, is the dawn of a humanity with-
out myths. But faith purged of myths, the monotheist faith, itself
implies metaphysical atheism. Revelation is discourse; in order to
welcome revelation a being apt for this role of interlocutor, a separated
being, is required. Atheism conditions a veritable relationship with a
true God Ka.8'avrb. But this relationship is as distinct from objectifica-
tion as from participation. To hear the divine word does not amount to
knowing an object; it is to be in relation with a substance overflowing its
own idea in me, overflowing what Descartes calls its "objective exist-
ence." When simply known, thematized, the substance no longer is "ac-
cording to itself." Discourse, in which it is at the same time foreign and
present, suspends participation and, beyond object-cognition, insti-
78                         Totality and Infinity
tutes the pure experience of the social relation, where a being does not
draw its existence from its contact with the other.
To posit the transcendent as stranger and poor one is to prohibit the
metaphysical relation with God from being accomplished in the igno-
rance of men and things. The dimension of the divine opens forth from
the human face. A relation with the Transcendent free from all capti-
vation by the Transcendent is a social relation. It is here that
the Transcendent, infinitely other, solicits us and appeals to us. The
proximity of the Other, the proximity of the neighbor, is in being an
ineluctable moment of the revelation of an absolute presence ( that is,
disengaged from every relation), which expresses itself. His very epiph-
any consists in soliciting us by his destitution in the face of the Stranger,
the widow, and the orphan. The atheism of the metaphysician means,
positively, that our relation with the Metaphysical is an ethical behavior
and not theology, not a thematization, be it a knowledge by analogy, of
the attributes of God. God rises to his supreme and ultimate presence as
correlative to the justice rendered unto men. The direct compreh~nsion
of God is impossible for a look directed upon him, not because our intel-
ligence is limited, but because the relation with infinity respects the total
Transcendence of the other without being bewitched by it, and because
our possibility of welcoming him in man goes further than the com-
prehension that thematizes and encompasses its object. It goes further,
for precisely it thus goes into Infinity. The comprehension of God
taken as a participation in his sacred life, an allegedly direct com-
prehension, is impossible, because participation is a denial of the divine,
and because nothing is more direct than the face to face, which is
straightforwardness itself. A God invisible means not only a God
unimaginable, but a God accessible in justice. Ethics is the spiritual
optics. The subject-object relation does not reflect it; in the impersonal
relation that leads to it the invisible but personal God is not approached
outside of all human presence. The ideal is not only a being superla-
tively being, a sublimation of the objective, or, in the solitude of love, a
sublimation of a Thou. The work of justice-the uprightness of the
face to face--is necessary in order that the breach that leads to God be
produced-and "vision" here coincides with this work of justice. Hence
metaphysics is enacted where the social relation is enacted-in our
relations with men. There can be no "knowledge" of God separated
from the relationship with men. The Other is the very locus of meta-
physical truth, and is indispensable for my relation with God. He does
B. Separation and Discourse                       79
not play the role of a mediator. The Other is not the incarnation of
God, but precisely by his face, in which he is disincarnate, is the manifes-
tation of the height in which God is revealed. It is our relations with
men, which describe a field of research hardly glimpsed at ( where more
often than not we confine ourselves to a few formal categories whose
content would be but "psychology"), that give to theological concepts the
sole signification they admit of. The establishing of this primacy of the
ethical, that is, of the relationship of man to man-signification, teach-
ing, and justice-a primacy of an irreducible structure upon which all
the other structures rest ( and in particular all those which seem to put
us primordially in contact with an impersonal sublimity, aesthetic or onto-
logical), is one of the objectives of the present work.
Metaphysics is enacted in ethical relations. Without the signification
they draw from ethics theological concepts remain empty and formal
frameworks. The role Kant attributed to sensible experience in the
domain of the understanding belongs in metaphysics to interhuman
relations. It is from moral relationships that every metaphysical affir-
mation takes on a "spiritual" meaning, is purified of everything with
which an imagination captive of things and victim of participation
charges our concepts. The ethical relation is defined, in contrast with
every relation with the sacred, by excluding every signification it would
take on unbeknown to him who maintains that relation. When I
maintain an ethical relation I refuse to recognize the role I would play in
a drama of which I would not be the author or whose outcome another
would know before me; I refuse to figure in a drama of salvation or of
damnation that would be enacted in spite of me and that would make
game of me. This is not equivalent to a diabolical pride, for it does not
exclude obedience. But obedience precisely is to be distinguished from
an involuntary participation in mysterious designs in which one figures or
which one prefigures. Everything that cannot be reduced to an interhu-
man relation represents not the superior form but the forever primitive
form of religion.


7. The Face to Face-An Irreducible Relation
Our analyses are guided by a formal structure: the idea of Infinity
in us. To have the idea of Infinity it is necessary to exist as separated.
This separation cannot be produced as only echoing the transcendence of
Infinity, for then the separation would be maintained within a correla-
80                         Totality and I n/inity
tion that would restore totality and render transcendence illusory. But
the idea of Infinity is transcendence itself, the overflowing of an adequate
idea. If totality can not be constituted it is because Infinity does not
permit itself to be integrated. It is not the insufficiency of the I that
prevents totalization, but the Infinity of the Other.
In metaphysics a being separated from the Infinite nonetheless relates
to it, with a relation that does not nullify the infinite interval of the
separation-which thus differs from every interval. In metaphysics a
being is in a relation with what it cannot absorb, with what it cannot,
in the etymological sense of the term, comprehend. In the concrete the
positive face of the formal structure, having the idea of infinity, is
discourse, specified as an ethical relation. For the relation between the
being here below and the transcendent being that results in no commu-
nity of concept or totality-a relation without relation-we reserve the
term religion.
The negative description of transcendence as the impossibility for the
transcendent being and the being that is separated from it to participate
in the same concept also comes from Descartes. For he affirms that
the term being is applied to God and to creation in an equivocal sense.
Across the theology of the analogous attributes of the Middle Ages this
thesis goes back to the conception of the only analogical unity of being in
Aristotle. In Plato it is found in the transcendence of the Good with
respect to being. It should have served as a foundation for a pluralist
philosophy in which the plurality of being would not disappear into the
unity of number nor be integrated into a totality. Totality and the
embrace of being, or ontology, do not contain the final secret of being.
Religion, where relationship subsists between the same and the other
despite the impossibility of the Whole-the idea of Infinity-is the
ultimate structure.
The same and the other can not enter into a cognition that would
encompass them; the relations that the separated being maintains with
what transcends it are not produced on the ground of totality, do not
crystallize in to a system. Yet do we not name them together? The
formal synthesis of the word that names them together is already part of
a discourse, that is, of a conjuncture of transcendence, breaking the
totality. The conjuncture of the same and the other, in which even their
verbal proximity is maintained, is the direct and full face welcome of the
other by me. This conjuncture is irreducible to totality; the "face to
face" position is not a modification of the "along side of. . . ." Even
B. Separation and Discourse                        81
when I shall have linked the Other to myself with the conjunction "and"
the Other continues to face me, to reveal himself in his face. Religion
subtends this formal totality. And if I set forth, as in a final and
absolute vision, the separation and transcendence which are the themes of
this book, these relations, which I claim form the fabric of being itself,
first come together in my discourse presently addressed to my interlocu-
tors: inevitably across my idea of the Infinite the other faces me-hostile,
friend, my master, my student. Reflection can, to be sure, become aware
of this face to face, but the "unnatural" position of reflection is not an
accident in the life of consciousness. It involves a calling into question
of oneself, a critical attitude which is itself produced in face of the other
and under his authority. We shall show this further. The face to face
remains an ultimate situation.
## C. Truth And Justice


1. Freedom Called into Question
Metaphysics or transcendence is recognized in the work of the intellect
that aspires after exteriority, that is Desire. But the Desire for exterior-
ity has appeared to us to move not in objective cognition but in
Discourse, which in turn has presented itself as justice, in the uprightness
of the welcome made to the face. Is not the vocation to truth to which
traditionally the intellect answers belied by this analysis? What is the
relation between justice and truth?
Truth is in effect not separable from intelligibility; to know is not
simply to record, but always to comprehend. We also say that to know
is to justify, making intervene, by analogy with the moral order, the
notion of justice. The justification of a fact consists in lifting from it
its character of being a fact, accomplished, past, and hence irrevocable,
which as such obstructs our spontaneity. But to say that as an obstacle
to our spontaneity a fact is unjust is to suppose that spontaneity is not
to be put in question, that free exercise is not subject to norms, but is
the norm. And yet the concern for intelligibility is fundamentally
different from an attitude that engenders an action without regard for
obstacles. It signifies on the contrary a certain respect for objects.
For an obstacle to become a fact that requires a theoretical j).lstification
or a reason the spontaneity of the action that surmounts it had to be
inhibited, that is, itself put into question. It is then that we move from
an activity without regard for anything to a consideration of the fact.
The famous suspension of action that is said to make theory possible de-
pends on a reserve of freedom, which does not abandon itself to its drives,
to its impulsive movements, and keeps its distances. Theory, in which
truth arises, is the attitude of a being that distrusts itself. Knowing be-
comes knowing of a fact only if it is at the same time critical, if it puts
itself into question, goes back beyond its origin-in an unnatural move-
82
C. Truth and Justice                            83
ment to seek higher than one's own origin, a movement which evinces or
describes a created freedom.
This self-criticism can be understood as a discovery of one's weakness
or a discovery of one's unworthiness-either as a consciousness of
failure or as a consciousness of guilt. In the latter case to justify
freedom is not to prove it but to render it just.
The predominance of a tradition that subordinates unworthiness to
failure, moral generosity itself to the necessities of objective thought,
is perceivable in European thought. The spontaneity of freedom is
not called in question; its limitation alone is held to be tragic and to con-
stitute a scandal. Freedom is called in question only inasmuch as it some-
how finds itself imposed upon itself: if I could have freely chosen my
own existence everything would be justified. The failure of my spon-
taneity still bereft of reason awakens reason and theory ; there would
have been a suffering that would be the mother of wisdom. From
failure alone would come the necessity of curbing violence and introduc-
ing order into human relations. Political theory derives justice from
the undiscussed value of spontaneity; its problem is to ensure, by way of
knowledge of the world, the most complete exercise of spontaneity by
reconciling my freedom with the freedom of the others.
This position admits not only the undiscussed value of spontaneity but
also the possibility of a rational being being situated within the totality.
The critique of spontaneity engendered by failure, which calls in question
the central place the I occupies in the world, implies then a power to
reflect on its failure and on the totality, an uprooting of the I torn up
from itself and living in the universal. It founds neither theory nor
truth; it presupposes them: it proceeds from knowledge of the world, is
already born from a knowledge, the knowledge of failure. The con-
sciousness of failure is already theoretical.
The critique of spontaneity engendered by the consciousness of moral
unworthiness, on the contrary, precedes truth, precedes the consideration
of the whole, and does not imply the sublimation of the I in the
universal. The consciousness of unworthiness is not in its turn a truth,
is not a consideration of facts. The first consciousness of my immorality
is not my subordination to facts, but to the Other, to the Infinite. The
idea of totality and the idea of infinity duier precisely in that the first is
purely theoretical, while the second is moral. The freedom that can be
ashamed of itself founds truth (and thus truth is not deduced from
84                         Totality and Infinity
truth). The Other is not initially a fact, is not an obstacle, does not
threaten me with death; he is desired in my shame. To discover the
unjustified facticity of power and freedom one must not consider it as an
object, nor consider the Other as an object; one must measure oneself
against infinity, that is, desire him. It is necessary to have the idea of
infinity, the idea of the perfect, as Descartes would say, in order to know
one's own imperfection. The idea of the perfect is not an idea but
desire; it is the welcoming of the Other, the commencement of moral
consciousness, which calls in question my freedom. Thus this way of
measuring oneself against the perfection of infinity is not a theoretical
consideration; it is accomplished as shame, where freedom discovers itself
murderous in its very exercise. It is accomplished in shame where
freedom at the same time is discovered in the consciousness of shame and
is concealed in the shame itself. Shame does not have the structure of
consciousness and clarity. It is oriented in the inverse direction; its
subject is exterior to me. Discourse and Desire, where the Other
presents himself as interlocutor, as him over whom I cannot have power
[je ne peux pas pouvoir], whom I cannot kill, condition this shame,
where, qua I, I am not innocent spontaneity but usurper and murderer.
Contrariwise, a theoretical idea of another myself is not adequate to the
infinite, to the other as other, already for the simple reason that he
provokes my shame and presents himself as dominating me. His justified
existence is the primary fact, the synonym of his very perfection. And if
the other can invest me and invest my freedom, of itself arbitrary, this is
in the last analysis because I myself can feel myself to be the other of the
other. But this comes about only across very complex structures.
Conscience welcomes the Other. It is the revelation of a resistance
to my powers that does not counter them as a greater force, but calls in
question the naive right of my powers, my glorious spontaneity as a liv-
ing being. Morality begins when freedom, instead of being justified by
itself, feels itself to be arbitrary and violent. The search for the intel-
ligible and the manifestation of the critical essence of knowing, the move-
ment of a being back to what precedes its condition, begin together.


2. The Investiture of Freedom, or Critique
Existence is not in reality condemned to freedom, but is invested as
freedom. Freedom is not bare. To philosophize is to trace freedom
back to what lies before it, to disclose the investiture that liberates
C. Truth and Justice                             85
freedom from the arbitrary. Knowledge as a critique, as a tracing back
to what precedes freedom, can arise only in a being that has an origin
prior to its origin-that is created.•
Critique or philosophy is the essence of knowing. But what is proper
to knowing is not its possibility of going unto an object, a movement by
which it is akin to other acts; its prerogative consists in being able to put
itself in question, in penetrating beneath its own condition. It is
not drawn back from the world because it has the world as its object;
it can have the world as its theme, make of it an object, because its exer-
cise consists, as it were, in taking charge of the very condition that sup-
ports it and that supports even this very act of taking charge.
What is the meaning of this taking charge, this penetration beneath
one's condition first dissimulated by the naive movement that conducts
cognition as an act toward its object? What is the meaning of this
calling in question? It cannot be reduced to the repetition with regard
to cognition as a whole of the questions that are raised for the under-
standing of the things aimed at in the naive act of cognition. In that
case to know knowledge would amount to elaborating a psychology,
which has its place among the other sciences that bear upon objects. The
critical question raised in psychology or in theory of knowledge would
amount to asking, for example, from what certain principle cognition is
derived, or what is its cause. Infinite regression would here be indeed
inevitable, and it is to this sterile course that the proceeding back beneath
one's condition, the power to pose the problem of the foundation, would
be reduced. To identify the problem of the foundation with an objective
knowledge of knowledge is to suppose in advance that freedom can be
founded only on itself, for freedom, the determination of the other by the
same, is the very movement of representation and of its evidence. To iden-
tify the problem of foundation with the knowledge of knowledge is to
forget the arbitrariness of freedom, which is precisely what has to be
grounded. The knowing whose essence is critique cannot be reduced
to objective cognition; it leads to the Other. To welcome the Other is
to put in question my freedom.
But the critical essence of knowing also leads us beyond the knowledge
of the cogito, which we may wish to distinguish from objective knowl-
edge. The evidence of the cogito-where knowledge and the known

• "Le savoir comme critique, comme remontEe en dec;a de la libertE--ne peut
1urgir que dans un etre qui a une origine en dec;a de son origine-qui eat crEE."
86                          Totality and Infinity
coincide without knowledge having had to be already in operation, where
knowledge thus involves no commitment prior to its present commitment,
is at each instant at the beginning, is not in situation ( which, moreover,
is what is proper to all evidence, a pure experience of the present without
condition or past)-cannot satisfy the critical exigency, for the com-
mencement of the cogito remains antecedent to it. It does indeed mark
commencement, because it is the awakening of an existence that takes
charge of its own condition. But this awakening comes from the Other.
Before the cogito existence dreams itself, as though it remained foreign to
itself. It is because it suspects that it is dreaming itself that it awakens.
The doubt makes it seek certainty. But this suspicion, this consciousness
of doubt, implies the idea of the Perfect. The knowing of the cogito
thus refers to a relation with the Master-with the idea of infinity or of
the Perfect. The idea of Infinity is neither the immanence of the I
think nor the transcendence of the object. The cogito in Descartes rests
on the other who is God and who has put the idea of infinity in the soul,
who had taught it, and has not, like the Platonic master, simply aroused
the reminiscence of former visions.
As the act unsettling its own condition, knowing comes into play above
all action. And if the tracing back from a condition to what precedes
that condition describes the status of the creature, in which the uncer-
tainty of freedom and its recourse to justification are bound up, if know-
ing is a creature activity, this unsettling of the condition and this
justification come from the Other. The Other alone eludes thematiza-
tion. Thematization cannot serve to found thematization, for it supposes
it to be already founded; it is the exercise of a freedom sure of itself in its
naive spontaneity-whereas the presence of the Other is not equivalent
to his thematization and consequently does not require this naive and self-
sure spontaneity. The welcoming of the Other is ipso facto the con-
sciousness of my own injustice-the shame that freedom feels for itself.
If philosophy consists in knowing critically, that is, in seeking a founda-
tion for its freedom, in justifying it, it begins with conscience, to which
the other is presented as the Other, and where the movement of themat-
ization is inverted. But this inversion does not amount to "knowing
oneself" as a theme attended to by the Other, but rather in submitting
oneself to an exigency, to a morality. The Other measures me with a
gaze incomparable to the gaze by which I discover him. The dimension
of height in which the Other is placed is as it were the primary curvature
of being from which the privilege of the Other results, the gradient
C. Truth and Justice                            87
[denivellement] of transcendence. The Other is metaphysical. The
Other is not transcendent because he would be free as I am; on the
contrary his freedom is a superiority that comes from his very tran-
scendence. What does this inversion of critique consist in? The
subject is "for itself"-it represents itself and knows itself as long as
it is. But in knowing or representing itself it possesses itself, dominates
itself, extends its identity to what of itself comes to refute this identity.
This imperialism of the same is the whole essence of freedom. The "for
itself" as a mode of existence designates an attachment to oneself as
radical as a naive will to live. But if freedom situates me effrontedly
before the non-me in myself and outside of myself, if it consists in
negating or possessing the non-me, before the Other it retreats. The
relationship with the Other does not move (as does cognition) into
enjoyment and possession, into freedom; the Other imposes himself as an
exigency that dominates this freedom, and hence as more primordial than
everything that takes place in me. The Other, whose exceptional pres-
ence is inscribed in the ethical impossibility of killing him in which I
stand, marks the end of powers. If I can no longer have power over him
it is because he overflows absolutely every idea I can have of him.
The I can indeed, to justify itself, enter upon a different course: it can
endeavor to apprehend itself within a totality. This seems to us to be the
justification of freedom aspired after by the philosophy that, from Spi-
noza to Hegel, identifies will and reason, that, contrary to Descartes,
removes from truth its character of being a free work so as to situate it
where the opposition between the I and the non-I disappears, in an
impersonal reason. Freedom is not maintained but reduced to being the
reflection of a universal order which maintains itself and justifies itself
all by itself, like the God of the ontological argument. This privilege of
the universal order, that it sustains itself and justifies itself ( which
situates it beyond the still subjective work of the Cartesian will), consti-
tutes the divine dignity of this order. Knowing would be the way
by which freedom would denounce its own contingency, by which it
would vanish into the totality. In reality this way dissimulates the an-
cient triumph of the same over the other. If freedom thus ceases to main-
tain itself in the arbitrariness of the solitary certitude of evidence, and if
the solitary is united to the impersonal reality of the divine, the I disap-
pears in this sublimation. For the philosophical tradition of the West
every relation between the same and the other, when it is no longer an
affirmation of the supremacy of the same, reduces itself to an impersonal
88                         Totality and Infinity
relation within a universal order. Philosophy itself is identified with the
substitution of ideas for persons, the theme for the interlocutor, the
interiority of the logical relation for the exteriority of interpellation.
Existents are reduced to the neuter state of the idea, Being, the
concept. It was to escape the arbitrariness of freedom, its disappearance
into the Neuter, that we have approached the I as atheist and created-
free, but capable of tracing back beneath its condition-before the Other,
who does not deliver himself in the "thematization" or "conceptual-
ization" of the Other. To wish to escape dissolution into the Neuter, to
posit knowing as a welcoming of the Other, is not a pious attempt to
maintain the spiritualism of a personal God, but is the condition for
language, without which philosophical discourse itself is but an abortive
act, a pretext for an unintermitting psychoanalysis or philology or sociol-
ogy, in which the appearance of a discourse vanishes in the Whole.
Speaking implies a possibility of breaking ofi and beginning.
To posit knowing as the very existing of the creature, as the tracing
back beyond the condition to the other that founds, is to separate oneself
from a whole philosophical tradition that sought the foundation of the
self in the self, outside of heteronomous opinions. We think that exist-
ence for itself is not the ultimate meaning of knowing, but rather the
putting back into question of the self, the turning back to what is prior to
oneself, in the presence of the Other. The presence of the Other, a
privileged heteronomy, does not clash with freedom but invests it. The
shame for oneself, the presence of and desire for the other are not the
negation of knowing: knowing is their very articulation. The essence of
reason consists not in securing for man a foundation and powers, but
in calling him in question and in inviting him to justice.
Metaphysics therefore does not consist in bending over the "for itself"
of the I to seek in it the solid ground for an absolute approach to being.
It is not in the "know thyself" that its ultimate movement is pursued-
not that the "for itself" be limited or be of bad faith, but because by itself
it is only freedom, that is, arbitrary and unjustified, and in this sense
detestable; it is I, egoism. To be sure, the atheism of the I marks the
break with participation and consequently the possibility of seeking a
justification for oneself, that is, a dependence upon an exteriority without
this dependence absorbing the dependent being, held in invisible meshes.
This dependence, consequently, at the same time maintains independence;
such is the face to face relation. In the quest for truth, a work
eminently individual, which always, as Descartes saw, comes back to the
C. Truth and Justice                           89
freedom of the individual, atheism affirms itself as atheism. But its
critical power takes it beneath its freedom. The unity of spontaneous
freedom, working on straight ahead, and critique, where freedom
is capable of being called in question and thus preceding itself, is what is
termed a creature. The marvel of creation does not only consist in being
a creation ex nihilo, but in that it results in a being capable of receiving a
revelation, learning that it is created, and putting itself in question. The
miracle of creation lies in creating a moral being. And this implies
precisely atheism, but at the same time, beyond atheism, shame for the
arbitrariness of the freedom that constitutes it.
We therefore are also radically opposed to Heidegger who subordi-
nates the relation with the Other to ontology ( which, moreover, he
determines as though the relation with the interlocutor and the Master
could be reduced to it) rather than seeing in justice and injustice a
primordial access to the Other beyond all ontology. The existence of
the Other does not concern us in the collectivity by reason of his partici-
pation in the being that is already familiar to us all, nor by reason of his
power and freedom which we should have to subjugate and utilize for
ourselves, nor by virtue of the difference of his attributes which we would
have to surmount in the process of cognition or in a movement of sympa-
thy merging us with him, as though his existence were an embarrassment.
The Other does not affect us as what must be surmounted, enveloped,
dominated, but as other, independent of us: behind every relation we
could sustain with him, an absolute upsurge. It is this way of welcoming
an absolute existent that we discover in justice and injustice, and that
discourse, essentially teaching, effectuates. The term welcome of the
Other expresses a simultaneity of activity and passivity which places the
relation with the other outside of the dichotomies valid for things:
the a priori and the a posteriori, activity and passivity.
But we wish to show also how, starting from knowing identified with
thematization, the truth of this knowing leads back to the relation
with the Other, that is, to justice. For the sense of our whole effort is
to contest the ineradicable conviction of every philosophy that objective
knowledge is the ultimate relation of transcendence, that the Other
(though he be different from the things) must be known objectively,
even if his freedom should deceive this nostalgia for knowledge. The
sense of our whole effort lies in affirming not that the Other forever
escapes knowing, but that there is no meaning in speaking here of
knowledge or ignorance, for justice, the preeminent transcendence and
90                         Totality and Infinity
the condition for knowing, is nowise, as one would like, a noesis correla-
tive of a noema.


3. Truth Presupposes Justice
The spontaneous freedom of the I unconcerned with its justification is
an eventuality inscribed in the essence of the separated being: a being no
longer participating and hence drawing from itself its own existence,
coming forth from a dimension of interiority, a being conformable to the
fate of Gyges who sees those who look at him without seeing him, and
who knows that he is not seen.
But does not Gyges's position involve the impunity of a being alone in
the world, that is, a being for whom the world is a spectacle? And is not
this the very condition for solitary, and hence uncontested and unpun-
ished, freedom, and for certitude?
Is not this silent world, that is, this pure spectacle, accessible to true
knowledge? Who can punish the exercise of the freedom of knowing?
Or, more exactly, how can the spontaneity of the freedom that is mani-
fested in certitude be called in question? Is not truth correlative with a
freedom that is this side of justice, since it is the freedom of a being that
is alone?

a) THE ANARCHY OF THE SPECTACLE: THE EVIL GENIUS

But a world absolutely silent that would not come to us from the
word, be it mendacious, would be an-archic, without principle, without a
beginning. Thought would strike nothing substantial. On first contact
the phenomenon would degrade into appearance and in this sense would
remain in equivocation, under suspicion of an evil genius. The evil
genius does not manifest himself to state his lie; he remains, as possible,
behind things which all seem to manifest themselves for good. The
possibility of their fall to the state of images or veils codetermines their
apparition as a pure spectacle, and betrays the recess that harbors the evil
genius; whence the possibility of universal doubt, which is not a personal
adventure that happened to Descartes. This possibility is constitutive of
apparition as such, whether produced in sensible experience or in mathe-
matical evidence. Husserl, who nonetheless admitted the possibility of
an autopresentation of things, found this equivocation again in the
essential incompletion of that autopresentation, and in the always possi-
C. Truth and Justice                          91
ble break-up of the "synthesis" that sums up the sequence of its
"aspects!'
The equivocation here is not due to the confusion of two notions, two
substances, or two properties. It is not to be counted among the
confusions produced within a world that has already appeared. Nor is it
the confusion of being and nothingness. What appears is not degraded
into a nothing. But the appearance, which is not a nothing, is not a
being either-not even an interior being, for it is nowise in itself. It
proceeds as though from a mocking intention. He to whom the real had
just presented itself, with an appearance that shone forth as the very skin
of being, is being made game of. For already the primordial or the
ultimate abandons the very skin in which it shone in its nudity, as a
covering that announces, dissimulates, imitates, or deforms it. The
doubt that arises from this ever renewed equivocation that constitutes
the very apparition of the phenomenon does not implicate the acuity
of the gaze that might erroneously confuse quite distinct beings in a
world fully univocal, nor does the doubt question the constancy of forms
of this world, which in fact may be borne by an unremitting becoming; it
concerns the sincerity of what appears. It is as though in this silent and
indecisive apparition a lie were perpetrated, as though the danger of error
arose from an imposture, as though the silence were but the modality of
an utterance.
The silent world is a world that comes to us from the Other, be he
an evil genius. Its equivocation is insinuated in a mockery. Thus silence
is not a simple absence of speech; speech lies in the depths of silence
like a laughter perfidiously held back. It is the inverse of language:
the interlocutor has given a sign, but has declined every interpretation;
this is the silence that terrifies. Speech consists in the Other coming
to the assistance of the sign given forth, attending his own mani-
festation in signs, redressing the equivocal by this attendance.
The evil genius' lie is not an utterance opposed to the veridical word;
it is in that interspace between the illusory and the serious in which a
subject who doubts breathes. The evil genius' lie is beyond every lie; in
the ordinary lie the speaker dissimulates himself, to be sure, but in the
dissimulating word does not evade speech, and hence can be refuted.
The inverse of language is like a laughter that seeks to destroy language,
a laughter infinitely reverberated where mystification interlocks in mysti-
fication without ever resting on a real speech, without ever commencing.
The spectacle of the silent world of facts is bewitched: every phenome-
92                          Totality and I n/inity
non masks, mystifies ad infinitum, making actuality impossible. It is the
situation created by those derisive beings communicating across a laby-
rinth of innuendos which Shakespeare and Goethe have appear in their
scenes of sorcerers where speech is antilanguage and where to respond
would be to cover oneself with rid~le.

b)   EXPRESSION IS THE PRINCIPLE

The ambivalence of apparition is surmounted by expression, the pre-
sentation of the Other to me, the primordial event of signification.
To comprehend a signification is not to go from one term of relation-
ship to another, apperceiving relations within the given. To receive the
given is already to receive it as taught-as an expression of the Other.
Not that it would be necessary to mythically presuppose a god who signals
himself by his world: the world becomes our theme, and hence our object,
as proposed to us; it comes from a primordial teaching, in which scientific
work itself is established and which it requires. The world is offered in
the language of the Other; it is borne by propositions. The Other is the
principle of phenomena. The phenomenon is not deduced from him; one
does not rediscover him by tracing back from the sign the thing would be
to the interlocutor giving this sign, in a movement analogous to that
leading from the appearance to things in themselves. For deduction is a
mode of thinking that applies to objects already given. The interlocutor
can not be deduced, for the relationship between him and me is presup-
posed by every proof. It is presupposed by every symbolism, and not
only because it is necessary to agree on that symbolism, establish its
conventions-which, according to Plato in the Cratylus, cannot be laid
down arbitrarily. This relationship is already necessary for a given to
appear as a sign, a sign signaling a speaker, whatever be signified by the
sign and though it be forever undecipherable. And it is necessary that
the given function as a sign for it to be even given. He who signals him-
self by a sign qua signifying that sign is not the signified of the sign-but
delivers the sign and gives it. The given refers to the giver, but this
reference is not causality, as it is not the relation of a sign to its significa-
tion. We shall speak of it at greater length presently.

c) THE "COGITO" AND THE OTHER
The cogito does not provide a commencement to this iteration of
dreaming. In the Cartesian cogito, taken as the first certitude (but
which, for Descartes, already rests on the existence of God) , there is an
C. Truth and Justice                            93
arbitrary halt which is not justified of itself. Doubt with regard to ob-
jects implies the evidence of the exercise of doubt itself. To deny this
exercise would be again to affirm this exercise. In the cogito the thinking
subject which denies its evidences ends up at the evidence of this work of
negation, although in fact at a different level from that at which it had
denied. But it ends up at the affirmation of an evidence that is not
a final or initial affirmation, for it can be cast into doubt in its turn.
The truth of the second negation, then, is affirmed at a still deeper level
-but, once again, one not impervious to negation. This is not purely
and simply a Sisyphean labor, since the distance traversed each time is not
the same; it is a movement of descent toward an ever more profound
abyss which we elsewhere• have called there is, beyond affirmation and
negation. It is by reason of this operation of vertiginous descent unto
the abyss, by reason of this change of level, that the Cartesian cogito is
not a reasoning in the ordinary sense of the term nor an intuition.
Descartes enters into a work of infinite negation, which is indeed the
work of the atheist subject that has broken with participation and that
remains incapable of an affirmation (although, by the sensibility, disposed
for agreeableness**)-enters into a movement unto the abyss, vertigi-
nously sweeping along the subject incapable of stopping itself.
The I in the negativity manifested by doubt breaks with participation,
but does not find in the cogito itself a stopping place. It is not I, it is the
other that can say yes. From him comes affirmation; he is at the
commencement of experience. Descartes seeks a certitude, and stops at
the first change of level in this vertiginous descent; in fact he possesses
the idea of infinity, and can gauge in advance the return of affirma-
tion behind the negation. But to possess the idea of infinity is to have
already welcomed the Other.

d)   OBJECTIVITY AND LANGUAGE

Thus the silent world would be an-archic. Knowing could not com-
mence in it. But already as an-archic, at the limit of non-sense, its
presence to consciousness lies in its expectation for a word that does
not come. Thus it appears within a relation with the Other, as the sign
the Other delivers, even if he dissimulates his face, that is, declines the
assistance he would have to bring to the signs he delivers, and which he
• De /'existence tl l'existant (Paris, 1947), pp. 93-105.-Trans.
•• "A grlment." The sensibility, which does not "affirm," does "agree to" the
agreeableness, or pleasure, of the element enjoyed.
94                         Totality and Infinity
delivers, consequently, in equivocation. A world absolutely silent, indif-
ferent to the word never uttered, silent in a silence that does not permit
the divining, behind the appearances, of anyone that signals this world
and signals himself by signaling this world-be it to lie through the
appearances, as an evil genius-a world so silent could not even present
itself as a spectacle.
In fact, a spectacle is contemplated only in the measure that it has a
meaning. The meaningful [sense] is not posterior to the "seen," to the
"sensible," of themselves meaningless, which our thought would work
over or modify in a certain way in accordance with a priori categories.
Once the indissoluble bond that connects apparition with signification
was understood, an effort was made to render the apparition posterior to
signification by situating it within the finality of our practical behavior.
What only appears, "pure objectivity," the "nothing but objective"
would be only a residue of this practical finality from which it would
derive its meaning. Whence the priority of care over contemplation, the
enrootedness of cognition in a comprehension that opens upon the "world-
hood" of the world, and opens the horizon for the apparition of the
object.
The objectivity of the object is thereby being underestimated. The
ancient thesis that puts representation at the basis of every practical
behavior-taxed with intellectualism-is too hastily discredited. The
most penetrating gaze can not discover in the thing its function as an
implement; does a simple suspension of action suffice to apperceive the
tool as a thing?
Moreover, is practical significance the primordial domain of meaning?
Does it not presuppose the presence of a thought to which it appears and
before which it acquires this meaning? Does it suffice, by its own
operation, to make this thought arise?
Qua practical, signification refers ultimately to the being that exists in
view of this very existence. It is thus derived from a term that is of
itself an end. Thus he who comprehends the signification is indispensible
for the series in which the things acquire a meaning, as the end of the
series. The reference that signification implies would terminate where
the reference is made from self to self-in enjoyment. The process from
which beings would derive their meaning would not only in fact be finite,
but as a finality it would by essence consist in proceeding to a term, in
coming to an end [ a finir]. But the outcome is the point at which every
signification is precisely lost. Enjoyment, the satisfaction and egoism of
C. Truth and Justice                            9S
the I, is an outcome in function of which beings take on or lose their
signification as means according as they are situated on the way that leads
to it or away from it. But the means themselves lose their signification
in the outcome. The end is unconscious as soon as it is reached. By
what right could the innocence of unconscious satisfaction be said to
illuminate things with signification, while it itself is assuagement?
In fact signification has always been envisaged on the level of relations.
A relation did not appear to be an intelligible content, which could be
fixed intuitively; it was signifying by virtue of the system of relations into
which it itself entered. Thus throughout the whole of Western philoso-
phy, since the late philosophy of Plato, the comprehension of the intelligi-
ble appears as a movement and never as an intuition. It is Husserl who
transforms relations into correlatives of a gaze that fixes them and takes
them as contents. He brings forward the idea of a signification and an
intelligibility intrinsic to the content as such, of the luminosity of a
content ( in clarity yet more than in distinction, which is relativity, since
it detaches the object from something other than itself). But it is not
certain that this autopresentation in the light could have meaning of
itself. And idealism, the Sinngebung by the subject, concludes all this
realism of meaning.
In fact signification is maintained only in the breach of the ultimate
unity of the satisfied being. Things begin to take on signification in
the care of the being that is still "on the way." Thus consciousness
itself has been derived from this breach. The intelligible would result
from the non-satisfaction, the provisional indigence of this being, its
remaining short of its accomplishment. But by what miracle is this
possible-if the outcome is the completed being, if the act is more than
the potency ?
Must we not rather think that the calling in question of satisfaction,
which is a becoming aware of it, does not come from its failing, but from
an event for which the process of finality cannot serve as the prototype?
The consciousness that spoils happiness goes beyond happiness and
does not lead us back over the paths that led to it. The conscious-
ness that spoils happiness and gives signification to happiness and to
finality, and to the finalist concatenation of implements and their users,
does not come out of finality. Objectivity, where being is proposed to
consciousness, is not a residue of finality. The objects are not objects
when they offer themselves to the hand that uses them, to the mouth and
the nose, the eyes and the ears that enjoy them. Objectivity is not what
96                         Totality and Infinity
remains of an implement or a food when separated from the world in
which their being comes into play. It is posited in a discourse, in a con-
versation [entre-tien] which proposes the world. This proposition is
held between [se tient entre] two points which do not constitute a
system, a cosmos, a totality.
The objectivity of the object and its signification comes from language.
This way the object is posited as a theme offered envelops the instance
of signifying-not the referring of the thinker who fixes it to what is
signified ( and is part of the same system), but the manifesting of the
signifier, the issuer of the sign, an absolute alterity which nonetheless
speaks to him and thereby thematizes, that is, proposes a world. The
world precisely qua proposed, qua expression, has a meaning, but for this
very reason is never in the original. For a signification to be given
leibhaft, to exhaust its being in an exhaustive apparition, is an absurdity.
But the non-originality of what has a meaning is not a lesser being, a
reference to a reality it imitate~, reverberates, or symbolizes. The
meaningful refers to a signifier. The sign does not signify the signifier as
it signifies the signified. The signified is never a complete presence;
always a sign in its turn, it does not come in a straightforward frankness.
The signifier, he who emits the sign, faces, despite the interposition of the
sign, without proposing himself as a theme. He can, to be sure, speak of
himself-but then he would announce himself as signified and conse-
quently as a sign in his turn. The Other, the signifier, manifests himself
in speech by speaking of the world and not of himself ; he manifests
himself by proposing the world, by thematizing it.
Thematization manifests the Other because the proposition that posits
and offers the world does not float in the air, but promises a response to
him who receives this proposition, who directs himself toward the
Other because in his proposition he receives the possibility of questioning.
Questioning is not explained by astonishment only, but by the presence of
him to whom it is addressed. A proposition is maintained in the out-
stretched field of questions and answers. A proposition is a sign which
is already interpreted, which provides its own key. The presence of
the interpretative key in the sign to be interpreted is precisely the pres-
ence of the other in the proposition, the presence of him who can come
to the assistance of his discourse, the teaching quality of all speech. Oral
discourse is the plenitude of discourse.
Signification or intelligibility does not arise from the identity of the
same who remains in himself, but from the face of the other who calls
C. Truth and Justice                           91
upon the same. Signification does not arise because the same has needs,
because he lacks something, and hence all that is susceptible of filling this
lack takes on meaning. Signification is in the absolute surplus of the
other with respect to the same who desires him, who desires what he does
not lack, who welcomes the other across themes which the other proposes
to him or receives from him, without absenting himself from the signs
thus given. Signification arises from the other stating or understanding
the world, which precisely is thematized in his language or his under-
standing. Signification starts with the speech in which the world is at
the same time thematized and interpreted, in which the signifier never
separates himself from the sign he delivers, but takes it up again always
while he exposes. For this assistance always given to the word which
posits the things is the unique essence of language.
The signification of beings is manifested not in the perspective of
finality, but in that of language. A relation between terms that resist
totalization, that absolve themselves from the relation or that specify it,
is possible only as language. The resistance of one term to the other is
not due to the obscure and hostile residue of alterity, but, on the
contrary, to the inexhaustible surplus of attention which speech, ever
teaching, brings me. For speech is always a taking up again of what
was a simple sign cast forth by it, an ever renewed promise to clarify
what was obscure in the utterance.
To have meaning is to be situated relative to an absolute, that is, to
come from that alterity that is not absorbed in its being perceived. Such
an alterity is possible only as a miraculous abundance, an inexhaustible
surplus of attention arising in the ever recommenced effort of language to
clarify its own manifestation. To have meaning is to teach or to be
taught, to speak or to be able to be stated.
In the perspective of finality and enjoyment signification appears only
in labor, which implies enjoyment impeded. But enjoyment impeded
would by itself engender no signification but only suffering did it not
occur in a world of objects, that is, in a world where speech has already
resounded.
The function of being origin does not fall to an end that, within a
referential system, would refer to itself ( such as the being for itself
characteristic of consciousness). Commencement and end are not ulti-
mate concepts in the same sense. The "for itself" closes in upon itself
and, satisfied, loses all signification; to him who approaches it it appears
as enigmatic as any other apparition. The origin is what provides the
98                         Totality and Infinity
key to its own enigma-what provides the word for it. Language is ex-
ceptional in that it attends its own manifestation. Speech consists
in explaining oneself with respect to speech; it is a teaching. Appari-
tion is a congealed form from which someone has already withdrawn,
whereas in language there is accomplished the unintermittent affiux of a
presence that rends the inevitable veil of its own apparition, which is
plastic like every apparition. Apparition reveals and conceals; speech
consists in surmounting, in a total frankness ever renewed, the dissimu-
lation inevitable in every apparition. Thereby a sense-an orientation-
is given to every phenomenon.
The commencement of knowing is itself possible only if the bewitch-
ment and the permanent equivocation of a world in which every ap-
parition is a possible dissimulation, where commencement is wanting,
is dispelled. Speech introduces a principle into this anarchy. Speech dis-
enchants, for the speaking being guarantees his own apparition and
comes to the assistance of himself, attends his own manifestation. His
being is brought about in this attendance. The speech which already
dawns in the face that looks at me looking introduces the primary frank-
ness of revelation. In function of it th'! world is oriented, that is, takes
on signification. 1n function of the word the world commences, which is
not equivalent to the formula: the world issues in speech. The world
is said and hence can be a theme, can be proposed. The entry of beings
into a proposition constitutes the original event of their taking on signifi-
cation; the possibility of their algorithmic expression itself will be estab-
lished on this basis. Speech is thus the origin of all signification-of
tools and all human works-for through it the referential system from
which every signification arises receives the very principle of its function-
ing, its key. Language is not one modality of symbolism; every symbol-
ism refers already to language.
e) LANGUAGE AND ATTENTION
As an attendance of being at its own presence, speech is a teaching.
Teaching does not simply transmit an abstract and general content
already common to me and the Other. It does not merely assume an
after all subsidiary function of being midwife to a mind already pregnant
with its fruit. Speech first founds community by giving, by presenting
the phenomenon as given; and it gives by thematizing. The given is the

• The French sens means both "meaning" and "direction."
C. Truth and Justice                            99
work of a sentence. In the sentence the apparition loses its phenomenal-
ity in being fixed as a theme; in contrast with the silent world, ambiguity
infinitely magnified, stagnant water, water stilled with mystification that
passes for mystery, the proposition relates the phenomenon to the exist-
ent, to exteriority, to the Infinity of the other uncontained by my
thought. It defines. The definition that situates the object within its
genus presupposes the definition that consists in disengaging the amor-
phous phenomenon from its confusion to orient it in function of the
Absolute, its origin, to thematize it. Every logical definition-per gene-
sim or per genus et diff erentiam speci/icam-already presupposes this
thematization, this entry into a world in which sentences resound.
The very objectification of truth refers to language. The infinite,
against which every definition stands out, is not defined, does not offer
itself to the gaze, but signals itself, not as a theme but as thematizing, as
him starting from whom everything can be fixed in its identity. But also
he signals himself by attending the work that signals him; he does not
only signal himself, but speaks, is a face.
Teaching, the end of equivocation or confusion, is a thematization
of phenomena. It is because phenomena have been taught to me
by him who presents himself-by reviving the acts of this thematization
which are the signs-by speaking-that henceforth I am not the play-
thing of a mystification, but consider objects. The presence of the
Other dispels the anarchic sorcery of the facts: the world becomes an
object. To be an object, to be a theme, is to be what I can speak of with
someone who has broken through the screen of phenomena and has
associated me with himself. We shall speak later of the structure of this
association, a structure which, as we have intimated, can only be moral,
such that truth is founded on my relationship with the other, or justice.
To put speech at the origin of truth is to abandon the thesis that dis-
closure, which implies the solitude of vision, is the first work of truth.
Thematization as the work of language, as an action exercised by the
Master on me, is not a mysterious information, but the appeal ad-
dressed to my attention. Attention and the explicit thought it makes
possible are not a refinement of consciousness, but consciousness itself.
But the eminently sovereign attention in me is what essentially responds
to an appeal. Attention is attention to something because it is attention
to someone. The exteriority of its point of departure is essential to it: it
is the very tension of the I. The school, without which no thought is
explicit, conditions science. It is there that is affirmed the exteriority
100                         Totality and Infinity
that accomplishes freedom and does not offend it: the exteriority of the
Master. Thought can become explicit only among two; explicitation is
not limited to finding what one already possessed. But the first teaching
of the teacher is his very presence as teacher from which representation
comes.

f)   LANGUAGE AND JUSTICE

But what can it mean that the teacher who calls forth attention exceeds
the consciousness? How is the teacher outside of the consciousness he
teaches? He is not exterior to it as the content thought is exterior to the
thought that thinks it; this exteriority is assumed by thought, and in
this sense does not overflow the consciousness. Nothing that concerns
thought can overflow it; everything is freely assumed. N othing-excePt
the judge judging the very freedom of thought. The presence of the
Master who by his word gives meaning to phenomena and permits
them to be thematized is not open to an objective knowing; this presence
is in society with me. The presence of being in the phenomenon, which
breaks the charm of the bewitched world, which utters the yes of which
the I is incapable, which brings the preeminent positivity of the Other,
is ipso facto as-sociation. But the reference to commencement is not
a knowing of the commencement; quite the contrary: every objectification
already refers to this reference. Association, a preeminent experience of
being, does not disclose. One may call it a disclosure of what is revealed
-the experience of a face; but one thus con ju res away the originality of
this disclosure. In this disclosure there disappears precisely the con-
sciousness of solitary certitude in which every knowing is enacted, even
that one can have of a face. Certitude rests, in fact, on my freedom, and
is in this sense solitary. Whether it be through a priori concepts which
enable me to assume the given, or whether it be by adherence of the will
(as in Descartes), it is finally my freedom alone that takes the responsi-
bility for the true. As-sociation, the welcoming of the master, is the op-
posite course: in it the exercise of my freedom is called in question. If
we call a situation where my freedom is called in question conscience, as-
sociation or the welcoming of the Other is conscience. The originality
of this situation does not only lie in the formal antithesis it represents with
regard to the cognitive consciousness. The calling in question of oneself
is all the more severe the more rigorously the self is in control of itself.
This receding of the goal in the very measure one approaches it is the !ife
of conscience. The increase of my exigencies with regard to myself
C. Truth and Justice                       101
aggravates the judgment that is borne upon me, increases my responsi-
bility. It is in this very concrete sense that the judgment that is borne
upon me is never assumed by me. This inability to assume is the very
life, the essence, of conscience. My freedom does not have the last word;
I am not alone. And we shall say then that conscience alone leaves itself.
In other words again, in conscience I have an experience that is not com-
mensurate with any a priori framework-a conceptless experience.
Every other experience is conceptual, that is, becomes my own or arises
from my freedom. We have just described the essential insatiability of
conscience, which does not belong to the order of hunger or satiety. It
is thus that above we defined desire. Conscience and desire are not
modalities of consciousness among others, but its condition. Concretely
they are the welcoming of the Other across his judgment.
The transitivity of teaching, and not the interiority of reminiscence,
manifests being; the locus of truth is society. The moral relation with
the Master who judges me subtends the freedom of my adherence
to the true. Thus language commences. He who speaks to me and
across the words proposes himself to me retains the fundamental foreign-
ness of the Other who judges me; our relations are never reversible.
This supremacy posits him in himself, outside of my knowing, and it is
by relation to this absolute that the given takes on meaning.
The "communication" of ideas, the reciprocity of dialogue, already
hide the profound essence of language. It resides in the irreversibility of
the relation between me and the other, in the Mastery of the Master
coinciding with his position as other and as exterior. For language can
be spoken only if the interlocutor is the commencement of his discourse,
if, consequently, he remains beyond the system, if he is not on the same
plane as myself. The interlocutor is not a Thou, he is a You;* he
reveals himself in his lordship. Thus exteriority coincides with a mas-
tery. My freedom is thus challenged by a Master who can invest it.
Truth, the sovereign exercise of freedom, becomes henceforth possible.

## D. Separation And
ABSOLUTENESS


The same and the other at the same time maintain themselves in
relationship and absolve themselves from this relation, remain absolutely
separated. The idea of Infinity requires this separation. It was posited
as the ultimate structure of being, as the production of its very
infinitude. Society accomplishes it concretely. But is not to broach
being on the level of separation to broach it in its fallenness? The
positions we have outlined oppose the ancient privilege of unity which is
affirmed from Parmenides to Spinoza and Hegel. Separation and interi-
ority were held to be incomprehensible and irrational. The metaphysical
knowledge which puts the same in touch with the other then would reflect
this fallenness. Metaphysics would endeavor to suppress separation,
to unite; the metaphysical being should absorb the being of the meta-
physician. The de facto separation with which metaphysics begins would
result from an illusion or a fault. As a stage the separated being
traverses on the way of its return to its metaphysical source, a moment of
a history that will be concluded by union, metaphysics would be an
Odyssey, and its disquietude nostalgia. But the philosophy of unity has
never been able to say whence came this accidental illusion and fall,
inconceivable in the Infinite, the Absolute, and the Perfect.
To conceive separation as a fall or privation or provisional rupture of
the totality is to know no other separation than that evinced by need.
Need indicates void and lack in the needy one, its dependence on the
exterior, the insufficiency of the needy being precisely in that it does not
entirely possess its being and consequently is not strictly speaking sepa-
rate. One of the ways of Greek metaphysics consisted in seeking the
return to and the fusion with Unity. But Greek metaphysics conceived
the Good as separate from the totality of essences, and in this way
(without any contribution from an alleged Oriental thought) it caught
sight of a structure such that the totality could admit of a beyond. The
102
D. Separation and~ bsoluteness                     103
Good is Good in itself and not by relation to the need to which it is
wanting; it is a luxury with respect to needs. It is precisely in this that
it is beyond being. When, above, disclosure was contrasted with revela-
tion, in which truth is expressed and illuminates us before we sought it,
the notion of the Good in itself was already being taken up anew.
Plotinus returns to Parmenides when he represents the apparition of the
essence from the One by emanation and by descent. Plato nowise deduces
being from the Good: he posits transcendence as surpassing the totality.
Alongside of needs whose satisfaction amounts to filling a void, Plato
catches sight also of aspirations that are not preceded by suffering and
lack, and in which we recognize the pattern of Desire : the need of
him who lacks nothing, the aspiration of him who possesses his being
entirely, who goes beyond his plenitude, who has the idea of Infinity.
The Place of the Good above every essence is the most profound teach-
ing, the definitive teaching, not of theology, but of philosophy. The
paradox of an Infinity admitting a being outside of itself which it does
not encompass, and accomplishing its very infinitude by virtue of this
proximity of a separated being-in a word, the paradox of creation-
thenceforth loses something of its audacity.
But then it is necessary to cease interpreting separation as pure and
simple diminution of the Infinite, a degradation. Separation with
regard to the Infinite, compatible with the Infinite, is not a simple "fall"
of the Infinite. Though being better than the relations connecting the
finite to the infinite formally, in the abstract, the relations with the Good
are announced through an apparent diminution. The diminution counts
only if, by abstract thought, one retains from separation (and
from the creature) its finitude, instead of situating finitude within the
transcendence by which it opens to Desire and goodness. The ontology
of human existence, philosophical anthropology, endlessly paraphrases
this abstract thought by insisting, with pathos, on finitude. In reality
what is at issue is an order where the very notion of the Good first takes
on meaning; what is at issue is society. Here the relation connects not
terms that complete one another and consequently are reciprocally lack-
ing to one another, but terms that suffice to themselves. This relation is
Desire, the life of beings that have arrived at self-possession. Infinity
thought concretely, that is, starting with the separated being turned
toward it, surpasses itself. In other words, it opens to itself the order of
the Good. In saying that infinity is thought concretely starting with the
separated being turned toward it we are nowise taking a thought that
104                        Totality and Infinity
starts with the separated being to be relative. Separation is the very con-
stitution of thought and interiority, that is, a relationship within
independence.
Infinity is produced by withstanding the invasion of a totality, in a
contraction that leaves a place for the separated being. Thus relation-
ships that open up a way outside of being take form. An infinity that
does not close in upon itself in a circle but withdraws from the ontologi-
cal extension so as to leave a place for a separated being exists divinely.
Over and beyond the totality it inaugurates a society. The relations that
are established between the separated being and Infinity redeem what
diminution there was in the contraction creative of Infinity. Man
redeems creation. Society with God is not an addition to God nor a
disappearance of the interval that separates God from the creature. By
contrast with totalization we have called it religion. Multiplicity and
the limitation of the creative Infinite are compatible with the perfection
of the Infinite; they articulate the meaning of this perfection.
Infinity opens the order of the Good. It is an order that does not
contradict, but goes beyond the rules of formal logic. The distinction
between need and Desire can not be reflected in formal logic, where desire
is always forced into the forms of need. From this purely formal neces-
sity comes the force of Parmenidean philosophy. But the order of Desire,
the relationship between strangers who are not wanting to one another
-desire in its positivity-is affirmed across the idea of creation ex nihilo.
Then the plane of the needy being, avid for its complements, vanishes,
and the possibility of a sabbatical existence, where existence suspends the
necessities of existence, is inaugurated. For an existent is an existent only
in the measure that it is free, that is, outside of any system, which implies
dependence. Every restriction put on freedom is a restriction put on
being. For this reason multiplicity is taken to be the ontological fallen-
ness of beings mutually limiting one another in their proximity.
Since Parmenides across Plotinus we have not succeeded in thinking
otherwise. For multiplicity seemed to us to be united in a totality, of
which the multiplicity could be but an appearance-moreover inex-
plicable. But the idea of creation ex nihilo expresses a multiplicity not
united into a totality; the creature is an existence which indeed does de-
pend on an other, but not as a part that is separated from it. Creation
ex nihilo breaks with system, posits a being outside of every system, that
is, there where its freedom is possible. Creation leaves to the creature a
trace of dependence, but it is an unparalleled dependence: the dependent
D. Separation and Absoluteness                     105
being draws from this exceptional dependence, from this relationship, its
very independence, its exteriority to the system. What is essential to
created existence is not the limited character of its being, and the concrete
structure of the creature is not deducible from this finitude. What is
essential to created existence is its separation with regard to the Infinite.
This separation is not simply a negation. Accomplished as psychism, it
precisely opens upon the idea of Infinity.
Thought and freedom come to us from separation and from the
consideration of the Other-this thesis is at the antipodes of
Spinozism.
SECTION II


## Interiority And Economy
## A. Separation As Life


1. Intentionality and the Social Relation
In describing the metaphysical relation as disinterested, as disengaged
from all participation, we would be wrong to recognize in it intentional-
ity, the consciousness of . . . , simultaneously proximity and distance.
For this Husserlian term evokes the relation with the object, the posited,
the thematic, whereas the metaphysical relation does not link up a subject
with an object. It is not that our intent be anti-intellectualist. In
contradistinction to the philosophers of existence we will not found the
relation with the existent respected in its being, and in this sense abso-
lutely exterior, that is, metaphysical, on being in the world, the care and
doing characteristic of the Heideggerian Dasein. Doing, labor, already
implies the relation with the transcendent. If cognition in the form
of the objectifying act does not seem to us to be at the level of the
metaphysical relation, this is not because the exteriority contemplated
as an object, the theme, would withdraw from the subject as fast as the
abstractions proceed; on the contrary it does not withdraw enough.
The contemplation of objects remains close to action; it disposes
of its theme, and consequently comes into play on a plane where one
being limits another. Metaphysics approaches without touching. Its
way is not an action, but is the social relation. But we maintain that the
social relation is experience preeminently, for it takes place before the
existent that expresses himself, that is, remains in himself. In dis-
tinguishing between the objectifying act and the metaphysical we are
on our way not to the denunciation of intellectualism but to its very
strict development-if it is true that the intellect desires being in itself.
It will therefore be necessary to show the difference that separates the
relations analogous to transcendence from those of transcendence itself.
The relations of transcendence lead to the other, whose mode the idea of
Infinity has enabled us to specify. Even if they rest on transcendence,
the relations analogous to transcendence, and the objectifying act among
them, remain within the same.
109
110                       Totality and Infinity
The analysis of the relations that are produced within the same, to
which the present section is devoted, will in reality describe the interval
of separation. The formal pattern of separation is not that of every
relation-a simultaneity of distance between the terms and their union.
In the case of separation the union of the terms maintains separation in
an eminent sense. The being that is in relation absolves itself from the
relation, is absolute within relationship. I ts concrete analysis as it is
undertaken by a being who accomplishes it ( and who does not cease to
accomplish it while analyzing it) will, we have indicated, recognize
separation as inner life, or as psychism. But in turn this interiority
will appear as a presence at home with oneself, which means inhabitation
and economy. The psychism and the perspectives it opens maintain the
distance that separates the metaphysician from the metaphysical, and
their resistance to totalization.


2. Living from • ••* (Enjoyment)
The Notion of Accomplishment
We live from "good soup," air, light, spectacles, work, ideas, sleep,
etc..•. These are not objects of representations. We live from them.
Nor is what we live from a "means of life," as the pen is a means with
respect to the letter it permits us to write-nor a goal of life, as
communication is the goal of the letter. The things we live from are not
tools, nor even implements, in the Heideggerian sense of the term.
Their existence is not exhausted by the utilitarian schematism that
delineates them as having the existence of hammers, needles, or machines.
They are always in a certain measure-and even the hammers, needles,
and machines are--objects of enjoyment, presenting themselves to
"taste," already adorned, embellished. Moreover, whereas the recoun,e
to the instrument implies finality and indicates a dependence with regard
to the other, living from . . . delineates independence itself, the inde-
pendence of enjoyment and of its happiness, which is the original pattern
of all independence.
Conversely, the independence of happiness always depends on a con-
tent: it is the joy or the pain of breathing, looking, eating, working,
handling the hammer and the machine, etc. But the dependence of

• "Vivre de. • .." While we are uniformedly translating this as "living
from .•• ," sometimes "living on •••" would be more appropriate,-Trana.
A. Separation as Life                         111
happiness on the content is not that of the effect on a cause. The
contents from which life lives are not always indispensable to it for the
maintenance of that life, as means or as the fuel [carburant] necessary
for the "functioning" of existence. Or at least they are not lived as such.
With them we die, and sometimes prefer to die rather than be without
them. Still the "moment" of restoration, for example, is phenomenolo-
gically included in the nourishing of oneself, and it is even the essential,
though, in order to account for it, we do not have to resort to any of the
knowledge a physiologist or economist possesses. Nourishment, as a
means of invigoration, is the transmutation of the other into the same,
which is in the essence of enjoyment: an energy that is other, recognized
as other, recognized, we will see, as sustaining the very act that is
directed upon it, becomes, in enjoyment, my own energy, my strength,
me. All enjoyment is in this sense alimentation. Hunger is need, is
privation in the primal sense of the word, and thus precisely living
from . . . is not a simple becoming conscious of what fills life. These
contents are lived: they feed life. One lives one's life: to live is a sort of
transitive verb, and the contents of life are its direct objects. And the
act of living these contents is ipso fac}o a content of life. The relation
with the direct object of the verb to exist ( which, since the philoso-
phers of existence, has become transitive) in fact resembles the relation
with nourishment, where there is a relation with an object and at the
same time a relation with this relation which also nourishes and fills life.
One does not only exist one's pain or one's joy; one exists from pains and
joys. Enjoyment is precisely this way the act nourishes itself with its
own activity. To live from bread is therefore neither to represent bread
to oneself nor to act on it nor to act by means of it. To be sure, it is
necessary to earn one's bread, and it is necessary to nourish oneself in
order to earn one's bread; thus the bread I eat is also that with which I
earn my bread and my life. But if I eat my bread in order to labor and
to live, I live from my labor and from my bread. Bread and labor do
not, in the Pascalian sense, divert me from the bare fact of existence or
occupy the emptiness of my time: enjoyment is the ultimate consciousness
of all the contents that fill my life--it embraces them. The life that I
earn is not a bare existence; it is a life of labor and nourishments; these
are contents which do not preoccupy it only, but which "occupy" it,
which "entertain" it, of which it is enjoyment. Even if the content
of life ensures my life, the means is immediately sought as an end, and the
pursuit of this end becomes an end in its turn. Thus things are always
112                        Totality and Infinity
more than the strictly necessary; they make up the grace of life. We live
from our labor which ensures our subsistence; but we also live from our
labor because it fills ( delights or saddens) life. The first meaning
of "to live from one's labor" reverts to the second-if the things are in
place. Qua object the object seen occupies life; but the vision of the
object makes up the "joy" of life.
This does not mean that there is here a vision of vision: life's relation
with its own dependence on the things is enjoyment-which, as happi-
ness, is independence. The acts of life are not straightforward [droits]
and as it were strained toward their finality. We live in the conscious-
ness of consciousness, but this consciousness of consciousness is not reflec-
tion. It is not knowing but enjoyment, and, as we shall say, the very
egoism of life.
To say that we live from contents is therefore not to affirm that we
resort to them as to conditions for ensuring our life, taken as the bare
fact of existing. The bare fact of life is never bare. Life is not the
naked will to be, an ontological Sorge for this life. Life's relation with
the very conditions of its life becomes the nourishment and content of
that life. Life is love of life, a relation with contents that are not my
being but more dear than my being: thinking, eating, sleeping, reading,
working, warming oneself in the sun. Distinct from my substance
but constituting it, these contents make up the worth [prix] of my life.
When reduced to pure and naked existence, like the existence of
the shades Ulysses visits in Hades, life dissolves into a shadow. Life is an
existence that does not precede its essence. I ts essence makes up its worth
[prix] ; and here value [ valeur] constitutes being. The reality of life is
already on the level of happiness, and in this sense beyond ontology.
Happiness is not an accident of being, since being is risked for
happiness.
If "living from ••• " is not simply a representation of something, "liv-
ing from . . ." also does not fit into the categories of activity and
potency, determinative for Aristotelian ontology. The Aristotelian act
was equivalent to being. Placed within a system of ends and means, man
actualized himself in exceeding his apparent limits by action. Like every
other nature, human nature accomplished itself, that is, became entirely
itself, by functioning, by entering into relations. Every being is an
exercise of being, and the identification of thought with action then is
non-metaphorical. If living from . . . , enjoyment, likewise consists
in entering into relation with something other, this relation does not
A. Separation as Life                        113
take form on the plane of pure being. Moreover, action itself, which
unfolds on the plane of being, enters into our happiness. We live from
acts-and from the very act of being, just as we live from ideas and
sentiments. What I do and what I am is at the same time that from
which I live. VVe relate ourselves to it with a relation that is neither
theoretical nor practical. Behind theory and practice there is enjoyment
of theory and of practice: the egoism of life. The final relation is
enjoyment, happiness.
Enjoyment is not a psychological state among others, the affective
tonality of empiricist psychology, but the very pulsation of the I. In
enjoyment we maintain ourselves always at the second power, which,
however, is not yet the level of reflection. For happiness, in which we
move already by the simple fact of living, is always beyond being, in
which the things are hewn. It is an outcome, but one where the memory
of the aspiration confers upon the outcome the character of an accom-
plishment, which is worth more than ataraxy. Pure existing is ataraxy;
happiness is accomplishment. Enjoyment is made of the memory of its
thirst; it is a quenching. It is the act that remembers its "potency." It
does not express (as Heidegger would have it) the mode of my implanta-
tion-my disposition-in being, the tonus of my bearing. It is not my
bearing in being, but already the exceeding of being; being itself "be-
falls" him who can seek happiness as a new glory above substantiality;
being itself is a content which makes up the happiness or unhappiness of
him who does not simply realize his nature but seeks in being a triumph
inconceivable in the order of substances. Substances are only what they
are. The independence of happiness is therefore to be distinguished from
the independence that, for philosophers, substance possesses. It is as
though the existent could aspire to a new triumph above and beyond the
plenitude of being. To be sure, the objection can be brought against us
that the imperfection of the existing an existent disposes of alone renders
this triumph possible and precious, and that the triumph can coincide
only with the plenitude of existing. But we shall then say that the
strange possibility of an incomplete being is already the opening of the
order of happiness and the ransom paid for this promise of an independ-
ence higher than substantiality.
Happiness is a condition for activity, if activity means a commence-
ment occurring in duration, which nevertheless is continuous. Action
implies being, to be sure, but it marks a beginning and an end in an
anonymous being-where end and beginning have no meaning. But
114                        Totality and Infinity
within this continuity enjoyment realizes independence with regard to
continuity: each happiness comes for the first time. Subjectivity origi-
nates in the independence and sovereignty of enjoyment.
Plato speaks of the soul that feasts on truths. 1 He discerns in rational
thought, in which the sovereignty of the soul is manifested, a relation
with the object that is not only contemplative but confirms the same
( characteristic of the thinker) in its sovereignty. In the meadow that
lies in the plain of truth "that pasturage is found which is suited to the
highest part of the soul; and the wing on which the soul soars is
nourished with this." 2 What enables the soul to rise to truth is nour-
ished with truth. Throughout this book we are opposing the full
analogy drawn between truth and nourishment, because metaphysical
Desire is above life, and with regard to it one cannot speak of satiety.
But the Platonic image describes, with regard to thought, the very
relationship that will be accomplished by life, where the attachment
to the contents that fill it provides it with a supreme content. The
consumption of foods is the food of life.

3. Enjoyment and Independence
We have said that to live from something does not amount to drawing
vital energy from somewhere. Life does not consist in seeking and
consuming the fuel furnished by breathing and nourishment, but, if we
may so speak, in consummating terrestrial and celestial nourishments.
Though it thus depends on what is not itself, this dependence is not with-
out a counterpart which in the final analysis nullifies it. What we live
from does not enslave us; we enjoy it. Need cannot be interpreted as a
simple lack, despite the psychology of need given by Plato, nor as
pure passivity, despite Kantian ethics. The human being thrives on his
needs; he is happy for his needs. The paradox of "living from some-
thing," or, as Plato would say, the folly of these pleasures, is precisely
in a complacency with regard to what life depends on-not a mastery
on the one hand and a dependence on the other, but a mastery in this
dependence. This is perhaps the very definition of complacency and
pleasure. Living from . . . is the dependency that turns into sover-
eignty, into happiness-essentially egoist. Need-the vulgar Venus-is
also, in a certain sense, the child of 1ropos and of 1rEv£a; it is 1rEvla as
1
Phaedrus, 246e.
2   Phaedrus, 248b-c.
A. Separation as Life                          115
source of 1r6pos, in contrast with desire, which is the 11'Evla of 1r6pos.
What it lacks is its source of plenitude and wealth. Need, a happy
dependence, is capable of satisfaction, like a void, which gets filled.
Physiology, from the exterior, teaches us that need is a lack. That man
could be happy for his needs indicates that in human need the physiologi-
cal plane is transcended, that as soon as there is need we are outside the
categories of being-even though in formal logic the structures of happi-
ness-independence through dependence, or I, or human creature--can-
not show through without contradiction.
Need and enjoyment can not be covered by the notions of activity and
passivity, though they be merged in the notion of finite freedom,
Enjoyment, in relation with nourishment, which is the other of life, is an
independence sui generis, the independence of happiness. The life that is
life from something is happiness. Life is affectivity and sentiment; to
live is to enjoy life. To despair of life makes sense only because origi-
nally life is happiness. Suffering is a failing of happiness; it is not correct
to say that happiness is an absence of suffering. Happiness is made up
not of an absence of needs, whose tyranny and imposed character one
denounces, but of the satisfaction of all needs. For the privation of
need is not just a privation, but is privation in a being that knows the
surplus of happiness, privation in a being gratified. Happiness is accom-
plishment: it exists in a soul satisfied and not in a soul that has extirpated
its needs, a castrated soul. And because life is happiness it is personal.
The personality of the person, the ipseity of the I, which is more than the
particularity of the atom and of the individual, is the particularity of the
happiness of enjoyment. Enjoyment accomplishes the atheist separation;
it deformalizes the notion of separation, which is not a cleavage made in
the abstract, but the existence at home with itself of an autochthonous I.
The soul is not, as in Plato, what "has the care of inanimate being
everywhere" 3 ; it to be sure dwells in what is not itself, but it acquires its
own identity by this dwelling in the "other" (and not logically, by
opposition to the other).


4. Need and Corporeity
If enjoyment is the very eddy of the same, it is not ignorance but
exploitation of the other. The alterity of the other the world is is

a Plzaedrus, 246b.
116                       Totality and Infinity
surmounted by need, which enjoyment remembers and is enkindled by;
need is the primary movement of the same. To be sure, need is also a
dependence with regard to the other, but it is a dependence across time,
a dependence that is not an instantaneous betraying of the same but a
suspension or postponement of dependence, and thus the possibility
to break, by labor and by economy, the very thrust of the alterity upon
which need depends.
In denouncing as illusory the pleasures that accompany the satisfaction
of needs Plato has fixed the negative notion of need: it would be a less, a
lack that satisfaction would make good. The essence of need would be
visible in the need to scratch oneself in scabies, in sickness.* Must we
remain at a philosophy of need that apprehends it in poverty? Poverty is
one of the dangers the liberation of man breaking with the animal and
vegetable condition risks. In need the essential is in this rupture, despite
this risk. To conceive of need as a simple privation is to apprehend it in
the midst of a disorganized society which leaves it neither time nor
consciousness. The distance intercalated between man and the world
on which he depends constitutes the essence of need. A being has de-
tached itself from the world from which it still nourishes itself!
The part of being that has detached itself from the whole in which
it was enrooted disposes of its own being, and its relation with the world
is henceforth only need. It frees itself from all the weight of the
world, from immediate and incessant contacts; it is at a distance. This
distance can be converted into time, and subordinate a world to the
liberated but needy being. There is here an ambiguity of which the body
is the very articulation. Animal need is liberated from vegetable depend-
ence, but this liberation is itself dependence and uncertainty. An ani-
mal's need is inseparable from struggle and fear; the exterior world from
which it is liberated remains a threat. But need is also the time of labor:
a relation with an other yielding its alterity. To be cold, hungry,
thirsty, naked, to seek shelter--all these dependencies with regard to the
world, having become needs, save the instinctive being from anonymous
menaces and constitute a being independent of the world, a veritable
subject capable of ensuring the satisfaction of its needs, which are recog-
nized as material, that is, as admitting of satisfaction. Needs are in my
power; they constitute me as the same and not as dependent on the other.
My body is not only a way for the subject to be reduced to slavery, to de-

• Cf. Philebus 46a.
A. Separation as Life                        117
pend on what is not itself, but is also a way of possessing and of working,
of having time, of overcoming the very alterity of what I have to live
from. The body is the very self-possession by which the I, liberated from
the world by need, succeeds in overcoming the very destitution of this
liberation. We shall return to this further.
Having recognized its needs as material needs, as capable of being
satisfied, the I can henceforth turn to what it does not lack. It
distinguishes the material from the spiritual, opens to Desire. Labor,
however, already requires discourse and consequently the height of the
other irreducible to the same, the presence of the Other. There is no nat-
ural religion; but already human egoism leaves pure nature by virtue
of the human body raised upwards, committed in the direction of height.
This is not its empirical illusion but its ontological production and its
ineffaceable testimony. The "I can" proceeds from this height.
Let us again note the difference between need and Desire: in need I
can sink my teeth into the real and satisfy myself in assimilating the
other; in Desire there is no sinking one's teeth into being, no satiety, but
an uncharted future before me. Indeed the time presupposed by need is
provided me by Desire; human need already rests on Desire. Need
has thus the time to convert this other into the same by labor. I exist
as a body, that is, as raised up, an organ that will be able to grasp and
consequently place itself, in this world on which I depend, before
ends technically realizable. For a body that labors everything is not
already accomplished, already done; thus to be a body is to have time in
the midst of the facts, to be me though living in the other.
This revelation of distance is an ambiguous revelation, for time both
destroys the security of instantaneous happiness, and permits the fragility
thus discovered to be overcome. And it is the relation with the other,
inscribed in the body as its elevation, that makes possible the transfor-
mation of enjoyment into consciousness and labor.


5. Af!ectivity as the Jpseity of the I
We are catching sight of a possibility of rendering the unicity of the I
intelligible. The unicity of the I conveys separation. Separation in the
strictest sense is solitude, and enjoyment-happiness or unhappiness-is
isolation itself.
The I is not unique like the Eiffel Tower or the Mona Lisa. The
unicity of the I does not merely consist in being found in one sample
118                         Totality and Infinity
only, but in existing without having a genus, without being the individua-
tion of a concept. The ipseity of the I consists in remaining outside the
distinction between the individual and the general. The refusal of the
concept is not a resistance to generalization by the Time T,, which is on the
same plane of the concept-and by which the concept is defined, as by an
antithetical term. Here the refusal of the concept is not only one of the
aspects of its being, but its whole content; it is interiority. This refusal
of the concept drives the being that refuses it into the dimension of in-
teriority. It is at home with itself. The I is thus the mode in which
the break-up of totality, which leads to the presence of the absolutely
other, is concretely accomplished. It is solitude par excellence. The
secrecy of the I guarantees the discretion of the totality.
This logically absurd structure of unicity, this non-participation in
genus, is the very egoism of happiness. Happiness, in its relation with
the "other" of nutriments, suffices to itself; it even suffices to itself
because of this relation with the other: it consists in satisfying its needs
and not in suppressing them. Happiness suffices to itself through the
"not sufficing to oneself" proper to need. The lack in enjoyment, which
Plato denounced, does not compromise the instant of sufficiency. The
opposition between the ephemeral and the eternal does not convey the true
meaning of sufficiency, which is the very contraction of the ego. It is an
existence for itself-but not, initially, in view of its own existence.
Nor is it a representation of self by self. It is for itself as in the
expression "each for himself"; for itself as the "famished stomach that
has no ears," capable of killing for a crust of bread, is for itself; for itself
as the surfeited one who does not understand the starving and approaches
him as an alien species, as the philanthropist approaches the destitute.
The self-sufficiency of enjoying measures the egoism or the ipseity
of the Ego and the same. Enjoyment is a withdrawal into oneself, an
involution. What is termed an affective state does not have the dull
monotony of a state, but is a vibrant exaltation in which dawns the self.
For the I is not the support of enjoyment. The "intentional" structure
is here wholly different; the I is the very contraction of sentiment, the
pole of a spiral whose coiling and involution is drawn by enjoyment: the
focus of the curve is a part of the curve. It is precisely as a "coiling," as
a movement toward oneself, that enjoyment comes into play. And now
one can understand in what sense we were able to say above that the I is
an apology: whatever be the transfigurations this egoism will receive from
.t1. Separation as Life                       119
speech, it is for the happiness constitutive of its very egoism that the I
who speaks pleads.
The breach of the totality that is accomplished by the enjoyment of
solitude-or the solitude of enjoyment-is radical. When the critical
presence of the Other will call in question this egoism it will not destroy
its solitude. Solitude will be recognized in the concern for knowing,
which is formulated as a problem of origin-inconceivable in a totality.
To this problem the notion of causality can bring no solution, since it is
precisely a question of a self, a being absolutely isolated, whose isolation
causality would compromise by reinstating it in a series. The notion of
creation alone will be commensurate with such a question, respecting
at the same time the absolute novelty of the I and its attachment to a
principle, its having been called in question. The solitude of the subject
will be recognized also in the goodness in which the apology issues.
The upsurge of the self beginning in enjoyment, where the substantial-
ity of the I is apperceived not as the subject of the verb to be, but
as implicated in happiness ( not belonging to ontology, but to axiology) is
the exaltation of the existent as such. The existent would then not be
justiciable to the "comprehension of being," or ontology. One becomes
a subject of being not by assuming being but in §Ijoying happiness, by the
interiorization of enjoyment which is also an exaltation, an "above
being." The existent is ,1'autonomous" with respect to being; it desig-
nates not a participatiori in beifig, but happiness. The existent par
excellence is man.
When the I is identified with reason, taken as the power of thematiza-
tion and objectification, it loses its very ipseity. To represent to oneself
is to empty oneself of one's subjective substance and to insensibilize enjoy-
ment. By imagining this anaesthesia limitless Spinoza conjures away
separation. But the joy of this intellectual coi~cidence and the freedom
of this obedience mark a cleavage line in the unity won in this way.
Reason makes human society possible; but a society whose members
would be only rqasons would vanish as a society. What could a being
entirely rational speak of with another entirely rational being? Reason
has no plural; how could numerous reasons be distinguished? How
could the Kantian kingdom of ends be possible, had not the rational
beings that compose it retained, as the principle of individuation, their
exigency for happiness, miraculously saved from the shipwreck of sensible
nature? In Kant the I is met with again in this need for happiness.
120                          Totality and Infinity
To be I is to exist in such a way as to be already beyond being, in
happiness. For the I to be means neither to oppose nor to represent
something to itself, nor to use something, nor to aspire to something, but
to en joy something.

6. The I of Enjoyment Is Neither Biological Nor
Sociological
Individuation through happiness individuates a "concept" whose com-
prehension and extension coincide; the individuation of the concept by
self-identification constitutes the content of this concept. The notion of
the separated person which we have approached in the description of en-
joyment, which is posited in the independence of happiness, is to be dis-
tinguished from the notion of person such as it is fabricated by the
philosophy of life or of race. In the exaltation of biological life the
person arises as a product of the species or of impersonal life, which has
recourse to the individual so as to ensure its impersonal triumph.4 The
unicity of the I, its status as a conceptless individual, would disappear in
this participation in what exceeds it.
The pathos of liberalism, which we rejoin on one side, lies in the pro-
motion of a person inasmuch as he represents nothing further, that is, is
precisely a self. Then multiplicity can be produced only if the individu-
als retain their secrecy, if the relation that unites them into a multiplicity
is not visible from the outside, but proceeds from one unto the other. If
it were entirely visible from the outside, if the exterior point of view
would open upon its ultimate reality, the multiplicity would form a
totality in which the individuals would participate; the bond between
persons would not have preserved the multiplicity from addition.
In order that multiplicity be maintained, the relation proceeding from me
to the Other-the attitude of one person with regard to another-must

4 Cf. for example Kurt Schilling, "Einfiihrung in die Staats- und Rechta-

philosophie," in Rechtswissenschaftliche Grundrisse, ed. by Otto Korellreuter
(Berlin, 1939). According to this book, typical of racist philosophy, individual-
ity and sociality would be events of life that proceed individuals and create
them for better adaptation, in order to ensure life. The concept of happiness,
with the individualness it evokes, is lacking in this philosophy. Want-Not-
is what threatens life. The State is but an organization of this multiplicity, in
view of making life possible. To the end the person-even the person of the
leader-remains at the service of life and of the creation of life. The principle
of personality proper is never an end.
,1. Separation as Life                        121
be stronger than the formal signification of conjunction, to which every
relation risks being degraded. This greater force is concretely affirmed
in the fact that the relation proceeding from me to the other cannot be
included within a network of relations visible to a third party. If this
bond between me and the other could be entirely apprehended from the
outside it would suppress, under the gaze that encompassed it, the very
multiplicity bound with this bond. The individuals would appear as
participants in the totality: the Other would amount to a second copy
of the I-both included in the same concept. Pluralism is not a numeri-
cal multiplicity. In order that a pluralism in itself ( which cannot be
reflected in formal logic) be realized there must be produced in depth
the movement from me to the other, an attitude of an I with re-
gard to the Other (an attitude already specified as love or hatred,
obedience or command, learning or teaching, etc. . . . ) , that would not
be a species of relationship in general; this means that the movement
from me to the other could not present itself as a theme to an objective
gaze freed from this confrontation with the other, to a reflection.
Pluralism implies a radical alterity of the other, whom I do not simply
conceive by relation to myself, but confront out of my egoism. The
alterity of the Other is in him and is not relative to me; it reveals
itself. But I have access to it proceeding from myself and not through a
comparison of myself with the other. I have access to the alterity of the
Other from the society I maintain with him, and not by quitting this
relation in order to reflect on its terms. Sexuality supplies the example
of this relation, accomplished before being reflected on: the other sex is
an alterity borne by a being as an essence and not as the reverse of his
identity; but it could not affect an unsexed me. The Other as master
can also serve us as an example of an alterity that is not only by relation
to me, an alterity that, belonging to the essence of the other, is neverthe-
less visible only from an I.
## B. Enjoyment And
REPRESENTATION


What we live from and enjoy is not the same as that life itself. I eat
bread, listen to music, follow the course of my ideas. Though I live
my life, the life I live and the fact of living it nonetheless remain distinct,
even though it is true that this life itself continually and essentially
becomes its own content.
Can this relationship be specified? Is not enjoyment, as the way life
relates to its contents, a form of intentionality in the Husserlian sense,
taken very broadly, as the universal fact of human existence? Every
moment of life ( conscious and even unconscious, such as conscious-
ness divines it) is in relation with an other than that moment itself. We
know the rhythm with which this thesis is exposed: every perception is a
perception of the perceived, every idea an idea of an ideate, every desire a
desire of a desired, every emotion an emotion of something moving
• • • ; but every obscure thought of our being is also oriented toward
something. Every present in its temporal nudity tends toward the future
and returns upon the past or resumes that past-is prospection and
retrospection. Yet already with the first exposition of intentionality as a
philosophical thesis there appeared the privilege of representation. The
thesis that every intentionality is either a representation or founded on a
representation dominates the Logische U ntersuchungen and returns as an
obsession in all of Husserl's subsequent work. What is the relation
between the theoretical intentionality of the objectifying act, as Husserl
calls it, and enjoyment?

1. Representation and Constitution
In order to find an answer we shall try to follow the movement proper
to objectifying intentionality.
This intentionality is a necessary moment of the event of separation in
122
B. Enjoyment and Representation                 123
itself, to whose description this section is devoted, and which is articu-
lated starting with enjoyment in dwelling and in possession. 1 The
possibility of representing to oneself and the resultant temptation to
idealism do indeed profit already from the metaphysical relation and
the relationship with the absolutely other, but they attest separation
in the midst of this very transcendence (although the separation is not
reducible to an echo of transcendence). We shall first describe it
detached from its sources. Taken in itself, as it were uprooted, represen-
tation seems to be oriented in an opposite direction from enjoyment and
will permit us to show by contrast the "intentional" pattern of enjoy-
ment and sensibility (although representation is in fact woven of it
and repeats its event, which is separation).
The Husserlian thesis of the primacy of the objectifying act-in which
was seen Husserl's excessive attachment to theoretical consciousness, and
which has served as a pretext to accuse Husserl of intellectualism ( as
though that were an accusation !)-leads to transcendental philosophy,
to the affirmation (so surprising after the realist themes the idea of
intentionality seemed to approach) that the object of consciousness, while
distinct from consciousness, is as it were a product of consciousness, being
a "meaning" endowed by consciousness, the result of Sinngebung. The
object of representation is to be distinguished from the act of representa-
tion-this is the fundamental and most fecund affirmation of Husserl's
phenomenology, to which a realist import is hastily given. But does
the theory of mental images, betraying a confusion of the act with the
object of consciousness, rest uniquely on a false description of conscious-
ness inspired by the prejudices of a psychological atomism? In a
sense the object of representation is indeed interior to thought: despite its
independence it falls under the power of thought. We are not alluding
to the Berkeleyan ambiguity between the sentient and the sensed within
sensation, and we are not limiting our reflection to objects called
sensible; it is rather a question of what in Cartesian terminology
becomes the clear and distinct idea. In clarity an object which is first
exterior is given that is, is delivered over to him who encounters it
as though it had been entirely determined by him. In clarity the exterior
being presents itself as the work of the thought that receives it.
Intelligibility, characterized by clarity, is a total adequation of the
thinker with what is thought, in the precise sense of a mastery exercised

1 See   pp. 152 ff.
124                        Totality and Infinity
by the thinker upon what is thought in which the object's resistance as an
exterior being vanishes. This mastery is total and as though creative;
it is accomplished as a giving of meaning: the object of representation is
reducible to noemata. The intelligible is precisely what is entirely
reducible to noemata and all of whose relations with the understanding
reducible to those established by the light. In the intelligibility of
representation the distinction between me and the object, between inte-
rior and exterior, is effaced. Descartes's clear and distinct idea mani-
fests itself as true and as entirely immanent to thought: entirely pres-
ent, without anything clandestine; its very novelty is without mystery.
Intelligibility and representation are equivalent notions: an exteri-
ority surrendering in clarity and without immodesty its whole being to
thought, that is, totally present without in principle anything shocking
thought, without thought ever feeling itself to be indiscreet. Clarity is
the disappearance of what could shock. Intelligibility, the very occur-
rence of representation, is the possibility for the other to be determined by
the same without determining the same, without introducing alterity
into it; it is a free exercise of the same. It is the disappearance, within
the same, of the I opposed to the non-I.
Thus, within the work of intentionality, representation occupies the
place of a privileged event. The intentional relation of representation is
to be distinguished from every other relation-from mechanical causal-
ity, from the analytic or synthetic relation of logical formalism, from
every intentionality other than representational-in that in it the same is
in relation with the other but in such a way that the other does not
determine the same; it is always the same that determines the other.
To be sure, representation is the seat of truth: the movement proper to
truth consists in the thinker being determined by the object presented
to him. But it determines him without touching him, without weigh-
ing on him-such that the thinker who submits to what is thought
does so "gracefully," as though the object, even in the surprises it has in
store for cognition, had been anticipated by the subject.
While every activity is in one way or other illuminated by a represen-
tation, hence advances on a terrain already familiar, representation is a
movement proceeding from the same with no searchlight preceding it.
"The soul is something divinatory," 2 according to Plato's expression.
There is an absolute, creative freedom, prior to the venturesome course

2 Phaedru1       242c.
1
B. Enjoyment and Representation                  125
8
of the hand which chances on to the goal it seeks-for at least the vision
of that goal had cleared a passage for it, had been already projected
forth. Representation is this very projection, inventing the goal that
will be presented to the still groping acts as won a priori. The "act" of
representation discovers, properly speaking, nothing before itself.
Representation is pure spontaneity, though prior to all activity. Thus
the exteriority of the object represented appears to reflection to be a
meaning ascribed by the representing subject to an object that is itself
reducible to a work of thought.
The I that thinks the sum of the angles of a triangle is, to be sure, also
determined by this object; it is precisely the one that thinks of this sum,
and not the one that thinks of atomic weight. Whether it remembers
or has forgotten, it is determined by the fact of having passed through
the thought of the sum of the angles. This is what will be visible to the
historian for whom the I representing to itself is already something
represented. At the very moment of representation the I is not marked
by the past but utilizes it as a represented and objective element.
Illusion? Ignorance of its own involvements? Representation is the
force of such an illusion and of such forgettings. Representation is a
pure present. The positing of a pure present without even tangential
ties with time is the marvel of representation. It is a void of time,
interpreted as eternity. To be sure the I who conducts his thoughts
becomes ( or more exactly ages) in time, in which his successive thoughts,
across which he thinks in the present, are spread forth. But this
becoming in time does not appear on the plane of representation: repre-
sentation involves no passivity. The same in relating itself to the other
refuses what is exterior to its own instant, to its own identity, only to
find again in this instant, which owes itself to nothing, which is pure
gratuity, everything that had been refused-as "meaning given," as
noema. I ts first movement is negative : it consists in finding and ex-
hausting in itself the meaning of an exteriority, precisely converti-
ble into noemata. Such is the movement of the Husserlian 21l"OX~, which,
strictly speaking, is characteristic of representation. I ts very possibility
defines representation.
The fact that in representation the same defines the other without
being determined by the other justifies the Kantian conception according
to which the unity of transcendental appreception remains an empty form

8
Cf. p. 167-168.
126                        Totality and Infinity
in the midst of its synthetic work. But we are far from thinking that one
starts with representation as a non-conditioned condition! Representa-
tion is bound to a very different "intentionality," which we are endeavor-
ing to approach throughout this analysis. And its marvelous work of
constitution is especially possible in reflection. It is the "uprooted"
representation that we have analyzed. The way representation is bound
to a "wholly other" intentionality is different from the way the object is
bound to the subject or the subject to history.
The total freedom of the same in representation has a positive condi-
tion in the other that is not something represented, but is the Other.
For the moment let us note that the structure of representation as a
non-reciprocal determination of the other by the same is precisely for the
same to be present and for the other to be present to the same. We call
it "the same" because in representation the I precisely loses its opposition
to its object; the opposition fades, bringing out the identity of the I
despite the multiplicity of its objects, that is, precisely the unalterable
character of the I. To remain the same is to represent to oneself. The
"I think" is the pulsation of rational thought. The identity of the same
unaltered and unalterable in its relations with the other is in fact the I of
representation. The subject that thinks by representation is a subject
that hearkens to its own thought: one has to think of thought as in an
element analogous to sound and not to light. Its own spontaneity is a
surprise for the subject, as though despite its full mastery qua I the I
surprised what was taking place. This inspiration [genialite] is the
very structure of representation: a return in the present thought to the
thought's past, an assuming of this past in the present, a going beyond
this past and this present-as in the Platonic reminiscence, in which
the subject hoists himself up to the eternal. The particular I is one
with the same, coincides with the "daemon" that speaks to it in thought,
and is universal thought. The I of representation is the natural passage
from the particular to the universal. Universal thought is a thought in
the first person. This is why the constitution that for idealism remakes
the universe starting from the subject is not the freedom of an I that
would survive this constitution free and above the laws it will have con-
stituted. The I that constitutes dissolves into the work it comprehends,
and enters into the eternal. The idealist creation is representation.
But this is true only of the I proper to representation-detached from
the conditions of its latent birth. And enjoyment, likewise detached
from concrete conditions, presents a totally different structure, as we
B. Enjoyment and Representation                       127
shall show shortly. For the moment let us note the essential correlation
of intelligibility and representation. To be intelligible is to be repre-
sented and hence to be a priori. To reduce a reality to its content
thought is to reduce it to the same. The thinking thought is the locus
where a total identity and a reality that ought to negate it are reconciled,
without contradiction. The most ponderous reality envisaged as an
object of a thought is engendered in the gratuitous spontaneity of a
thought that thinks it. Every anteriority of the given is reducible to the
instantaneity of thought and, simultaneous with it, arises in the present.
It thereby takes on meaning. To represent is not only to render present
"anew"; it is to reduce to the present an actual perception which flows on.
To represent is not to reduce a past fact to an actual image but to reduce
to the instantaneousness of thought everything that seems independent
of it; it is in this that representation is constitutive. The value of the
transcendental method and its share of eternal truth lies in the universal
possibility of reducing the represented to its meaning, the existent to the
noema, the most astonishing possibility of reducing to a noema the very
being of the existent.


2. Enjoyment and Nourishment
The intentionality of enjoyment can be described by contrast with the
intentionality of representation ; it consists in holding on to the exterior-
ity which the transcendental method involved in representation suspends.
To hold on to exteriority is not simply equivalent to affirming the world,
but is to posit oneself in it corporeally. The body is the elevation, but
also the whole weight of position. The body naked and indigent identi-
fies the center of the world it perceives, but, conditioned by its own
representation of the world, it is thereby as it were torn up from the
center from which it proceeded, as water gushing forth from rock
washes away that rock. The body indigent and naked is not a thing
among things which I "constitute" or see in God to be in a relation with
a thought, nor is it the instrument of a gestural thought, of which theory
would be simply the ultimate development. The body naked and indi-
gent is the very reverting, irreducible to a thought, of representation into
life, of the subjectivity that represents into life which is sustained by these
representations and lives of them; its indigence-its needs---affirm "exte-
riority" as non-constituted, prior to all affirmation.
To doubt that the form that stands out in profiles on the horizon or in
128                        Totality and Infinity
the darkness exists, to impose on a chunk of iron that presents itself a
given form so as to make of it a knife, to overcome an obstacle, or to do
away with an enemy: to doubt, to labor, to destroy, to kill-these
negating acts assume objective exteriority rather than constitute it.
To assume exteriority is to enter into a relation with it such that the
same determines the other while being determined by it. But the way it
is determined does not simply bring us back to the reciprocity designated
by the third Kantian category of relation. The way in which the same is
determined by the other, and which delineates the plane in which the
negating acts themselves are situated, is precisely the way designated
above as "living from . . . . " It is brought about by the body whose
essence is to accomplish my position on the earth, that is, to give me as it
were a vision already and henceforth borne by the very image that I
see. To posit oneself corporeally is to touch an earth, but to do so in such
a way that the touching finds itself already conditioned by the position,
the foot settles into a real which this very action outlines or constitutes-,
as though a painter would notice that he is descending from the picture
he is painting.
Representation consists in the possibility of accounting for the object as
though it were constituted by a thought, as though it were a noema.
And this reduces the world to the unconditioned instant of thought.
In "living from . . . " the process of constitution which comes into
play wherever there is representation is reversed. What I live from
is not in my life as the represented is within representation in the
eternity of the same or in the unconditioned present of cogitation. If
we could still speak of constitution here we would have to say that the
constituted, reduced to its meaning, here overflows its meaning, be-
comes within constitution the condition of the constituting, or, more
exactly, the nourishment of the constituting. This overflowing of mean-
ing can be fixed by the term alimentation. The surplus over meaning is
not a meaning in its turn, simply thought as a condition-which would
be to reduce the aliment to a correlate represented. The aliment condi-
tions the very thought that would think it as a condition. It is not
that this conditioning is only noticed after the event: the originality of
the situation lies in that the conditioning is produced in the midst of the
relation between representing and represented, constituting and consti-
tuted-a relation which we find first in every case of consciousness.
Eating, for example, is to be sure not reducible to the chemistry of
alimentation. But eating also does not reduce itself to the set of
B. Enjoyment and Representation                      129
gustative, olfactory, kinesthetic, and other sensations that would consti-
tute the consciousness of eating. This sinking one's teeth into the things
which the act of eating involves above all measures the surplus of the re-
ality of the aliment over every represented reality, a surplus that is not
quantitative, but is the way the I, the absolute commencement, is sus-
pended on the non-I. The corporeity of the living being and its indig-
ence as a naked and hungry body is the accomplishment of these struc-
tures ( described in abstract terms as an affirmation of exteriority which is
not a theoretical affirmation, and as a position on the earth which
is not the positing of one mass on another). To be sure, in the
satisfaction of need the alienness of the world that founds me loses its
alterity: in satiety the real I sank my teeth into is assimilated, the forces
that were in the other become my forces, become me (and every satisfac-
tion of need is in some respect nourishment) . Through labor and
possession the alterity of nutriments enters into the same. Yet it remains
true that this relationship differs fundamentally from the inspiration
[genialite] of representation we spoke of above. Here the relation is
reversed, as though the constitutive thought were stimulated by its own
game, by its free play, as though freedom as a present absolute com-
mencement found its condition in its own product, as though this product
did not receive its meaning from a consciousness that ascribes meaning to
being. The body is a permanent contestation of the prerogative attrib-
uted to consciousness of "giving meaning" to each thing; it lives as this
contestation. The world I live in is not simply the counterpart or the
contemporary of thought and its constitutive freedom, but a condition-
ing and an antecedence. The world I constitute nourishes me and
bathes me. It is aliment and "medium" ["milieu"}. The intentionality
aiming at the exterior changes direction in the course of its very aim by
becoming interior to the exteriority it constitutes, somehow comes from
the point to which it goes, recognizing itself past in its future, lives from
what it thinks.
If the intentionality of "living from .•." which is properly en-
joyment is not constitutive, this is therefore not because an elusive,
inconceivable content, inconvertible into a meaning of thought, irreduci-
ble to the present and consequently unrepresentable, would compromise
the universality of representation and the transcendental method; it is
the very movement of constitution that is reversed. It is not the
encounter with the irrational that stops the play of constitution; the play
changes its sense. The body indigent and naked is this very changing
130                        Totality and Infinity
of sense. This is the profound insight Descartes had when he refused to
sense data the status of clear and distinct ideas, ascribed them to the body,
and relegated them to the useful. This is his superiority over Husserlian
phenomenology which puts no limit on noematization. A movement
radically different from thought is manifested when the constitution by
thought finds its condition in what it has freely welcomed or refused,
when the represented turns into a past that had not traversed the pres-
ent of representation, as an absolute past not receiving its meaning from
memory.
The world I live from is not simply constituted at a second level after
representation would have spread before us a backdrop of a reality simply
given, and after "axiological" intentions would have ascribed to this
world a value that renders it apt for habitation. The "turning" of the
constituted into a condition is accomplished as soon as I open my eyes: I
but open my eyes and already enjoy the spectacle. Objectification
proceeding somehow from the center of a thinking being manifests, upon
its contact with the earth, an eccentricity. What the subject contains
represented is also what supports and nourishes its activity as a subject.
The represented, the present, is a fact, already belonging to the past.


3. Element and Things, Implements
But in what does the world of enjoyment resist the effort to describe it
as correlative to representation? Would that universally possible rever-
sal of the lived into the known, which feeds philosophical idealism,
miscarry for enjoyment? In what respect does the sojourn of man in the
world he enjoys remain irreducible and anterior to the knowledge of that
world? Why declare the interiority of man to the world that conditions
him-sustains and contains him? Does not this amount to affirming the
exteriority of the things with respect to man?
In order to answer we have to analyze more closely the way the things
we enjoy come to us. Enjoyment precisely does not reach them qua
things. Things come to representation from a background from which
they emerge and to which they return in the enjoyment we can have of
them.
In enjoyment the things are not absorbed in the technical finality that
organizes them into a system. They take form within a medium
[milieu] in which we take hold of them. They are found in space, in the
air, on the earth, in the street, along the road. The medium remains
B. Enjoyment and Representation                      131
essential to things, even when they refer to property, whose intent we
shall show further, and which constitutes the things qua things. This
medium is not reducible to a system of operational references and is not
equivalent to the totality of such a system, nor to a totality in which
the look or the hand would have the possibility of choosing, a virtuality of
things which choice would each time actualize. The medium has its own
density. Things refer to possession, can be carried off, are furnishings•;
the medium from which they come to me lies escheat, a common fund or
terrain, essentially non-possessable, "nobody's": earth, sea, light, city.
Every relation or possession is situated within the non-possessable which
envelops or contains without being able to be contained or enveloped.
We shall call it the elemental.
The navigator who makes use of the sea and the wind dominates these
elements but does not thereby transform them into things. They re-
tain the indetermination of elements despite the precision of the laws that
govern them, which can be known and taught. The element has no
forms containing it; it is content without form. Or rather it has but a
side: the surface of the sea and of the field, the edge of the wind; the
medium upon which this side** takes form is not composed of things.
It unfolds in its own dimension: depth, which is inconvertible into the
breadth and length in which the side of the element extends. To be sure,
a thing likewise presents itself by but one unique side; but we can circle
round it, and the reverse is equivalent to the obverse; all the points of
view are equivalent. The depth of the element prolongs it till it is lost
in the earth and in the heavi>ns. "Nothing ends, nothing begins."
To tell the truth the element has no side at all. One does not
approach it. The relation adequate to its essence discovers it precisely as
a medium: one is steeped in it; I am always within the element. Man
has overcome the elements only by surmounting this interiority without
issue by the domicile, which confers upon him an extraterritoriality. He
gets a foothold in the elemental by a side already appropriated: a field
cultivated by me, the sea in which I fish and moor my boats, the forest in
which I cut wood; and all these acts, all this labor, refer to the domicile.
Man plunges into the elemental from the domicile, the primary appropri-

• "Meubles." Furnishings are, in French, "moveables"; this root subsists in
the usage Levinas makes of this term.-Trans.
•• "Face"-it is in order to reserve the English word "face" to translate

translate "face" in this context.-Trans.
132                         Totality and Infinity
ation, of which we shall speak further. He is within what he possesses,
such that we shall be able to say that the domicile, condition for all
property, renders the inner life possibe. The I is thus at home with
itself. Through the home our relation with space as distance and
extension is substituted for the simple "bathing in the element." But the
adequate relation with the element is precisely bathing. The interiority
of immersion is not convertible into exteriority. The pure quality of the
element does not cling to a substance that would support it. To bathe in
the element is to be in an inside-out world, and here the reverse is not
equivalent to the obverse. A thing offers itself to us by its side, as a
solicitation coming from its substantiality, from a solidity ( already sus-
pended by possession). We can, to be sure, represent the liquid or the
gaseous to ourselves as a multiplicity of solids, but we then are abstract-
ing from our presence in the midst of the element. The liquid manifests
its liquidity, its qualities without support, its adjectives without substan-
tive, to the immersion of the bather. The element presents us as it were
the reverse of reality, without origin in a being, although presenting
itself in familiarity--of enjoyment-as though we were in the bowels of
being. Hence we can say that the element comes to us from nowhere;
the side it presents to us does not determine an object, remains entirely
anonymous. It is wind, earth, sea, sky, air.• Indetermination here is
not equivalent to the infinite surpassing limits; it precedes the distinction
between the finite and the infinite. It is not a quesion of a something,
an existent manifesting itself as refractory to qualitative determination.
Quality manifests itself in the element as determining nothing.
Thus thought does not fix the element as an object. As pure quality it
lies outside the distinction between the finite and the infinite. The
question what is the "other side" of what offers us one side does not arise
in the relation maintained with the element. The sky, the earth, the sea,
the wind-suffice to themselves. The element as it were stops up the
infinite by relation to which it should have had to have been thought, and
by relation to which scientific thought, which has received from else-
where the idea of infinity, does in fact situate it. The element separates
us from the infinite.
Every object offers itself to enjoyment, a universal category of the


• "Wind" designates neither a singular object nor a plurality; the partitive
construction renders this in the French: "C'est du vent, de la terre, de la mer,
du ciel, de l'air."-Trans.
B. Enjoyment and Representation                    133
empirical-even if I lay hold of an object-implement, if I handle it as a
Zeug. The handling and utilization of tools, the recourse to all the
instrumental gear of a life, whether to fabricate other tools or to render
things accessible, concludes in enjoyment. As material or gear the
objects of everyday use are subordinated to enjoyment-the lighter to the
cigarette one smokes, the fork to the food, the cup to the lips. Things
refer to my enjoyment. This is an observation as commonplace as could
be, which the analyses of Zeughaftigkeit do not succeed in effacing.
Possession itself and all the relations with abstract notions are inverted
into enjoyment. Pushkin's greedy knight enjoys possessing the possession
of the world.
Enjoyment-an ultimate relation with the substantial plenitude of
being, with its materiality-embraces all relations with things. The
structure of the Zeug as Zeug and the system of references in which it
has its place do indeed manifest themselves, in concerned handling, as
irreducible to vision, but do not encompass the substantiality of objects,
which is always there in addition. Moreover furnishings, the home,
food, clothing are not Zeuge in the proper sense of the term: cloth-
ing serves to protect the body or to adorn it, the home to shelter it,
food to restore it, but we enjoy them or suffer from them; they are
ends. Tools themselves, which are-in-view-of . . . , become objects of
enjoyment. The enjoyment of a thing, be it a tool, does not consist
simply in bringing this thing to the usage for which it is fabricated-the
pen to the writing, the hammer to the nail to be driven in-but also in
suffering or rejoicing over this operation. The things that are not tools
-the crust of bread, the flame in the fireplace, the cigarette--offer them-
selves to enjoyment. But this enjoyment accompanies every utilization
of things, even in a complex enterprise where the end of a labor alone
absorbs the research. The utilization of a thing in view of . . . , this
reference to the whole, remains on the level of its attributes. One can
like one's job, enjoy these material gestures and the things that permit
the accomplishing of them. One can transform the curse of labor into
sport. Activity does not derive its meaning and its value from an
ultimate and unique goal, as though the world formed one system of use-
references whose term touches our very existence. The world answers
to a set of autonomous finalities which ignore one another. To enjoy
without utility, in pure loss, gratuitously, without referring to anything
else, in pure expenditure-this is the human. There is a non-systematic
accumulation of occupations and tastes, equidistant from the system of
134                        Totality and Infinity
reason, where the encounter with the Other opens the infinite, and from
the system of the instinct, anterior to separated being, anterior to the
being veritably born, separated from its cause, nature.
Will it be said that this accumulation has as its condition the appercep-
tion of utility, reducible to the care for existence? But the care for
nutriments is not bound to a care for existence. The inversion of the
instincts of nutrition, which have lost their biological finality, marks
the very disinterestedness of man. The suspension or absence of the ulti-
mate finality has a positive face-the disinterested joy of play. To live is
to play, despite the finality and tension of instinct to live from some-
thing without this something having the sense of a goal or an ontological
means-simply play or enjoyment of life. It is carefreeness with regard
to existence, which has a positive meaning: it consists in sinking one's
teeth fully into the nutriments of the world, agreeing to [agreer] the
world as wealth, releasing its elemental essence. In enjoyment the
things revert to their elemental qualities. Enjoyment, the sensibility
( whose essence it exhibits), is produced as a possibility of being precisely
by ignoring the prolongation of hunger into the concern for self-preserva-
tion. Here lies the permanent truth of hedonist moralities: to not seek,
behind the satisfaction of need, an order relative to which alone satisfac-
tion would acquire a value; to take satisfaction, which is the very
meaning of pleasure, as a term. The need for food does not have
existence as its goal, but food. Biology teaches the prolongation of
nourishment into existence; need is naive. In enjoyment I am absolutely
for myself. Egoist without reference to the Other, I am alone without
solitude, innocently egoist and alone. Not against the Others, not "as
for me . . . "-but entirely deaf to the Other, outside of all communica-
tion and all refusal to communicate-without ears, like a hungry stom-
ach.
The world as a set of implements forming a system and suspended on
the care of an existence anxious for its being interpreted as an onto-logy,
attests labor, habitation, the home, and economy; but in addition, it bears
witness to a particular organization of labor in which "foods" take on the
signification of fuel in the economic machinery. It is interesting to ob-
serve that Heidegger does not take the relation of enjoyment into con-
sideration. The implement has entirely masked the usage and the
issuance at the term-the satisfaction. Dasein in Heidegger is never
hungry. Food can be interpreted as an implement only in a world of
exploitation.

4. Sensibility
But to posit the element as a quality without substance does not
amount to admitting the existence of a mutilated or still stammering
"thought" correlative of such phenomena. To-be-in-the-element does
indeed disengage a being from blind and deaf participation in a whole,
but differs from a thought making its way outward. Here on the
contrary the movement comes incessantly upon me, as the wave that
engulfs and submerges and drowns-an incessant movement of affiux
without respite, a total contact without fissure nor gap from which the
reflected movement of a thought could arise. It is to be within, to be
inside of. • . • This situation is not reducible to a representation, not
even an inarticulate representation; it belongs to sensibility, which is the
mode of enjoyment. It is when sensibility is interpreted as representa-
tion and mutilated thought that the finitude of our thought has to be
invoked so as to account for these "obscure" thoughts. The sensibility we
are describing starting with enjoyment of the element does not belong
to the order of thought but to that of sentiment, that is, the affectivity
wherein the egoism of the I pulsates. One does not know, one lives
sensible qualities: the green of these leaves, the red of this sunset. Ob-
jects content me in their finitude, without appearing to me on a ground
of infinity. The finite without the infinite is possible only as content-
ment. The finite as contentment is sensibility. Sensibility does not
constitute the world, because the world called sensible does not have as
its function to constitute a representation-but constitutes the very con-
tentment of existence, because its rational insufficiency does not even
appear in the enjoyment it procures me. To sense is to be within, with-
out the conditioned, and consequently of itself inconsistent, character
of this ambience, which troubles rational thought, being in any way in-
cluded in the sensation. Sensibility, essentially naive, suffices to itself
in a world insufficient for thought. The objects of the world, which
for thought lie in the void, for sensibility-or for life-spread forth on
a horizon which entirely hides that void. The sensibility touches the
reverse, without wondering about the obverse; this is produced precisely
in contentment.
The profundity of the Cartesian philosophy of the sensible consists, we
have said, in affirming the irrational character of sensation, an idea
forever without clarity or distinctness, belonging to the order of the
useful and not of the true. The strength of the Kantian philosophy of
136                        Totality and Infinity
the sensible likewise consists in separating sensibility and understanding,
in affirming, though only negatively, the independence of the "matter"
of cognition with regard to the synthetic power of representation. In
postulating things in themselves so as to avoid the absurdity of ap-
paritions without there being anything that is appearing, Kant does in-
deed go beyond the phenomenology of the sensible. But at least he does
recognize thereby that of itself the sensible is an apparition without
there being anything that appears.
Sensibility establishes a relation with a pure quality without support,
with the element. Sensibility is enjoyment. The sensitive being, the
body, concretizes this way of being, which consists in finding a condition
in what, in other respects, can appear as an object of thought, as simply
constituted.
The sensibility is therefore to be described not as a moment of
representation, but as the instance of enjoyment. Its intention ( if we
may resort to this term) does not go in the direction of representation.
It does not suffice to say that sensation lacks clarity and distinctness, as
though it were situated on the plane of representation. Sensibility is
not an inferior theoretical knowledge bound however intimately to affec-
tive states: in its very gnosis sensibility is enjoyment; it is satisfied
with the given, it is contented. Sensible "knowledge" does not have to
surmount infinite regression, that vertigo of the understanding; it does
not even experience it. It finds itself immediately at the term; it con-
cludes, it finishes without referring to the infinite. Finition* without
reference to the infinite, finition without limitation, is the relation
with the end [fin] as a goal. The sense datum with which sensibility
is nourished always comes to gratify a need, responds to a tendency. It
is not that at the beginning there was hunger; the simultaneity of hunger
and food constitutes the paradisal initial condition of enjoyment. Thus
the Platonic theory of negative pleasures confines itself to the formal
pattern of enjoyment only, and fails to recognize the originality of a
structure which does not show through in the formal, but concretely
weaves the living from. . . . An existence that has this mode is the
body-both separated from its end ( that is, need), but already pro-
ceeding toward that end without having to know .the means necessary
for its obtainment, an action released by the end, accomplished without
knowledge of means, that is, without tools. Pure finality, irreducible to

• "Finition." We retain this form, to correspond with the form "infinition"
introduced earlier (cf. p. xiii).-Trans.
B. Enjoyment and Representation                   137
a result, is produced only by corporeal action ignorant of the mechanism
of its own physiology. But the body is not only what is steeped in the
element, but what dwells, that is, inhabits and possesses. In sensibility
itself and independently of all thought there is announced an insecu-
rity which throws back in question this quasi-eternal immemoriality of
the element, which will disturb it as the other, and which it will ap-
propriate by recollecting [se recueillant] in a dwelling.
Enjoyment seems to be in touch with an "other" inasmuch as a future
is announced within the element and menaces it with insecurity. We
will speak further of this insecurity belonging to the order of enjoy-
ment; for the moment what is important for us is to show that sen-
sibility is of the order of enjoyment and not of the order of experience.
Sensibility thus understood is not to be confused with still vacillat-
ing forms of "consciousness of." It is not separated from thought
by a simple difference of degree, nor even by a difference in the nobility or
the extent of expansion of their objects. Sensibility does not aim at
an object, however rudimentary. It concerns even the elaborated forms
of consciousness, but its proper work consists in enjoyment, through
which every object is dissolved into the element in which enjoyment is
steeped. For in fact the sensible objects we enjoy have already undergone
labor. The sensible quality already clings to a substance. And we shall
have to analyze further the signification of the sensible object qua thing.
But contentment, in its naivete, lurks behind the relation with things.
This earth upon which I find myself and from which I welcome sensible
objects or make my way to them suffices for me. The earth which
upholds me does so without my troubling myself about knowing what
upholds the earth. I am content with the aspect this corner of the world,
universe of my daily behavior, this city or this neighborhood or this street
in which I move, this horizon within which I live, turn to me; I do not
ground them in a more vast system. It is they that ground me. I
welcome them without thinking them. I enjoy this world of things as
pure elements, as qualities without support, without substance.
But does not this "for me" presuppose a representation of oneself in
the idealist sense of the term? The world is for me-this does not mean
that I represent the world to myself as being for me, and represent this
me in its turn to myself. This relation of myself with myself is
accomplished when I stand [me tiens]* in the world which precedes me
as an absolute of an unrepresentable antiquity. To be sure, I cannot

• Cf. p. 37, note.
138                        Totality and Infinity
think the horizon in which I find myself to be an absolute, but I stand in
it as in an absolute. Standing there is precisely different from "think-
ing." The bit of earth that supports me is not only my object; it
supports my experience of objects. Well-trampled places do not resist
me but support me. The relation with my site in this "stance"
["tenue"] precedes thought and labor. The body, position, the fact of
standing-patterns of the primary relation with myself, of my coinci-
dence with myself-nowise resemble idealist representation. I am my-
self, I am here, at home with myself, inhabitation, immanence in the
world. My sensibility is here. In my position there is not the sentiment
of localization, but the localization of my sensibility. Position, abso-
lutely without transcendence, does not resemble the comprehension of the
world by the Heideggerian Da. It is not a care for Being, nor a relation
with existents, nor even a negation of the world, but its accessibility in
enjoyment. Sensibility is the very narrowness of life, the naviete of the
unreflected I, beyond instinct, beneath reason.
But does not the "side of things" offered as an element refer implicitly
to the other side? Implicitly, to be sure. And in the eyes of reason the
contentment of sensibility is ridiculous. But sensibility is not a blind
reason and folly. It is prior to reason; the sensible is not to be ascribed
to the totality to which it is closed. Sensibility enacts the very separation
of being-separated and independent. The aptitude to keep [se tenir]
to the immediate is not reducible to anything else; it does not
signify the lapse of the power that would dialectically render explicit
the presuppositions of the immediate, set them in movement, and
suppress them in sublimating them. Sensibility is not a thought unaware
of itself. To pass from the implicit to the explicit a master who evokes
attention is necessary. To evoke attention is not a subsidiary work; in
attention the I transcends itself. But a relation with the exteriority of
the master was necessary to engage attention. Explicitation presupposes
this transcendence.
The limitation of contentment without reference to the unlimited
precedes the distinction between the finite and the infinite such as it is
incumbent upon thought. The descriptions of contemporary psychology
that make of sensation an islet that emerges from an obscure viscous
ground of the unconscious-relative to which the consciousness of the sen-
sible would already have lost its sincerity-fail to recognize the funda-
mental and irreducible self-sufficience of sensibility, due to its keeping
[se tenir] within its horizon. To sense is precisely to be sincerely con-

tent with what is sensed, to enjoy, to refuse the unconscious prolonga-
tions, to be thoughtless, that is, without ulterior motives,• unequivocal,
to break with all the implications-to maintain oneself at home with
oneself. Torn up from all the implications, from all the prolongations
thought offers, all the instants of our life can reach completion, precisely
because life dispenses with the intellectual search for the unconditioned.
To reflect on each of one's acts is, to be sure, to situate them with respect
to infinity, but the unreflected and naive consciousness constitutes the
originality of enjoyment. The naivete of consciousness was described
as a torpid thought, but from this somnolence thought can nowise be
extracted. It is life, in the sense that we speak of relishing life. We
en joy the world before referring to its prolongations; we breathe, walk,
see, stroll, . . . •
The description of enjoyment as it has been conducted to this point
assuredly does not render the concrete man. In reality man has already
the idea of infinity, that is, lives in society and represents things to
himself. The separation accomplished as enjoyment, that is, as interior-
ity, becomes a consciousness of objects. The things are fixed by the word
which gives them, which communicates them and thematizes them. And
the new fixity things acquire due to language presupposes much more
than the adjunction of a sound to a thing. Over and above enjoyment
-with dwelling, possession, the making common-a discourse about the
world takes form. Appropriation and representation add a new event to
enjoyment. They are founded on language as a relation among men.
Things have a name and an identity. Transformations occur to things
which remain the same: the stone crumbles but remains the same stone;
I rediscover my pen and armchair the same; it is in the selfsame palace of
Louis XIV that the Treaty of Versailles was signed ; the same train
is the train that leaves at the same hour. The world of perception is
thus a world where things have identity. The subsistance of this world
is visibly possible only through memory. The identity of persons and the
continuity of their labors project over the things the grill through which
they find again identical things. An earth inhabited by men endowed
with language is peopled with stable things.
But this identity of things remains unstable and does not close off the
return of things to the element. A thing exists in the midst of its
wastes. When the kindling wood becomes smoke and ashes the identity

• " . . . etre sans pens~e, c'est i dire sans arrihe-pens~es , .."
140                        Totality and Infinity
of my table disappears. The wastes become indiscernible ; the smoke
drifts off anywhere. If my thought follows the transformation of things
I lose the trace of their identity very quickly-as soon as they quit their
container. Descartes's reasoning about the piece of wax indicates the
itinerary by which each thing loses its identity. In things the distinction
between matter and form is essential, as also the dissolution of form in
the matter. It imposes a quantitative physics in place of the world of
perception.
The distinction between form and matter does not characterize all
experience. The face has no form added to it, but does not present
itself as the formless, as matter that lacks and calls for form. Things
have a form, are seen in the light-silhouettes or profiles; the face signifies
itself. As silhouette and profile a thing owes its nature to a perspec-
tive, remains relative to a point of view; a thing's situation thus
constitutes its being. Strictly speaking it has no identity; convertible
into another thing, it can become money. Things have no face; converti-
ble, "realizable," they have a price. They represent money because they
are of elemental nature, are wealth. Their rootedness in the elemental,
their accessibility to physics, and their signification as tools are thus
confirmed. The aesthetic orientation man gives to the whole of his
world represents a return to enjoyment and to the elemental on a higher
plane. The world of things calls for art, in which intellectual ac-
cession to being moves into enjoyment, in which the Infinity of the idea is
idolized in the finite, but sufficient, image. All art is plastic. Tools and
implements, which themselves presuppose enjoyment, offer themselves to
enjoyment in their turn. They are playthings [jouets]: the fine ciga-
rette lighter, the fine car. They are adorned by the decorative arts; they
are immersed in the beautiful, where every going beyond enjoyment
reverts to enjoyment.

5. The Mythical Format of the Element
The sensible world, overflowing the freedom of representation, does
not betoken the failure of freedom, but the enjoyment of a world, a world
"for me," which already contents me. The elements do not receive man
as a land of exile, humiliating and limiting his freedom. The human
being does not find himself in an absurd world in which he would be
geworfen. And this is true absolutely. The disquietude that manifests
itself within the enjoyment of the element, in the overflowing of the
B. Enjoyment and Representation                      141
instant that escapes the gentle mastery of enjoyment, is, we shall see fur-
ther, recouped by labor. Labor recoups the lag between the element and
the sensation.
But this overflowing of sensation by the element, which appears in the
indetermination with which it offers itself to my enjoyment, takes on a
temporal meaning. In enjoyment quality is not a quality of something.
The solidity of the earth that supports me, the blue of the sky above my
head, the breath of the wind, the undulation of the sea, the sparkle of the
light do not cling to a substance. They come from nowhere. This
coming from nowhere, from "something" that is not, appearing with-
out there being anything that appears-and consequently coming always,
without my being able to possess the source--delineates the future of
sensibility and enjoyment. This is not yet a representation of the
future, in which the threat allows for respite and liberation. By repre-
sentation the enjoyment that has recourse to labor becomes again
absolutely mistress of the world, interiorizing it with respect to its
dwelling. The future, as insecurity, is already in the pure quality which
lacks the category of substance, of something. It is not that the source
escapes me in fact: in enjoyment quality is lost in the nowhere. It
is the apeiron distinct from the infinite, and which, by contrast with
things, presents itself as a quality refractory to identification. Quality
does not withstand identification because it would represent a flux and a
duration; rather its elemental character, its coming forth from nothing,
constitutes its fragility, the disintegration of becoming, that time prior to
representation-which is menace and destruction.
The element suits me--1 enjoy it; the need to which it responds is the
very mode of this conformity or of this happiness. The indetermination
of the future alone brings insecurity to need, indigence: the perfidious
elemental gives itself while escaping. Hence it is not the relation of need
with a radical alterity that would indicate the non-freedom of need.
The resistance of matter does not block like the absolute. As a resistance
already overcome, open to labor, it opens up an abyss within enjoyment
itself. Enjoyment does not refer to an infinity beyond what nourishes it,
but to the virtual vanishing of what presents itself, to the instability of
happiness. Nourishment comes as a happy chance. This ambivalence of
nourishment, which on the one hand offers itself and contents, but which
already withdraws, losing itself in the nowhere, is to be distinguished
from the presence of the infinite in the finite and from the structure of
the thing.
142                             Totality and I n/inity
This coming forth from nowhere opposes the element to what we will
describe under the name of face [visage], where precisely an existent
presents itself personally. To be affected by a side [face] of being while
its whole depth remains undetermined and comes upon me from nowhere
is to be bent toward the insecurity of the morrow. The future of the
element as insecurity is lived concretely as the mythical divinity of the
element. Faceless gods, impersonal gods to whom one does not speak,
mark the nothingness that bounds the egoism of enjoyment in the midst
of its familiarity with the element. But it is thus that enjoyment
accomplishes separation. The separated being must run the risk of the
paganism which evinces its separation and in which this separation is
accomplished, until the moment that the death of these gods will lead it
back to atheism and to the true transcendence.
The nothingness of the future ensures separation: the element we
enjoy issues in the nothingness which separates. The element I inhabit is
at the frontier of a night. What the side of the element that is turned
toward me conceals is not a "something" susceptible of being revealed,
but an ever-new depth of absence, an existence without existeni:, the
impersonal par excellence. This way of existing without revealing itself,
outside of being and the world, must be called mythical. The nocturnal
prolongation of the element is the reign of mythical gods. Enjoyment
is without security. But this future does not take on the character of a
Geworfenheit, for insecurity menaces an enjoyment already happy
in the element, rendered sensitive to disquietude only by this happiness.
We have described this nocturnal dimension of the future under the
title there is.* The element extends into the there is. Enjoyment, as
interiorization, runs up against the very strangeness of the earth.
But it has the recourse of labor and possession.

## C. I And Dependence


1. Joy and Its Morrows
The movement to self in enjoyment and happiness marks the suffi-
ciency of the I, although the image we have used of the spiral that coils
over itself does not enable us to depict also the enrootedness of this suf-
ficiency in the insufficiency of living from. • • • The I is, to be sure,
happiness, presence at home with itself. But, as sufficiency in its non-suf-
ficiency, it remains in the non-I; it is enjoyment of "something else,"
never of itself. Autochthonous, that is, enrooted in what it is not, it is
nevertheless, within this enrootedness, independent and separated. The
relationship of the I with the non-I produced as happiness which promotes
the I consists neither in assuming nor in refusing the non-I. Between the
I and what it lives from there does not extend the absolute distance
that separates the same from the other. The acceptance or refusal of
what we live from implies a prior agreement [agrement]*, both given
and received, the agreement of happiness. The primary agreement, to
live, does not alienate the I but maintains it, constitutes its being at home
with itself. The dwelling, inhabitation, belongs to the essence-to the
egoism--of the I. Against the anonymous there is, horror, trembling,
and vertigo, perturbation of the I that does not coincide with itself,
the happiness of enjoyment affirms the I at home with itself. But if,
in the relation with the non-I of the world it inhabits, the I is produced
as self-sufficiency and is maintained in an instant torn up from the con-
tinuity of time, dispensed from assuming or refusing a past, it does not
benefit from this dispensation by virtue of a privilege enjoyed from
eternity. The veritable position of the I in time consists in interrupting
time by punctuating it with beginnings. This is produced in the form of
action. Commencement within a continuity is possible only as action.
But time, in which the I can commence its action, portends the !ability of
its independence. The uncertainties of the future that mar happiness
• To be taken in the double sense of "assent" and also "agreeableness" or
pleasure.-Trans
143
144                       Totality and Infinity
remind enjoyment that its independence envelops a dependence.
Happiness does not succeed in dissimulating this fault in its sovereignty
-which is exposed as "subjective," "psychic," and "merely inward."
The reversion of all the modes of being to the I, to the inevitable
subjectivity constituting itself in the happiness of enjoyment, does not
institute an absolute subjectivity, independent of the non-I. The non-I
feeds enjoyment; the I needs the world, which exalts it. The freedom
of enjoyment thus is experienced as limited. Limitation is not due
to the fact that the I has not chosen its birth and thus is already and
henceforth in situation, but to the fact that the plenitude of its in-
stant of enjoyment is not ensured against the unknown that lurks in the
very element it enjoys, the fact that joy remains a chance and a stroke of
luck. The fact that enjoyment would be but a void that fills can nowise
throw suspicion on the qualitative plenitude of enjoyment. Enjoyment
and happiness are not calculated by the quantities of being and nothing-
ness which compensate or fail to compensate for one another; enjoyment
is an exaltation, a peak that exceeds the pure exercise of being. But the
happiness of enjoyment, a satisfaction of needs which is not compromised
by the need-satisfaction rhythm, can be tarnished by the concern for the
morrow involved in the fathomless depth of the element in which
enjoyment is steeped. The happiness of enjoyment flourishes on the
"pain" of need and thus depends on an "other"; it is a stroke of good
fortune, a chance. But this conjuncture justifies neither the denuncia-
tion of pleasure as illusory nor the characterizing of man in the world as
dereliction. The indigence that menaces living as living from . . .-
because what life lives from can come to be wanting-cannot be con-
founded with the void of appetite already settled in enjoyment, which in
satisfaction makes possible, beyond simple being, its jubilation. On the
other hand, the "pain" of need nowise evinces an alleged irrationality of
the sensible, as though the sensible offended the autonomy of the rational
person. In the pain of needs reason does not revolt against the scandal of
a given pre-existing freedom. For one cannot first posit an I and then
ask if enjoyment and need run counter to it, limit it, injure it, or negate
it: only in enjoyment does the I crystallize.


2. The Love of Life
At the origin there is a being gratified, a c1t1zen of paradise. The
"emptiness" felt implies that the need which becomes aware of it abides
C. I and Dependence                            14S
already in the midst of an enjoyment-be it that of the air one breathes.
It anticipates the joy of satisfaction, which is better than ataraxy. Far
from putting the sensible life into question, pain takes place within its
horizons and refers to the joy of living. Already and henceforth life is
loved. The I can, to be sure, revolt against the givens of its situation,
for it does not lose itself in living at home, and remains distinct from
what it lives from. But this interval between the I and what nourishes
it does not allow of the negation of nourishment as such. If in this
interval an opposition can come into play, it is maintained within the
limits of the very situation it refuses and from which it is nourished.
Every opposition to life takes refuge in life and refers to its values. This
is the love of life, a pre-established harmony with what is yet to come to
us.
The love of life does not resemble the care for Being, reducible to the
comprehension of Being, or ontology. The love of life does not love
Being, but loves the happiness of being. Life loved is the very enjoyment
of life, contentment-already appreciated in the refusal I bear against it,
where contentment is refused in the name of contentment itself. The
love of life, a relation of life with life, is neither a representation of life
nor a reflection on life. The lag between me and my joy does not leave
room for a total refusal. There is in revolt no radical refusal, just as in
life's joyous access to life there is no assumption. The famous passivity
of feeling is such that it leaves no play for the movement of a freedom
that would assume it. The gnosis of the sensible is already enjoyment.
What one might be tempted to present as negated or consumed in
enjoyment is not affirmed for itself, but is given from the first.
Enjoyment reaches a world that has neither secrecy nor veritable foreign-
ness. The primordial positivity of enjoyment, perfectly innocent, is
opposed to nothing and in this sense suffices to itself from the first. An
instant or a standstill, it is the success of the carpe diem, the sovereignty
of the "after us the deluge." These pretensions would be pure nonsense
and not eternal temptations could not enjoyment tear itself absolutely
from the disintegration characteristic of duration.
Need therefore can be characterized neither as freedom, since it is
dependence, nor as passivity, since it lives from what, already familiar
and without secret, does not subjugate it but gladdens it. The philoso-
phers of existence who emphasize dereliction misconstrue the opposition
arising between the I and its joy-an opposition due to the disquietude
that insinuates itself into enjoyment, menaced with the indetermination of
146                        Totality and Infinity
the future essential to sensibility, or due to the pain inherent in labor.
Being is here nowise refused in its totality. In its opposition to being the
I seeks refuge in being itself. Suicide is tragic, for death does not bring a
resolution to all the problems to which birth gave rise, and is powerless to
humiliate the values of the earth-whence Macbeth's final cry in con-
fronting death, defeated because the universe is not destroyed at the same
time as his life. Suffering at the same time despairs for being riveted to
being-and loves the being to which it is riveted. It knows the impossi-
bility of quitting life: what tragedy! what comedy . . • The taedium
vitae is steeped in the love of the life it rejects; despair does not break
with the ideal of joy. In reality this pessimism has an economic infra-
structure; it expresses the anxiety for the morrow and the pain of labor,
whose role in metaphysical desire we shall show later. The Marxist
views retain here their whole force, even in a different perspective. The
suffering of need is not assuaged in anorexy, but in satisfaction. Need is
loved; man is happy to have needs. A being without needs would not be
happier than a needy being, but outside of happiness and unhappiness.
That indigence could mark the pleasure of satisfaction, that instead of
possessing plenitude pure and simple we would reach enjoyment
through need and labor-this conjuncture is due to the very structure
of separation. The separation that is accomplished by egoism would
be but a word if the ego, the separated and self-sufficient being, did not
hear the muffied rustling of nothingness back unto which the elements
flow and are lost.
Labor can surmount the indigence with which not need, but the
uncertainty of the future affects being.
The nothingness of the future, we shall see, turns into an interval of
time in which possession and labor are inserted. The passage from
instantaneous enjoyment to the fabrication of things refers to habitation,
to economy, which presupposes the welcoming of the Other. The
pessimism of dereliction is hence not irremediable-man holds in his
hands the remedy for his ills, and the remedies preexist the ills.
But labor itself, by virtue of which I live freely, ensuring myself
against life's uncertainty, does not bring life its final signification. It
also becomes that from which I live. I live from the whole content of
life-even from the labor which ensures the future; I live from my
labor as I live from air, light, and bread. The limit case in which need
prevails over enjoyment, the proletarian condition condemning to ac-
cursed labor in which the indigence of corporeal existence finds neither
C. land Dependence                            147
refuge nor leisure at home with itself, is the absurd world of Geworfen-
heit.


3. Enjoyment and Separation
In enjoyment throbs egoist being. Enjoyment separates by engaging
in the contents from which it lives. Separation comes to pass as the
positive work of this engagement; it does not result from a simple split,
like a spatial removal. To be separated is to be at home with oneself.
But to be at home with oneself . . . is to live from . . . , to enjoy the
elemental. The "failure" of the constitution of the objects from which
one lives is not due to the irrationality or the obscurity of those objects,
but to their function as nutriments. Food is not unrepresentable; it
subtends its own representation, but in it the I again finds itself. The
ambiguity of a constitution in which the world represented conditions the
act of representing is the way of being of him who is not simply posited
but posits himself. The absolute void, the "nowhere" in which the
element loses itself and from which it arises, on all sides beats against the
islet of the I who lives interiorly. The interiority which enjoyment
opens up is not added as an attribute to the subject "endowed" with
conscious life, as one psychological property among others. The interior-
ity of enjoyment is separation in itself, is the mode according to which
such an event as separation can be produced in the economy of being.
Happiness is a principle of individuation, but individuation in itself is
conceivable only from within, through interiority. In the happiness of
enjoyment is enacted the individuation, the auto-personification, the sub-
stantialization, and the independence of the self, a forgetting of the
infinite depths of the past and the instinct that resumes them.
Enjoyment is the very production of a being that is born, that breaks the
tranquil eternity of its seminal or uterine existence to enclose itself in a
person, who in living from the world lives at home with itself. The
incessant turning of ecstatic representation into enjoyment, which we
have brought to light, in each instant restores the antecedence of what I
constitute to this very constitution. It is the living and lived past, not in
the sense we thus speak of a very vivid or close memory, nor even a past
that marks us and has a hold on us and thereby subjugates us, but a past
that founds what separates and frees itself from that past. This libera-
tion flashes in the light of happiness, in separation. Its free flight and
its grace are felt-and are produced-as the very ease of good time. It is
148                        Totality and Infinity
freedom referring to happiness, made of happiness, and consequently
compatible with a being that is not causa sui, that is created.
We have sought to elaborate the notion of enjoyment in which the I
arises and pulsates: we have not determined the I by freedom. Freedom
as the possibility of commencement, referring to happiness, to the marvel
of the good time standing out from the continuity of the hours, is the
production of the I and not one experience among others that "happens"
to the I. Separation and atheism, these negative notions, are pro-
duced by positive events. To be I, atheist, at home with oneself,
separated, happy, created-these are synonyms.
Egoism, enjoyment, sensibility, and the whole dimension of interiority
-the articulations of separation-are necessary for the idea of Infinity,
the relation with the Other which opens forth from the separated and
finite being. Metaphysical Desire, which can be produced only in a
separated, that is, en joying, egoist, and satisfied being, is then not
derived from enjoyment. But if the separated, that is, sentient being
is necessary for the production of infinity and exteriority in meta-
physics, its constitution as thesis or as antithesis, within a dialectical
play, would destroy this exteriority. The infinite does not raise up
the finite by opposition. Just as the interiority of enjoyment is not
deducible from the transcendental relation, the transcendental relation is
not deducible from the separated being as a dialectical antithesis forming
a counterpart to the subjectivity, as union forms the counterpart of
distinction among two terms of any relation. The movement of separa-
tion is not on the same plane as the movement of transcendence. We are
outside of the dialectical conciliation of the I and the non-I, in the
eternal sphere proper to representation ( or in the identity of the I).
Neither the separated being nor the infinite being is produced as an
antithetical term. The interiority that ensures separation (but not as an
abstract rejoinder to the notion of relation) must produce a being
absolutely closed over upon itself, not deriving its isolation dialectically
from its opposition to the Other. And this closedness must not prevent
egress from interiority, so that exteriority could speak to it, reveal itself
to it, in an unforeseeable movement which the isolation of the separated
being could not provoke by simple contrast. In the separated being the
door to the outside must hence be at the same time open and closed. The
closedness of the separated being must be ambiguous enough for, on the
one hand, the interiority necessary to the idea of infinity to remain real
and not apparent only, for the destiny of the interior being to be pursued
C.1 and Dependence                             149
in an egoist atheism refuted by nothing exterior, for it to be pursued
without, in each of the movements of descent into interiority, the being
descending into itself referring to exteriority by a pure play of the
dialectic and in the form of an abstract correlation. But on the other
hand within the flery interiority hollowed out by enjoyment there must
be produced a heteronomy that incites to another destiny than this animal
complacency in oneself. If the dimension of interiority cannot belie its
interiority by the apparition of a heterogeneous element in the course of
this descent into itself along the path of pleasure ( a descent which in fact
first hollows out this dimension), still in this descent a shock must be
produced which, without inverting the movement of interiorization,
without breaking the thread of the interior substance, would furnish the
occasion for a resumption of relations with exteriority. Interiority must
be at the same time closed and open. The possibility of rising from the
animal condition is assuredly thus described.
To this singular requirement enjoyment does indeed answer, by the
insecurity troubling its fundamental security. This insecurity is not due
to the heterogeneity of the world with respect to enjoyment, which
would allegedly bring the sovereignty of the I to naught. The happiness
of enjoyment is stronger than every disquietude, but disquietude can
trouble it; here lies the gap between the animal and the human. The
happiness of enjoyment is greater than all disquietude: whatever be
the concerns for the morrow, the happiness of living--of breathing,
of seeing, of feeling ("One minute more, Mr. Hangman !")-remains in
the midst of disquietude as the term proposed to every evasion from the
world troubled, to intolerability, by disquietude. One 'flees life toward
life. Suicide appears as a possibility to a being already in relation with
the Other, already elevated to life for the Other. It is the possibility of
an existence already metaphysical; only a being already capable of sacri-
fice is capable of suicide. Before defining man as the animal that can
commit suicide it is necessary to define him as capable of living for the
Other and of being on the basis of the Other who is exterior to him. But
the tragic character of suicide and of sacrifice evinces the radicality of the
love of life. The primordial relation of man with the material world is
not negativity, but enjoyment and agreeableness [agrement]• of life. It
is uniquely with reference to this agreeableness-unsurpassable within
• In this term Levinas understands the form of acceptance involved in pleas-
ure. Pleasure, the agreeable, is also what we agree to, and this very "agreeing
to" is itself pleasurable.-Trans.
150                        Totality and Infinity
interiority, for it constitutes it-that the world can appear hostile, to be
negated and to be conquered. If the insecurity of the world that is fully
agreed to in enjoyment troubles enjoyment, the insecurity can not sup-
press the fundamental agreeableness of life. But this insecurity brings
into the interiority of enjoyment a frontier that comes neither from the
revelation of the Other nor from any heterogeneous content, but some-
how from nothingness. It is due to the way the element, in which the
separated being contents itself and suffices to itself, comes to this being-
due to the mythological depth which prolongs the element and into which
the element loses itself. This insecurity, which thus delineates a margin
of nothingness about the interior life, confirming its insularity, is lived in
the instant of enjoyment as the concern for the morrow.
But thus in interiority a dimension opens through which it will be able
to await and welcome the revelation of transcendence. In the concern
for the morrow there dawns the primordial phenomenon of the essen-
tially uncertain future of sensibility. In order that this future arise
in its signification as a postponement and a delay in which labor, by
mastering the uncertainty of the future and its insecurity and by estab-
lishing possession, delineates separation in the form of economic inde-
pendence, the separated being must be able to recollect itself [se recueil-
lir] and have representations. Recollection and representation are pro-
duced concretely as habitation in a dwelling or a Home. But the
interiority of the home is made of extraterritoriality in the midst of the
elements of enjoyment with which life is nourished. This extraterrito-
riality has a positive side. It is produced in the gentleness [ douceur] or
the warmth of intimacy, which is not a subjective state of mind, but an
event in the oecumenia of being-a delightful "lapse" of the ontological
order. By virtue of its intentional structure gentleness comes to the
separated being from the Other. The Other precisely reveals himself in
his alterity not in a shock negating the I, but as the primordial phenome-
non of gentleness.
The whole of this work aims to show a relation with the other not only
cutting across the logic of contradiction, where the other of A is the
non-A, the negation of A, but also across dialectical logic, where the same
dialectically participates in and is reconciled with the other in the Unity
of the system. The welcoming of the face is peaceable from the first, for
it answers to the unquenchable Desire for Infinity. War itself is but a
possibility and nowise a condition for it. This peaceable welcome is
produced primordially in the gentleness of the feminine face, in which
C. I and Dependence                          151
the separated being can recollect itself, because of which it inhabits, and
in its dwelling accomplishes separation. Inhabitation and the intimacy of
the dwelling which make the separation of the human being possible
thus imply a first revelation of the Other.
Thus the idea of infinity, revealed in the face, does not only require a
separated being; the light of the face is necessary for separation. But
in founding the intimacy of the home the idea of infinity provokes
separation not by some force of opposition and dialectical evocation, but
by the feminine grace of its radiance. The force of opposition and of
dialectical evocation would, in integrating it into a synthesis, destroy
transcendence.
## D. The Dwelling


1. Habitation
Habitation can be interpreted as the utilization of an "implement"
among "implements." The home would serve for habitation as the
hammer for the driving in of a nail or the pen for writing. For it does
indeed belong to the gear consisting of things necessary for the life of
man. It serves to shelter him from the inclemencies of the weather, to
hide him from enemies or the importunate. And yet, within the system
of finalities in which human life maintains itself the home occupies a
privileged place. Not that of an ultimate end; if one can seek it as a
goal, if one can "enjoy" one's home, the home does not manifest its
originality in the possibility for its enjoyment. For all "implements,"
besides their utility as means in view of an end, admit of an immediate
interest. Thus I can take pleasure in handling a tool, in working, in ac-
complishing, using gestures which, to be sure, fit into a system of finality,
but whose end is situated beyond the pleasure or pain procured by these
isolated gestures themselves, which fill or nourish a life. The privi-
leged role of the home does not consist in being the end of human
activity but in being its condition, and in this sense its commencement.
The recollection necessary for nature to be able to be represented and
worked over, for it to first take form as a world, is accomplished as the
home. Man abides in the world as having come to it from a private
domain, from being at home with himself, to which at each moment he
can retire. He does not come to it from an intersideral space where he
would already be in possession of himself and from which at each
moment he would have to recommence a perilous landing. But he does
not find himself brutally cast forth and forsaken in the world.
Simultaneously without and within, he goes forth outside from an
inwardness [intimite]. Yet this inwardness opens up in a home which
is situated in that outside-for the home, as a building, belongs to a
world of objects. But this belongingness does not nullify the bearing
152
D. The Dwelling                              153
of the fact that every consideration of objects, and of buildings too, is
produced out of a dwelling. Concretely speaking the dwelling is not
situated in the objective world, but the objective world is situated by
relation to my dwelling. The idealist subject which constitutes a
priori its object and even the site at which it is found does not strictly
speaking constitute them a priori but precisely after the event, after
having dwelt in them as a concrete being. The event of dwelling
exceeds the knowing, the thought, and the idea in which, after the event,
the subject will want to contain what is incommensurable with a
knowing.
The analysis of enjoyment and living from . . . has shown that
being is not resolved into empirical events and thoughts that reflect those
events or aim at them "intentionally." To present inhabitation as a
becoming conscious of a certain conjuncture of human bodies and build-
ings is to leave aside, is to forget the outpouring of consciousness in
things, which does not consist in a representation of things by con-
sciousness, but in a specific intentionality of concretization. We can
formulate it in this way: the consciousness of a world is already con-
sciousness through that world. Something of that world seen is an organ
or an essential means of vision: the head, the eye, the eyeglasses, the light,
the lamps, the books, the school. The whole of the civilization of labor
and possession arises as a concretization of the separated being effectuat-
ing its separation. But this civilization refers to the incarnation of
consciousness and to inhabitation-to existence proceeding from the inti-
macy of a home, the first concretization. The very notion of an idealist
subject has come from a failure to recognize this overflowing of concreti-
zation. The for itself of the subject was posited in a sort of ether, and
its position added nothing to this representation of itself by itself-which
included that position. Contemplation, with its pretension to constitute,
after the event, the dwelling itself, assuredly evinces separation, or,
better yet, is an indispensable moment of its production. But the
dwelling cannot be forgotten among the conditions for representation,
even if representation is a privileged conditioned, absorbing its condition.
For it absorbs it only after the event, a posteriori. Hence the subject
contemplating a world presupposes the event of dwelling, the withdrawal
from the elements ( that is, from immediate enjoyment, already uneasy
about the morrow), recollection in the intimacy of the home.
The isolation of the home does not arouse magically, does not "chemi-
cally" provoke recollection, human subjectivity. The terms must be
154                        Totality and Infinity
reversed: recollection, a work of separation, is concretized as existence in
a dwelling, economic existence. Because the I· exists recollected it
takes refuge empirically in the home. Only from this recollection does
the building take on the signification of being a dwelling. But "concreti-
zation" does not only reflect the possibility it concretizes, rendering
explicit the articulations enveloped in it. Interiority concretely accom-
plished by the home, the passage to act-the energy--of recollection
in the dwelling, opens up new possibilities which the possibility of
recollection did not contain analytically, but which, being essential to its
energy, are manifested only when it unfolds. How does habitation,
actualizing this recollection, this intimacy and this warmth or gentle-
ness of intimacy, make labor and representation, which complete the
structure of separation, possible? We shall see shortly, but first it is
important to describe the "intentional implications" of recollection itself
and of the gentleness in which it is lived.


2. Habitation and the Feminine
Recollection, in the current sense of the term, designates a suspension
of the immediate reactions the world solicits in view of a greater
attention to oneself, one's possibilities, and the situation. It is already a
movement of attention freed from immediate enjoyment, for no longer
deriving its freedom from the agreeableness of the elements. From what
then? How would a total reflection be allowed a being that never
becomes the bare fact of existing, and whose existence is life, that is, life
from something? How, in the midst of a life which is life from . . . ,
which en joys elements, and which is preoccupied with overcoming the
insecurity of enjoyment, is a distance to be produced? Does recollection
amount to maintaining oneself in an indifferent region, in a void, in one
of those interstices of being in which the Epicurean gods reside? The I
would thereby lose the confirmation which as life from . . . and enjoy-
ment of . . . it receives in the element which nourishes it, without
receiving this confirmation from elsewhere. Or would the distance with
regard to enjoyment, rather than signifying the cold void of the inter-
stices of being, be lived positively as a dimension of interiority beginning
with the intimate familiarity into which life is immersed?
The familiarity of the world does not only result from habits acquired
in this world, which take from it its roughnesses and measure the
adaptation of the living being to a world it enjoys and from which it
D. The Dwelling                            155
nourishes itself; familiarity and intimacy are produced as a gentleness
that spreads over the face of things. This gentleness is not only a
conformity of nature with the needs of the separated being, which from
the first enjoys them and constitutes itself as separate, as I, in
that enjoyment, but is a gentleness coming from an affection [amitie] for
that I. The intimacy which familiarity already presupposes is an inti-
macy with someone. The interiority of recollection is a solitude in a
world already human. Recollection refers to a welcome.
But how can the separation of solitude, how can intimacy be produced
in face of the Other? Is not the presence of the Other already language
and transcendence?
For the intimacy of recollection to be able to be produced in the
oecumenia of being the presence of the Other must not only be revealed
in the face which breaks through its own plastic image, but must be
revealed, simultaneously with this presence, in its withdrawal and in its
absence. This simultaneity is not an abstract construction of dialectics,
but the very essence of discretion. And the other whose presence is
discreetly an absence, with which is accomplished the primary hospitable
welcome which describes the field of intimacy, is the Woman. The
woman is the condition for recollection, the interiority of the Home,
and inhabitation.
The simple living from . . . the spontaneous agreeableness of the
elements is not yet habitation. But habitation is not yet the transcend-
ence of language. The Other who welcomes in intimacy is not the you
[vous] of the face that reveals itself in a dimension of height, but pre-
cisely the thou [tu] of familiarity: a language without teaching, a silent
language, an understanding without words, an expression in secret. The
I-Thou in which Buber sees the category of interhuman relationship is
the relation not with the interlocutor but with feminine alterity. This
alterity is situated on another plane than language and nowise represents
a truncated, stammering, still elementary language. On the contrary,
the discretion of this presence includes all the possibilities of the tran-
scendent relationship with the Other. It is comprehensible and exercises
its function of interiorization only on the ground of the full human
personality, which, however, in the woman, can be reserved so as to open
up the dimension of interiority. And this is a new and irreducible
possibility, a delightful lapse in being, and the source of gentleness in
itself.
Familiarity is an accomplishment, an en-ergy of separation. With it
156                        Totality and Infinity
separation is constituted as dwelling and inhabitation. To exist hence-
forth means to dwell. To dwell is not the simple fact of the anonymous
reality of a being cast into existence as a stone one casts behind one-
self; it is a recollection, a coming to oneself, a retreat home with
oneself as in a land of refuge, which answers to a hospitality, a.n
expectancy, a human welcome. In human welcome the language that
keeps silence remains an essential possibility. Those silent comings and
goings of the feminine being whose footsteps reverberate the secret depths
of being are not the turbid mystery of the animal and feline presence
whose strange ambiguity Baudelaire likes to evoke.
The separation that is concretized through the intimacy of the dwell-
ing outlines new relations with the elements.


3. The Home and Possession
The home does not implant the separated being in a ground to leave
it in vegetable communication with the elements. It is set back from
the anonymity of the earth, the air, the light, the forest, the road, the sea,
the river. It has a "street front," but also its secrecy. With the dwell-
ing the separated being breaks with natural existence, steeped in a
medium where its enjoyment, without security, on edge, was being
inverted into care. Circulating between visibility and invisibility, one is
always bound for the interior of which one's home, one's corner, one's
tent, or one's cave is the vestibule. The primordial function of the home
does not consist in orienting being by the architecture of the building
and in discovering a site, but in breaking the plenum of the element,
in opening in it the utopia in which the "I" recollects itself in dwelling at
home with itself. But separation does not isolate me, as though I were
simply extracted from these elements. It makes labor and property pos-
sible.
The ecstatic and immediate enjoyment to which, aspired as it were by
the uncertain abyss of the element, the I was able to give itself over, is
adjourned and delayed in the home. But this suspension does not reduce
to nothing the relationship of the I with the elements. The dwelling
remains in its own way open upon the element from which it separates.
The ambiguity of distance, both removal and connection, is lifted
by .the window that makes possible a look that dominates, a look of him
who escapes looks, the look that contemplates. The elements remain
at the disposal of the I-to take or to leave. Labor will henceforth
D. The Dwelling                               157
draw things from the elements and thus discover the world. This
primordial grasp, this emprise of labor, which arouses things and trans-
forms nature into a world, presupposes, just as does the contemplation
of the gaze, the recollection of the I in its dwelling. The movement by
which a being builds its home, opens and ensures interiority to itself, is
constituted in a movement by which the separated being recollects itself.
With the dwelling the latent birth of the world is produced.
The postponement of enjoyment makes accessible a world-being
lying escheat, but at the disposal of whoever will take possession of
it. There is here no causality: the world does not result from this
postponement decided in an abstract thought. The postponement of
enjoyment has no other concrete signification than this putting at one's
disposal which accomplishes it, which is its en-ergy. A new conjuncture
in being-accomplished by the sojourn in a dwelling and not by an ab-
stract thought-is necessary for the deployment of this en-ergy. This
sojourn in a dwelling, inhabitation, before imposing itself as an empirical
fact, conditions every empiricism and the very structure of the fact im-
posed on contemplation. And conversely presence "at home with one-
self" exceeds the apparent simplicity the abstract analysis of the "for
itself" finds in it.
We shall describe in the pages that follow the relation that the home
establishes with a world to be possessed, to be acquired, to be rendered
interior. The first movement of economy is in fact egoist-it is not
transcendence; it is not expression. The labor that draws the things
from the elements in which I am steeped discovers durable substances,
but forthwith suspends the independence of their durable being by
acquiring them as movable goods,* transportable, put in reserve, depos-
ited in the home.
The home that founds possession is not a possession in the same sense
as the movable goods** it can collect and keep. It is possessed because it
already and henceforth is hospitable for its proprietor. This refers us to
its essential interiority, and to the inhabitant that inhabits it before every
inhabitant, the welcoming one par excellence, welcome in itself-the
feminine being. Need one add that there is no question here of defying
ridicule by maintaining the empirical truth or countertruth that every

• "Bien-meubles."
•• "Les choses meubles"-The thing (chose) will be defined as a "meuble"-
being related to the home by the possessive grasp it is a "movable," a "fur-
nishing." Cf. p. 166-161.-Trans.
158                        Totality and Infinity
home in fact presupposes a woman? The feminine has been encountered
in this analysis as one of the cardinal points of the horizon in which the
inner life takes place-and the empirical absence of the human being of
"feminine sex" in a dwelling nowise affects the dimension of femininity
which remains open there, as the very welcome of the dwelling.


4. Possession and Labor
The access to the world is produced in a movement that starts from
the utopia of the dwelling and traverses a space to effect a primordial
grasp, to seize and to take away. The uncertain future of the element
is suspended. The element is fixed between the four walls of the home,
is calmed in possession. It appears there as a thing, which can, per-
haps, be defined by tranquillity-as in a "still life." This grasp operated
on the elemental is labor.
The possession of things proceeding from the home, produced
by labor, is to be distinguished from the immediate relation with
the non-I in enjoyment, the possession without acquisition enjoyed by the
sensibility steeped in the element, which "possesses" without taking.
In enjoyment the I assumes nothing; from the first it lives from . . . .
Possession by enjoyment is one with enjoyment; no activity precedes
sensibility. But to possess by enjoying is also to be possessed and to be
delivered to the fathomless depth, the disquieting future of the ele-
ment.
Possession proceeding from the dwelling is to be distinguished from
the content possessed and the enjoyment of that content. In the element,
which exalts but also transports the enjoying I, labor in its possessive
grasp suspends the independence of the element: its being. The thing
evinces this hold or this comprehension-this ontology. Possession neu-
tralizes this being: as property the thing is an existent that has lost its
being. But in this suspension possession com-prehends the being of the
existent, and only thus does the thing arise. Ontology is a relation with
things which manifests things; the ontology that grasps the being of the
existent is a spontaneous and pretheoretical work of every inhabitant of
the earth. Possession masters, suspends, postpones the unforeseeable
future of the element-its independence, its being. "Unforeseeable
future," not because it exceeds the reach of vision, but because, faceless
and losing itself in nothingness, it is inscribed in the fathomless depth of
the element, coming from an opaque density without origin, the bad
D. The Dwelling                             159
infinite or the indefinite, the apeiron. It has no origin because it has no
substance, does not cling to a "something," quality that qualifies nothing,
without zero-point through which any axis of coordinates would pass,
prime matter absolutely undetermined. To suspend this independence of
being, this materiality of the elemental non-I, by possession does not
amount to thinking this suspension or obtaining it by the effect of a
formula. The way of access to the fathomless obscurity of matter is not
an idea of infinity, but labor. Possession is accomplished in taking-pos-
session or labor, the destiny of the hand. The hand is the organ
of grasping and taking, the first and blind grasping in the teeming mass:
it relates• to me, to my egoist ends, things drawn from the element,
which, beginningless and endless, bathes and inundates the separated
being. But the hand relating the elemental to the finality of needs con-
stitutes things only by separating its take from immediate enjoyment,
depositing it in the dwelling, conferring on it the status of a possession.
Labor is the very en-ergy of acquisition. It would be impossible in a
being that had no dwelling.
The hand accomplishes its proper function prior to every execution of
a plan, every projection of a project, every finality that would lead out of
being at home with oneself. The hand's rigorously economic movement
of seizure and acquisition is dissimulated by the traces, "wastes," and
"works" this movement of acquisition, returning to the interiority of the
home, leaves in its wake. These works, as city, field, garden, landscape,
recommence their elemental existence. Labor in its primary intention is
this acquisition, this movement toward oneself; it is not a transcendence.
Labor conforms with the elements from which it draws the things. It
grasps matter as raw material. In this primordial gr~sp matter at the
same time announces its anonymity and renounces it. It announces it,
for labor, the hold on matter, is not a vision or thought in which mat-
ter already determined would be defined by relation to infinity; within
the grasp matter precisely remains fundamentally indefinite and, in the
intellectual sense of the term, incomprehensible. But it renounces
its anonymity, since the primordial hold of labor introduces it into a
world of the identifiable, masters it, and puts it at the disposal of a being
recollecting and identifying itself prior to every civil status, every
quality, proceeding only from itself.
Labor's hold on the indefinite does not resemble the idea of infinity.

• ''Rapporte": to "bring back."-Trana.
160                        Totality and Infinity
Labor "defines" matter without recourse to the idea of infinity. The
primordial technique does not put into practice an antecedent "knowl-
edge," but has immediately a hold on matter. The power of the hand
that grasps or tears up or crushes or kneads relates the element, not to an
infinity by relation to which the thing would be defined, but to an end in
the sense of a goal, to the goal of need. A fathomless depth divined by
enjoyment in the element yields to labor, which masters the future
and stills the anonymous rustling of the there is, the uncontrolla-
ble stirring of the elemental, disquieting even within enjoyment itself.
This fathomless obscurity of matter is presented to labor as resistance
and not as the face to face. Not as an idea of resistance, not as a
resistance announced in an idea, or, as a face, announcing itself to be ab-
solute-but already in contact with the hand that breaks it, and virtually
overcome. The laborer will subjugate it; it does not oppose frontally,
but as already abdicating to the hand which seeks its vulnerable point,
which, already ruse and industry, reaches for it obliquely. Labor grap-
ples with the fallacious resistance of nameless matter, the infinity of its
nothingness. Thus in the last analysis labor cannot be called violence: it
is applied to what is faceless, to the resistance of nothingness. It acts in
the phenomenon. It attacks only the facelessness of the pagan gods
whose nothingness is henceforth exposed. Prometheus stealing the fire of
the heavens symbolizes industrious labor in its impiety.
Labor masters or suspends sine die the indeterminate future of the
element. By taking hold of things, by treating being as a furnishing,
transportable into a home, it disposes of the unforeseeable future in
which being's ascendancy over us was portended; it reserves this future
for itself. Possession removes being from change. In essence durable, it
does not only endure as a state of mind; it affirms its power over time,
over what belongs to nobody--over the future. Possession posits the
product of labor as what remains permanent in time, a substance.
Things present themselves as solids with contours clearly delimited.
Along with tables, chairs, envelopes, notebooks, pens-fabricated things
-stones, grains of salt, clumps of earth, icecles, apples are things. The
form which separates the object, which delineates sides for it, seems to
constitute it. One thing is distinct from another because an inter-
val separates them. But a part of a thing is in its turn a thing: the
back, the leg of the chair, for example. But also any fragment of the leg
is a thing, even if it· does not constitute one of its articulations-every-
thing one can detach and remove from it. The contour of the thing
D. The Dwelling                            161
marks the possibility of detaching it, moving it without the others, tak-
ing it away. A thing is a movable-afurnishing [meuble]. It keeps a
certain proportion relative to the human body. This proportion subjects
it to the hand, and not only to enjoyment. The hand both brings the
elemental qualities to enjoyment, and takes and keeps them for
future enjoyment. The hand delineates a world by drawing what it
grasps from the element, delineating definite beings having forms, that is,
solids; the informing of the formless is solidification, emergence of the
graspable, the existent, support of qualities. Substantiality thus does not
reside in the sensible nature of things, since sensibility coincides with
enjoyment enjoying an "adjective" without substantive, a pure quality, a
quality without support. Abstraction, which would promote the sensible
to a concept, would not confer upon it the substantiality the sensible
content lacks-unless we stress, not the content of the concept, but the
latent birth of the concept in the primordial hold effected by labor. The
intelligibility of the concept would then designate its reference to the
seizure by labor by which possession is produced. The substantiality of
a thing lies in its solidity, offering itself to the hand which takes and
takes away.
The hand is thus not only the point at which we communicate a
certain quantity of force to matter. It traverses the indetermination of
the element, suspends its unforeseeable surprises, postpones the enjoyment
in which they already threaten. The hand takes and comprehends•; it
recognizes the being of the existent, seizing upon the substance and
not the shadow; and at the same time it suspends that being, since
being is its possession. And yet this suspended, tamed being is main-
tained, is not worn away in the enjoyment that consumes and uses up.
For a time, it is posited as durable, as substance. To some extent things
are the non-edible, the tool, the object of everyday use, the instrument of
labor, a good. The hand comprehends the thing not because it touches it
on all sides at the same time (it does not touch it throughout), but
because it is no longer a sense-organ, pure enjoyment, pure sensibility,
but is mastery, domination, disposition-which do not belong to the
order of sensibility. An organ for taking, for acquisition, it gathers
the fruit but holds it far from the lips, keeps it, puts it in reserve,
possesses it in a home. The dwelling conditions labor. The hand that
acquires is burdened by what it takes; it does not found possession

• " .•. prend et comprend •••"
162                        Totality and Infinity
by itself. Moreover the very project of acquisition presupposes the
recollection of the dwelling. Boutroux says somewhere that possession
prolongs our body. But the body as naked body is not the first posses-
sion; it is still outside of having and not having. We dispose of our body
inasmuch as we have already suspended the being of the element that
bathes us, by inhabiting. The body is my possession according as my
being maintains itself in a home at the limit of interiority and exteriority.
The extraterritoriality of a home conditions the very possession of my
body.
Substance refers to the dwelling, that is, in the etymological sense of
the term, to economy. Possession grasps being in the object, but it grasps
it, that is, forthwith contests it. In placing it in my home as a possession
it confers upon it a being of pure appearance, a phenomenal being; the
thing that is mine or another's is not in itself. Possession alone touches
substance; the other relations with the thing only affect attributes. The
function of being implement, as the value the things bear, imposes itself
to spontaneous consciousness not as substance, but as one of the attributes
of these beings. The access to values, usage, manipulation and manufac-
ture rest on possession, on the hand that takes, that acquires, that brings
back home. The substantiality of a thing, correlative of possession,
does not consist in the thing presenting itself absolutely. In their
presentation things are acquired, are given.
Because it is not in itself a thing can be exchanged and accordingly
be compared, be quantified, and consequently already lose its very iden-
tity, be reflected in money. The identity of a thing is thus not its
primordial structure. It disappears as soon as the thing is approached
as matter. Property alone institutes permanence in the pure quality of
enjoyment, but this permanence disappears forthwith in the phenome-
nality reflected in money. As property, merchandise, bought and sold,
a thing is revealed in the market as susceptible of belonging, being
exchanged, and accordingly as convertible into money, susceptible of
dispersing in the anonymity of money.
But possession itself refers to more profound metaphysical relations.
A thing does not resist acquisition; the other possessors-those whom
one cannot possess--contest and therefore can sanction possession itself.
Thus the possession of things issues in a discourse. The action that is
beyond labor, presupposing the absolute resistance of the face of another
being, is command and word-or the violence of murder.

5. Labor, the Body, Consciousness
The doctrine that interprets the world as a horizon from which
things are presented as implements, the equipment of an existence
concerned for its being, fails to recognize the being established at the
threshold of an interiority the dwelling makes possible. Every manipula-
tion of a system of tools and implements, every labor, presupposes a
primordial hold on the things, possession, whose latent birth is marked by
the home, at the frontier of interiority. The world is a possible posses-
sion, and every transformation of the world by industry is a variation of
the regime of property. Proceeding from the dwelling, possession, ac-
complished by the quasi-miraculous grasp of a thing in the night, in the
apeiron of prime matter, discovers a world. The grasp of a thing
illuminates the very night of the apeiron: it is not the world that makes
things possible. On the other hand, the intellectualist conception of
a world as a spectacle given to impassive contemplation likewise fails to
recognize the recollection of the dwelling, without which the incessant
buzzing of the element cannot present itself to the hand that grasps, for
without the recollection of the dwelling the hand qua hand cannot arise in
the body immersed in the element. Contemplation is not the suspension
of the activity of man; it comes after the suspension of the chaotic and
thus independent being of the element, and after the encounter of the
Other who calls in question possession itself. Contemplation in any case
presupposes the very mobilization of the thing, grasped by the hand.
In the preceding considerations the body appeared not as an object
among other objects, but as the very regime in which separation holds
sway, as the "how" of this separation and so to speak as an adverb rather
than as a substantive. It is as though in the vibration of separated
existing there would by essence be produced a node where a movement of
interiorization meets a movement of labor and acquisition directed
toward the fathomless depth of the elements whereby the separated
being is placed between two voids, in the "somewhere" in which it posits
itself precisely as separate. This situation must be deduced and de-
scribed more closely.
In the paradisal enjoyment, timeless and carefree, the distinction
between activity and passivity is undone in agreeableness [agrement].
Enjoyment is wholly nourished by the outside it inhabits, but its agreea-
bleness manifests its sovereignty, a sovereignty as foreign to the freedom
164                        Totality and Infinity
of a causa sui, which nothing outside could affect, as to the Heideggerian
Geworfenheit, which, caught up in the other that limits it and negates it,
suffers from this alterity as much as would an idealist freedom. The
separated being is separated or content in its joy of breathing, seeing, and
feeling. The other in which it jubilates-the elements-is initially
neither for nor against it. No assumption marks the primary relation of
enjoyment, which is neither suppression of nor reconciliation with the
"other". But what is distinctive about the sovereignty of the I that
vibrates in enjoyment is that it is steeped in a medium and consequently
undergoes influences. The originality of influence lies in that the au-
tonomous being of enjoyment can be discovered, in this very enjoyment
to which it cleaves, to be determined by what it is not, but without
enjoyment being broken up, without violence being produced. It appears
as the product of the medium in which, however, it bathes, self-sufficient.
Autochthony is at the same time an attribute of sovereignty and of
submission; they are simultaneous. What has influence over life seeps
into it like a sweet poison. It is alienated, but even in suffering the
alienation comes to it from within. This ever possible inversion of life
cannot be stated in terms of limited or finite freedom. Freedom is
presented here as one of the possibilities of the primordial equivocation
that plays in the autochthonous life. The existence of this _equivocat!<>n
is the body. The sovereignty of enjoyment nourishes its independence
with a dependence on the other. The sovereignty of enjoyment runs the
risk of a betrayal: the alterity from which it lives already expels it from
paradise. Life is a body, not only lived body [corps propre], where its
self-sufficiency emerges, but a cross-roads of physical forces, body-effect.
In its deep-seated fear life attests this ever possible inversion of the body-
master into body-slave, of health into sickness. To be a body is on
the one hand to stand [se tenir ], to be master of oneself, and, on the
other hand, to stand on the earth, to be in the other, and thus to be
encumbered by one's body. But-we repeat-this encumberment
is not produced as a pure dependence; it forms the happiness of him who
enjoys it. What is necessary to my existence in order to subsist interests
my existence. I pass from this dependence to this joyous independence,
and in my very suffering I derive my existence from within. To be at
home with oneself in something other than oneself, to be oneself while
living from something other than oneself, to live from . . . , is concre-
tized in corporeal existence. "Incarnate thought" is not initially pro-
duced as a thought that acts on the world, but as a separated existence
D. The Dwelling                             165
which affirms its independence in the happy dependence of need. It
is not that this equivocation amounts to two successive points of view
on separation; their simultaneity constitutes the body. To neither of
the aspects which reveal themselves in turn does the last word belong.
The dwelling suspends or postpones this betrayal by making acquisi-
tion and labor possible. The dwelling, overcoming the insecurity of life,
is a perpetual postponement of the expiration in which life risks founder-
ing. The consciousness of death is the consciousness of the perpetual
postponement of death, in the essential ignorance of its date. Enjoyment
as the body that labors maintains itself in this primary postponement,
that which opens the very dimension of time.
The suffering of the recollected being, which is patience in the primary
sense, pure passivity, is at the same time openness upon duration, post-
ponement, within this suffering. In patience the imminence of defeat,
but also a distance in its regard, coincide. The ambiguity of the body is
consciousness.
There therefore exists no duality-lived body and physical body-
which would have to be reconciled. The dwelling which lodges and
prolongs life, the world life acquires and utilizes by labor, is also
the physical world where labor is interpreted as a play of anonymous
forces. For the forces of the exterior world the dwelling is only a
postponement. The domiciled being stands out from the things only
because it accords itself a delay, because it "delays the effect," because it
labors.
We have not contested the spontaneity of life. We have, on the con-
trary, reduced the problem of the interaction of the body and the world
to inhabitation, to "living from . . . ," where the schema of a freedom
causa sui incomprehensibly limited is no longer to be found. Freedom
as a relation of life with an other that lodges it, and by which life
is at home with itself, is not a finite freedom; it is virtually a null
freedom. Freedom is as it were the by-product of life. I ts adhesion to
the world in which it risks being lost is precisely, and at the same time,
that by which it defends itself and is at home with itself. This body,
a sector of an elemental reality, is also what permits taking hold of
the world, laboring. To be free is to build a world in which one
could be free. Labor comes from a being that is a thing among things
and in contact with things, but, within this contact, coming from its
being at home with itself. Consciousness does not fall into a body-
is not incarnated; it is a disincarnation-or, more exactly, a postponing
166                         Totality and Infinity
of the corporeity of the body. This is not produced in the ether of ab-
straction but as all the concreteness of dwelling and labor. To be con-
scious is to be in relation with what is, but as though the present of what
is were not yet entirely accomplished and only constituted the future of a
recollected being. To be conscious is precisely to have time-not to ex-
ceed the present time in the project that anticipates the future, but to have
a distance with regard to the present itself, to be related to the element
in which one is settled as to what is not yet there. All the freedom of
inhabitation depends on the time that, for the inhabitant, still always re-
mains. The incommensurable, that is, the incomprehensible format
of the surrounding medium leaves time. The distance with regard to
the element to which the I is given over menaces it in its dwelling only
in the future. For the moment the present is only consciousness of
danger, fear, which is feeling par excellence. The indetermination of
the element, its future, becomes consciousness, the possibility of making
use of time. Labor characterizes not a freedom that has detached itself
from being, but a will: a being that is threatened, but has time at its
disposal to ward off the threat.
The will marks, in the general economy of being, the point where the
definitiveness of an event is produced as non-definitive. The strength of
the will does not proceed as a force more powerful than the obstacle. It
does not approach the obstacle head on, but consists in always giving
oneself a distance with regard to it, catching sight of an interval between
oneself and the imminence of the obstacle. To will is to forestall
danger. To conceive the future is to fore-stall.• To labor is to delay its
expiration. But labor is possible only in a being that has the structure of
the body, a being grasping beings, that is, recollected at home with itself
and only in relation with the non-I.
But time, which manifests itself in the recollection of dwelling, presup-
poses (as we will explain further) the relation with an other that is not
given to labor-the relationship with the Other, with infinity, metaphys-
ics.
This ambiguity of the body, by which the I is engaged in the other but
comes always from the hither side, is produced in labor. Labor does not
consist in being first cause in a continuous chain of causes such as an
already illuminated thought apperceives it, being the cause that would
be operative the moment thought, proceeding backward from the end,

• "Conccvoir l'avenir, c'est pre-venir."
D. The Dwelling                             167
would stop upon the cause closest to us because coinciding with us. The
different causes closely linked form a mechanism whose essence is ex-
pressed in the machine. The wheels of machinery are perfectly adjusted
to one another and form an unbroken continuity. In the case of a
machine one can just as well say that the result is the final cause, or the
effect, of the first movement. But the movement of the body that
releases the machine's action, the hand that bears itself toward the
hammer or the nail that is to be driven in, is not simply the efficient cause
of this end, while the end would be the final cause of the movement.
For in the movement of the hand it is always to some measure a matter
of seeking and catching hold of the goal, with all the contingencies this
involves. This distance hollowed out and traversed by the body toward
the machine or the mechanism it sets into motion may be greater or less;
its margin can be much restricted in habitual gestures. But even
when the gesture is habitual, skill and practice are needed to guide the
habit.
In other words, the action of the body, which after the event will be
statable in terms of causality, unfolds at the time under the dominion of
a cause which is, in the true sense of the term, final. The intermediaries
that will enable this distance to be filled in, so as to release one another
automatically, are not yet found. The hand ventures forth and catches
hold of its goal with an inevitable share of chance or of mischance, since
it can miss its try. The hand is by essence groping and emprise.
Groping is not a technically imperfect action, but the condition for all
technique. The end is not caught sight of as an end in a disincarnate
aspiration, whose destiny it would fix as the cause fixes the destiny of the
effect. If the determinism of an end cannot be converted into a
determinism of a cause, this is because the conception of an end is
inseparable from its realization; an end does not attract, is not in some
measure inevitable, but is caught hold of, and thus presupposes the body
qua hand. Only a being endowed with organs can conceive a technical
finality, a relation between the end and the tool. The end is a term the
hand searches for in the risk of missing it. The body as possibility of
a hand-and its whole corporeity can be substituted for the hand-exists
in the virtuality of this movement betaking itself toward the tool.
Groping, the work of the hand par excellence, and the work adequate
to the apeiron of the element, makes possible the whole originality of the
final cause. It is said that if the attraction that an end exercises is not
entirely reducible to a continuous series of shocks, a continuous propul-
168                        Totality and Infinity
sion, this is because the idea of the end governs the release of these shocks.
But this idea of the end would be an epiphenomenon were it not
manifested in the way the first shock is given: a thrust in the void, at
random. In reality the "representation" of the end and the movement of
the hand that plunges toward it through an unexplored distance, pre-
ceded by no searchlight, constitute but one and the same event, and define
a being that, while being in the midst of a world in which it is implanted,
yet comes to this world from the hither side of this world, from a
dimension of interiority-a being that inhabits the world, that is, that is
at home with itself in it. Groping reveals the position of the body which
at the same time is integrated into being and remains in its interstices,
always invited to traverse a distance at random, and maintains itself in
this position all by itself. Such is the position of a separated being.


6. The Freedom of Representation and Gift
To be separated is to dwell somewhere; separation is produced
positively in localization. The body does not happen as an accident to
the soul. Shall we say that it is the insertion of a soul in extension?
This metaphor solves nothing; there would remain the problem of
understanding the insertion of the soul in the extension of the body.
Appearing to representation as a thing among things, the body is in fact
the mode in which a being, neither spatial nor foreign to geometrical or
physical extension, exists separately. It is the regime of separation. The
somewhere of dwelling is produced as a primordial event relative to
which the event of the unfolding of physico-geometrical extension must
be understood-and not the reverse.
And yet representational thought which nourishes itself and lives
from the very being it represents to itself refers to an exceptional
possibility of this separated existence. It is not that to an intention
called theoretical, basis of the I, would be added volitions, desires, and
sentiments, so as to transform thought into life. The strictly intellec-
tualist thesis subordinates life to representation. It maintains that in
order to will it is first necessary to represent to oneself what one wills; in
order to desire, represent one's goal to oneself; in order to feel, represent
to oneself the object of the sentiment; and in order to act, represent to
oneself what one will do. But how would the tension and care of a life
arise from impassive representation? The converse thesis presents no
fewer difficulties. Does representation, as the limit case of an engage-
D. The Dwelling                               169
ment in reality, the residue of an act suspended and hesitant, represen-
tation as the misfire of action, exhaust the essence of theory?
If it is not possible to draw from an impassive contemplation of an
object the finality necessary for action, is it easier to derive from commit-
ment, from action, from care, the freedom of contemplation repre-
sentation evinces?
Moreover the philosophical meaning of representation does not become
evident from the simple opposition of representation to action. Does
impassiveness opposed to commitment sufficiently characterize representa-
tion? Is the freedom with which it is linked an absence of relation, an
outcome of history in which nothing remains other, and consequently a
sovereignty in the void?
Representation is conditioned. I ts transcendental pretension is con-
stantly belied by the life that is already implanted in the being represen-
tation claims to constitute. But representation claims to substitute itself
after the event for this life in reality, so as to constitute this very reality.
Separation has to be able to account for this constitutive conditioning
accomplished by representation-though representation be produced after
the event. The theoretical, being after the event, being essentially
memory, is to be sure not creative; but its critical essence-its retrogres-
sive movement-is no wise a possibility of enjoyment and labor. It
evinces a new energy, oriented upstream, counter-current, which the
impassiveness of contemplation expresses only superficially.
That representation is conditioned by life, but that this conditioning
could be reversed after the event-that idealism is an eternal temptation
-results from the very event of separation, which must not at any
moment be interpreted as an abstract cleavage in space. The fact of the
after-the-event does show that the possibility of constitutive representa-
tion does not restore to abstract eternity or to the instant the privilege
of measuring all things; it shows, on the contrary, that the production of
separation is bound to time, and even that the articulation of separation
in time is produced thus in itself and not only secondarily, for us.
The possibility of a representation that is constitutive but already rests
on the enjoyment of a real completely constituted indicates the radical
character of the uprootedness of him who is recollected in a home, where
the I, while steeped in the elements, takes up its position before a Nature.
The elements in and from which I live are also that to which I am
opposed. The feat of having limited a part of this world and having
closed it off, having access to the elements I enjoy by way of the door and
170                       Totality and Infinity
the window, realizes extraterritoriality and the sovereignty of thought,
anterior to the world to which it is posterior. Anterior posteri-
orly: separation is not thus "known"; it is thus produced. Memory is
precisely the accomplishment of this ontological structure. A marsh
wave that returns to wash the strand beneath the line it left, a spasm of
time conditions remembrance. Thus only do I see without being seen,
like Gyges, am no longer invaded by nature, no longer immersed in a
tone or an atmosphere. Thus only does the equivocal essence of the
home hollow out interstices in the continuity of the earth. The Heideg-
gerian analyses of the world have accustomed us to think that the "in
view of oneself" that characterizes Dasein, care in situation, in the
last analysis conditions every human product. In Being and Time the
home does not appear apart from the system of implements. But can the
"in view of oneself" characteristic of care be brought about without a
disengagement from the situation, without a recollection and without
extraterritoriality-without being at home with oneself? Instinct re-
mains inserted in its situation; the hand that gropes traverses a void at
random.
Whence does this transcendental energy come to me, this postpone-
ment which is time itself, this future in which memory will lay hold of a
past that was before the past, the "deep past, never past enough"-an
energy already presupposed by recollection in a home?
We have defined representation as a determination of the other by the
same, without the same being determined by the other. This definition
excluded representation from reciprocal relations, whose terms meet and
limit one another. To represent to oneself that from which I live would
be equivalent to remaining exterior to the elements in which I am
steeped. But if I cannot quit the space in which I am steeped, with a
dwelling I can but approach these elements, possess things. I can indeed
recollect myself in the midst of my life, which is life from. . . . How-
ever, the negative moment of this dwelling which determines possession,
the recollection which draws me out of submergence, is not a simple echo
of possession. We may not see in it the counterpart of presence to
things, as though the possession of things, as a presence to them, dialec-
tically contained the withdrawal from them. This withdrawal implies
a new event; I must have been in relation with something I do not live
from. This event is the relation with the Other who welcomes me in
the Home, the discreet presence of the Feminine. But in order that I
be able to free myself from the very possession that the welcome of the
D. The Dwelling                            171
Home establishes, in order that I be able to see things in themselves,
that is, represent them to myself, refuse both enjoyment and possession,
I must know how to give what I possess. Only thus could I situate my-
self absolutely above my engagement in the non-I. But for this I must
encounter the indiscreet face of the Other that calls me into question.
The Other-the absolutely other-paralyzes possession, which he contests
by his epiphany in the face. He can contest my possession only because
he approaches me not from the outside but from above. The same can
not lay hold of this other without suppressing him. But the untravers-
able infinity of the negation of murder is announced by this dimension
of height, where the Other comes to me concretely in the ethical
impossibility of commiting this murder. I welcome the Other who
presents himself in my home by opening my home to him.
The calling in question of the I, coextensive with the manifestation of
the Other in the face, we call language. The height from which
language comes we designate with the term teaching. Socratic maieutics
prevailed over a pedagogy that introduced ideas into a mind by vio-
lating or seducing ( which amounts to the same thing) that mind.
It does not preclude the openness of the very dimension of infinity, which
is height, in the face of the Master. This voice coming from another
shore teaches transcendence itself. Teaching signifies the whole infinity
of exteriority. And the whole infinity of exteriority is not first produced,
to then teach : teaching is its very production. The first teaching teaches
this very height, tantamount to its exteriority, the ethical. In this
commerce with the infinity of exteriority or of height the naivete
of the direct impulse, the naivete of the being exercising itself as a
force on the move, is ashamed of its naivete. It discovers itself as a vio-
lence, but thereby enters into a new dimension. Commerce with the al-
terity of infinity does not offend like an opinion; it does not limit a mind
in a way inadmissible to a philosopher. Limitation is produced only
within a toti.lity, whereas the relation with the Other breaks the ceiling
of the totality. It is fundamentally pacific. The other is not opposed to
me as a freedom other than, but similar to my own, and consequently
hostile to my own. The Other is not another freedom as arbitrary as my
own, in which case it would traverse the infinity that separates me
from him and enter under the same concept. His alterity is manifested
in a mastery that does not conquer, but teaches. Teaching is not a spe-
cies of a genus called domination, a hegemony at work within a totality,
but is the presence of infinity breaking the closed circle of totality.
172                        Totality and Infinity
Representation derives its freedom with regard to the world that
nourishes it from the relation essentially moral, that with the Other.
Morality is not added to the preoccupations of the I, so as to order
them or have them judged; it calls in question, and puts at a distance
from itself, the I itself. Representation began not in the presence of a
thing exposed to my violence but empirically escaping my powers, but
in my possibility of calling this violence into question, in a possibility
produced by the commerce with infinity, by society.
The positive deployment of this pacific relation with the other, with-
out frontier or any negativity, is produced in language. Language
does not belong among the relations that could appear through the
structures of formal logic; it is contact across a distance, relation
with the non-touchable, across a void. It takes place in the dimension of
absolute desire by which the same is in relation with an other that
was not simply lost by the same. We are not required to take contact or
vision to be the archetypal gestures of straightforwardness. The Other
is neither initially nor ultimately what we grasp or what we thematize.
For truth is neither in seeing nor in grasping, which are modes of
enjoyment, sensibility, and possession; it is in transcendence, in which
absolute exteriority presents itself in expressing itself, in a movement at
each instant recovering and deciphering the very signs it emits.
But the transcendence of the face is not enacted outside of the world,
as though the economy by which separation is produced remained beneath
a sort of beatific contemplation of the Other ( which would thereby turn
into the idolatry that brews in all contemplation). The "vision" of
the face as face is a certain mode of sojourning in a home, or-to
speak in a less singular fashion-a certain form of economic life.
No human or interhuman relationship can be enacted outside of economy;
no face can be approached with empty hands and closed home. Recollec-
tion in a home open to the Other-hospitality-is the concrete and
initial fact of human recollection and separation; it coincides with the
Desire for the Other absolutely transcendent. The chosen home
is the very opposite of a root. It indicates a disengagement, a wandering
[errance] which has made it possible, which is not a less with respect to
installation, but the surplus of the relationship with the Other,
metaphysics.
But the separated being can close itself up in its egoism, that is, in the
very accomplishment of its isolation. And this possibility of forgetting
the transcendence of the Other-of banishing with impunity all hospital-
D. The Dwelling                            173
ity ( that is, all language) from one's home, banishing the transcend-
ental relation that alone permits the I to shut itself up in itself-evinces
the absolute truth, the radicalism, of separation. Separation is not only
dialectically correlative with transcendence, as its reverse; it is accom-
plished as a positive event. The relation with infinity remains as another
possibility of the being recollected in its dwelli:J.g. The possibility for
the home to open to the Other is as essential to the essence of the home as
closed doors and windows. Separation would not be radical if the
possibility of shutting oneself up at home with oneself could not be
produced without internal contradiction as an event in itself, as atheism
itself is produced-if it should only be an empirical, psychological fact,
an illusion. Gyges's ring symbolizes separation. Gyges plays a double
game, a presence to the others and an absence, speaking to "others"
and evading speech; Gyges is the very condition of man, the possibility of
injustice and radical egoism, the possibility of accepting the rules of the
game, but cheating.
Our work in all its developments strives to free itself from the
conception that seeks to unite events of existence affected with opposite
signs in an ambivalent condition which alone would have ontological
dignity, while the events themselves proceeding in one direction or in
another would remain empirical, articulating nothing ontologically new.
The method practiced here does indeed consist in seeking the condition of
empirical situations, but it leaves to the developments called empirical, in
which the conditioning possibility is accomplished-it leaves to the eon-
eretization-an ontological role that specifies the meaning of the funda-
mental possibility, a meaning invisible in that condition.
The relationship with the Other is not produced outside of the world,
but puts in question the world possessed. The relationship with the
Other, transcendence, consists in speaking the world to the Other. But
language accomplishes the primordial putting in common-which refers
to possession and presupposes economy. The universality a thing receives
from the word that extracts it from the hie et nune loses its mystery in
the ethical perspective in which language is situated. The hie et nune
itself issues from possession, in which the thing is grasped, and language,
which designates it to the other, is a primordial dispossession, a first
donation. The generality of the word institutes a common world. The
ethical event at the basis of generalization is the underlying intention of
language. The relation with the Other does not only stimulate, provoke
generalization, does not only supply it with the pretext and the occasion
174                        Totality and Infinity
( this no one has ever contested), but is this generalization itself.
Generalization is a universalization-but universalization is not the
entry of a sensible thing into a no man's land* of the ideal, is not purely
negative like a sterile renunciation, but is the offering of the world to the
Other. Transcendence is not a vision of the Other, but a primordial
donation.
Language does not exteriorize a representation preexisting in me: it
puts in common a world hitherto mine. Language effectuates the entry
of things into a new ether in which they receive a name and become
concepts. It is a first action over and above labor, an action without
action, even though speech involves the effort of labor, even though, as
incarnate thought, it inserts us into the world, with the risks and hazards
of all action. At each instant it exceeds this labor by the generosity of
the offer it forthwith makes of this very labor. The analyses of language
that tend to present it as one meaningful action among others fail to
recognize this offering of the world, this offering of contents which
answers to the face of the Other or which questions him, and first opens
the perspective of the meaningful.
The "vision" of the face is inseparable from this offering language is.
To see the face is to speak of the world. Transcendence is not an optics,
but the first ethical gesture.

1. Separation Is an Economy
In affirming separation we are not transposing into an abstract for-
mula the empirical image of a spatial interval which joins its
extremities by the very space that separates them. Separation must take
form outside of this formalism, as an event that is not equivalent to its
contrary as soon as it is produced. To separate oneself, to not remain
bound up with a totality, is positively to be somewhere, in the home, to be
economically. The "somewhere" and the home render egoism, the pri-
mordial mode of being in which separation is produced, explicit. Egoism
is an ontological event, an effective rending, and not a dream running
along the surface of being, negligible as a shadow. The rending of
a totality can be produced only by the throbbing of an egoism that
is neither illusory nor subordinated in any way whatever to the totality it
rends. Egoism is life: life from . . . , or enjoyment. Enjoyment, given
over to the elements which content it but lead it off into the "nowhere"
and menace it, withdraws into a dwelling. So many opposed movements
-the submergence in the elements which begins to open up interior-
ity, the sojourn, happy and needy, on the earth, time, and the conscious-
ness which loosens the vice of being and ensures the mastery of a
world-are united in the corporeal being of man-nakedness and indig-
ence, exposed to the anonymous exteriority of heat and cold but recollect-
ing in the interiority of being at home with oneself, and hence labor
and possession. In laboring possession reduces to the same what at first
presented itself as other. Despite the infinite extension of needs it makes
possible economic existence remains within the same (just as animal
existence). I ts movement is centripetal.
But is not this interiority manifested on the outside by works? Do
not works succeed in breaking through the crust of separation? Do not
actions, gestures, manners, objects utilized and fabricated recount their
175
176                       Totality and Infinity
author? To be sure-but only if they have been clothed with the
signification of language, which is instituted above and beyond works.
Through works alone the I does not come outside; it withdraws from
them or congeals in them as though it did not appeal to the Other and
did not respond to him, but in its activity sought comfort, privacy, and
sleep. The lines of meaning traced in matter by activity are immediately
charged with equivocations, as though action, in pursuing its design, were
without regard for exteriority, without attention. In undertaking what
I willed I realized so many things I did not will: the work rises in the
midst of the wastes of labor. The worker does not hold in his hands all
the threads of his own action. He is exteriorized by acts that are already
in a sense abortive. If his works deliver signs, they have to be deciphered
without his assistance. If he participates in this deciphering, he speaks.
Thus the product of labor is not an inalienable possession, and it can be
usurped by the Other. Works have a destiny independent of the I, are
integrated in an ensemble of works: they can be exchanged, that is, be
maintained in the anonymity of money. Integration in an economic
world does not commit the interiority from which works proceed. This
inner life does not die away like a straw fire, but it does not recognize
itself in the existence attributed to it within economy. This is attested
in the consciousness the person has of the tyranny of the State. The
State awakens the person to a freedom it immediately violates.
The State which realizes its essence in works slips toward tyranny and
thus attests my absence from those works, which across the economic
necessities return to me as alien. From the work I am only deduced and
am already ill-understood, betrayed rather than expressed.
But neither do I break through the crust of separation by approaching
the Other in his works, which, like my own, are delivered over to the
anonymous field of the economic life, in which I maintain myself
egoist and separated, identifying in the diverse my own identity as the
same, through labor and possession. The Other signals himself but does
not present himself. The works symbolize him. The symbolism of
life and labor symbolizes in that very particular sense Freud discovered
in all our conscious manifestations and in our dreams, and which is the
essence of every sign, its primordial definition: it reveals only in con-
cealing. In this sense the signs constitute and protect my privacy.
To be expressed by one's life, by one's works, is precisely to decline ex-
pression. Labor remains economic; it comes from the home and returns
to it, a movement of Odyssey where the adventure pursued in the world
E. The World of Phenomena and Expression                 177
is but the accident of a return. Absolutely speaking, the interpretation of
the symbol can assuredly lead to an intention divined; but we penetrate
into this interior world as by burglary and without conjuring the absence.
The word alone-but disengaged from its density as a linguistic product
--can put an end to this absence.


2. Works and Expression
Things manifest themselves as answering to a question relative to
which they have a meaning-the question quid? This question calls for
a substantive and an adjective-inseparably. To this quest corresponds a
content, sensible or intellectual, a "comprehension" by concept. The
author of the work, approached from the work, will be present only as a
content. This content can not be detached from the context, from the
system in which the works themselves are integrated, and it answers to
the question by its place in the system. To ask what is to ask as what: it
is not to take the manifestation for itself.
But the question that asks about the quiddity is put to someone. He
who is to respond has long already presented himself, responding thus to
a question prior to every question in search of quiddities. In fact the
"who is it?" is not a question and is not satisfied by a knowing. He to
whom the question is put has already presented himself, without being a
content. He has presented himself as a face. The face is not a modality
of quiddity, an answer to a question, but the correlative of what is prior
to every question. What is prior to every question is not in its turn a
question nor a knowledge possessed a priori, but is Desire. The who
correlative of Desire, the who to whom the question is put, is, in
metaphysics, a "notion" as fundamental and as universal as quiddity and
being and the existent and the categories.
To be sure, most of the time the who is a what, We ask "Who is Mr.
X ?" and we answer: "He is the President of the State Council," or
"He is Mr. So-and-so." The answer presents itself as a quiddity; it
refers to a system of relations. To the question who? answers the
non-qualifiable presence of an existent who presents himself without
reference to anything, and yet distinguishes himself from every other
existent. The question whof envisages a face. The notion of the face
differs from every represented content. If the question who? does
not question in the same sense as the question what? it is that here what
one asks and he whom one questions coincide. To aim at a face is to
178                           Totality and Infinity
put the question who? to the very face that is the answer to this question;
the answerer and the answered coincide. The face, preeminently ex-
pression, formulates the first word: the signifier arising at the thrust
of his sign, as eyes that look at you.
The who involved in activity is not expressed in the activity, is not
present, does not attend his own manifestation, but is simply signified in
it by a sign in a system of signs, that is, as a being who is manifested
precisely as absent from his manifestation: a manifestation in the absence
of being-a phenomenon. When we understand man on the basis of his
works he is more surprised than understood.* His life and his labor
mask him. As symbols they call for interpretation. Here phenomenality
does not simply designate a relativity of knowledge, but a mode of being
where nothing is ultimate, where everything is a sign, a present absenting
itself from its presence and in this sense a dream. With the exteriority
that is not that of things symbolism disappears and the order of being
begins, and a day dawns from whose depths no new day is to dawn.
What inward existence lacks is not a being in the superlative, prolonging
and amplifying the equivocations of interiority and of its symbolism, but
an order where all the symbolisms are deciphered by beings that present
themselves absolutely-that express themselves. The same is not the
Absolute; its reality expressed in its work is absent from its work. In its
economic existence its reality is not total.
It is only in approaching the Other that I attend to myself. This does
not mean that my existence is constituted in the thought of the others.
An existence called objective, such as is reflected in the thought of the
others, and by which I count in universality, in the State, in history, in
the totality, does not express me, but precisely dissimulates me. The face
I welcome makes me pass from phenomenon to being in another sense: in
discourse I expose myself to the questioning of the Other, and this
urgency of the response-acuteness of the present--engenders me for
responsibility; as responsible I am brought to my final reality. This
extreme attention does not actualize what was in potency, for it is not
conceivable without the other. Being attentive signifies a surplus of
consciousness, and presupposes the call of the other. To be attentive is to
recognize the mastery of the other, to receive his command, or, more
exactly, to receive from him the command to command. When I seek
my final reality, I find that my existence as a "thing in itself" begins

• " ... ii est plus surpris que compris."
E. The World of Phenomena and Expression                   179
with the presence in me of the idea of Infinity. But this relation already
consists in serving the Other.
Death is not this master. Always future and unknown it gives rise to
fear or flight from responsibilities. Courage exists in spite of it. It has
its ideal elsewhere; it commits me to life. Death, source of all myths, is
present only in the Other, and only in him does it summon me urgently
to my final essence, to my responsibility.
For the totality of contentment to reveal its phenomenality and its
inadequateness to the absolute it does not suffice that a discontent be
substituted for contentment. Discontent still remains within the hori-
zons of a totality, as an indigence which, in need, anticipates its satisfac-
tion. Such is a lower proletariat that would covet but the comfort of
the bourgeois interior and its fleshpot horizons. The totality of content-
ment betrays its own phenomenality when an exteriority that does not
slip into the void of needs gratified or frustrated supervenes. The
totality of contentment reveals its phenomenality when this exteriority,
incommensurable with needs, breaks interiority by this very incommen-
surability. Interiority then discovers itself to be insufficient, but this
insufficiency does not designate any limitation imposed by this exteriority.
The insufficiency of interiority is not immediately convertible into needs
presaging their satisfaction or suffering from their penury; the broken
interiority is not mended in the horizons outlined by needs. Such an
exteriority reveals an insufficiency of the separated being that is without
possible satisfaction-not only unsatisfied in fact, but outside of every
perspective of satisfaction or unsatisfaction. The exteriority foreign to
needs would then reveal an insufficiency full of this very insuffi-
ciency and not of hopes, a distance more precious than contact, a non-pos-
session more precious than possession, a hunger that nourishes itself not
with bread but with hunger itself. This is not some romantic dream, but
what from the beginning of this research imposed itself as Desire.
Desire does not coincide with an unsatisfied need; it is situated beyond
satisfaction and nonsatisfaction. The relationship with the Other, or
the idea of Infinity, accomplishes it. Each can live it in the strange
desire of the Other that no voluptuosity comes to fulfill, nor close, nor
put to sleep. By virtue of this relationship man, withdrawn from the
element, recollected in a home, represents a world to himself. Because
of it, because of presence before the face of the Other, man does not
permit himself to be deceived by his glorious triumph as a living being,
and unlike the animal can know the difference between being and
180                        Totality and Infinity
phenomenon, can recognize his phenomenality, the penury of his pleni-
tude, a penury inconvertible into needs which, being beyond plenitude
and void, cannot be gratified.


3. Phenomenon and Being
The epiphany of exteriority, which exposes the deficiency of the sover-
eign interiority of the separated being, does not situate interiority, as one
part limited by another, in a totality. We here enter the order of Desire
and the order of relations irreducible to those governing totality. The
contradiction between the free interiority and the exteriority that should
limit it is reconciled in the man open to teaching.
Teaching is a discourse in which the master can bring to the student
what the student does not yet know. It does not operate as maieutics,
but continues the placing in me of the idea of infinity. The idea of
infinity implies a soul capable of containing more than it can draw from
itself. It designates an interior being that is capable of a relation with
the exterior, and does not take its own interiority for the totality of
being. This whole work seeks only to present the spiritual according to
this Cartesian order, prior to the Socratic order. For the Socratic
dialogue already presupposes beings who have decided for discourse, who
consequently have accepted its rules, whereas teaching leads to the logical
discourse without rhetoric, without flattery or seduction and hence with-
out violence, and maintaining the interiority of him who welcomes.
The man of enjoyment who remains in interiority, who ensures
his separation, can be unaware of his phenomenality. This possibility of
ignorance does not denote an inferior degree of consciousness, but is the
very price of separation. Separation as a break with participation
was deduced from the Idea of Infinity. It is therefore also a relation
extending over the irremediable abyss of this separation. If separation
had to be described in terms of enjoyment and economy, this is because
the sovereignty of man was nowise a simple reverse of the relation with
the Other. Separation not being reducible to a simple counterpart of
relation, the relationship with the Other does not have the same status as
the relations given to objectifying thought, where the distinction of terms
also reflects their union. The relationship between me and the Other
does not have the structure formal logic finds in all relations. The terms
remain absolute despite the relation in which they find themselves. The
relation with the Other is the only relation where such an overturning of
E. The World of Phenomena and Expression                    181
formal logic can occur. But we then understand that the idea of infinity,
which requires separation, requires it unto atheism, so profoundly that
the idea of infinity could be forgotten. The forgetting of transcendence
is not produced as an accident in a separated being; the possibility of this
forgetting is necessary for separation. The distance and interiority
remain intact in the resumption of the relationship; and when the soul
opens, in the marvel of teaching, the transitivity of teaching is neither
less nor more authentic than the freedom of the master and the student,
though the separated being thereby leaves the plane of economy and labor.
We have said that this moment when the separated being is discovered
without expressing itself, when it appears but absents itself from its
apparition, corresponds rather exactly to the meaning of phenomenon.
The phenomenon is the being that appears, but remains absent. It is not
an appearance, but a reality that lacks reality, still infinitely removed
from its being. In the work someone's intention has been divined, but he
has been judged in absentia. Being has not come to the assistance of
itself (as Plato says about written discourse); the interlocutor has not at-
tended his own revelation. One has penetrated into his interior, but in
his absence. He has been understood like a prehistoric man who has left
hatchets and drawings but no words. Everything comes to pass as
though the word, that word that lies and dissimulates, were absolutely
indispensable for the trial, to clarify the items of a dossier and the objects
constituting evidence, as though the word alone could assist the judges
and render the accused present, as though by the word alone the multiple
concurrent possibilities of the symbol, which symbolizes in silence and in
twilight, could be sorted out and give birth to the truth. Being is a
world in which one speaks and of which one speaks. Society is the
presence of being.
Being, the thing in itself, is not, with respect to the phenomenon, the
hidden. Its presence presents itself in its word. To posit the thing in
itself as hidden would be to suppose that it is with respect to the
phenomenon what the phenomenon is to the appearance. The truth of
disclosure is at most the truth of the phenomenon hidden under the
appearances; the truth of the thing in itself is not disclosed. The thing
in itself expresses itself. Expression manifests the presence of being, but
not by simply drawing aside the veil of the phenomenon. It is of itself
presence of a face, and hence appeal and teaching, entry into relation
with me-the ethical relation. And expression does not manifest the
presence of being by referring from the sign to the signified; it presents
182                        Totality and Infinity
the signifier. The signifier, he who gives a sign, is not signified. It is
necessary to have already been in the society of signifiers for the sign to
be able to appear as a sign. Hence the signifier must present himself
before every sign, by himself-present a face.
Speech is an incomparable manifestation: it does not accomplish the
movement from the sign to the signifier and the signified; it unlocks what
every sign closes up at the very moment it opens the passage that leads to
the signified, by making the signifier attend this manifestation of the
signified. This attendance measures the surplus of spoken language
over written language, which has again become signs. Signs are a
mute language, a language impeded. Language does not group symbols
into systems, but deciphers the symbols. But when this primordial
manifestation of the Other has already taken place, when an existent has
presented himself and come to the assistance of himself, not only verbal
signs but all signs can serve as language. But speech itself does not
always find the welcome that ought to be reserved to speech. For it
involves non-speech, and can express in the sense that implements,
clothing, and gestures express. In its mode of articulation, in its style,
speech signifies as an activity and as a product. It is to pure speech what
writing for graphologists is to the written expression for the reader.
Speech taken as an activity signifies as do furnishings or implements. It
does not have the total transparence of the gaze directed upon the gaze,
the absolute frankness of the face to face proffered at the bottom of all
speech. From my speech-activity I absent myself, as I am missing from
all my products. But I am the unfailing source of ever renewed
deciphering. And this renewal is precisely presence, or my attendance to
myself.
As long as the existence of man remains interiority it remains phe-
nomenal. The language by which a being exists for another is his unique
possibility to exist with an existence that is more than his interior
existence. The surplus that language involves with respect to all the
works and labors that manifest a man measures the distance between the
living man and the dead-who, however, is alone recognized by history,
which approaches him objectively in his work or his heritage. Between
the subjectivity shut up in its interiority and the subjectivity poorly heard
in history there is the attendance of the subjectivity that speaks.
The return to univocal being from the world of signs and symbols
proper to phenomenal existence does not consist in being integrated into a
whole such as understanding conceives and politics establishes it.
E. The World of Phenomena and Expression                   183
There the independence of the separated being is lost, unrecognized, and
oppressed. To return to exterior being, to being in the univocal sense,
the sense that hides no other sense, is to enter into the straightfor-
wardness of the face to face. This is not a play of mirrors but my
responsibility, that is, an existence already obligated. It places the center
of gravitation of a being outside of that being. The surpassing of
phenomenal or inward existence does not consist in receiving the recogni-
tion of the Other, but in offering him one's being. To be in oneself is to
express oneself, that is, already to serve the Other. The ground of
expression is goodness. To be Ka0'aur6 is to be good.
SECTION III


## Exteriority And The Face
## A. Sensibility And The Face


Is not the face given to vision? How does the epiphany as a face
determine a relationship different from that which characterizes all our
sensible experience?
The idea of intentionality has compromised the idea of sensation by
removing the character of being a concrete datum from this allegedly
purely qualitative and subjective state, foreign to all objectification.
Already the classical analysis had shown, from a psychological point of
view, its constructed character-the sensation graspable by introspection
is already a perception. It was said that we always find ourselves among
things: color is always extended and objective, the color of a dress, a
lawn, a wall; sound is a noise of a passing car, or a voice of someone
speaking. In fact nothing psychological would correspond to the simplic-
ity of the physiological definition of sensation. Sensation as a simple
quality floating in the air or in our soul represents an abstraction because,
without the object to which it refers, quality can have the signification of
being a quality only in a relative sense: by turning over a painting we can
see the colors of the objects painted as colors in themselves-but in fact
already as colors of the canvas that bears them. -Unless their purely
aesthetic effect would consist in this detachment from the object . . . .
But then sensation would result from a long thought process.
This critique of sensation failed to recognize the plane on which the
sensible life is lived as enjoyment. This mode of life is not to be
interpreted in function of objectification. Sensibility is not a fumbling
objectification. Enjoyment, by essence satisfied, characterizes all sensa-
tions whose representational content dissolves into their affective content.
The very distinction between representational and affective content is
tantamount to a recognition that enjoyment is endowed with a dynamism
other than that of perception. But we can speak of enjoyment or of
sensation even in the domain of vision and audition, when one has seen or
heard much, and the object revealed by the experiences is steeped in the
enjoyment---or suffering-of pure sensation, in which one has bathed and
187
188                        Totality and Infinity
lived as in qualities without support. The notion of sensation is
thus somewhat rehabilitated. In other words, sensation recovers a "real-
ity" when we see in it not the subjective counterpart of objective
qualities, but an enjoyment "anterior" to the crystallization of conscious-
ness, I and non-I, into subject and object. This crystallization occurs
not as the ultimate finality of enjoyment but as a moment of its becom-
ing, to be interpreted in terms of enjoyment. Rather than taking
sensations to be contents destined to fill a priori forms of objectivity, a
transcendental function sui generis must be recognized in them ( and for
each qualitative specificity in its own mode); a priori formal structures
of the non-I are not necessarily structures of objectivity. The specificity
of each sensation reduced precisely to that "quality without support or
extension" the sensualists sought in it designates a structure not neces-
sarily reducible to the schema of an object endowed with qualities. The
senses have a meaning that is not predetermined as objectification. It is
for having neglected in the sensibility this function of pure sensibility in
the Kantian sense of the term and a whole "transcendental aesthetics" of
"contents" of experience that we are led to posit the non-I in a univocal
sense, as the objectivity of the object. In fact we reserve a transcend-
ental function for visual and tactile qualities, and leave to qualities
coming from other senses only the role of adjectives clinging to the visible
and touched object-which is inseparable from labor and the home. The
object disclosed, discovered, appearing, a phenomenon, is the visible or
touched object. Its objectivity is interpreted without the other sensa-
tions taking part in it. The ever self-identical objectivity would be found
in the perspectives of vision or the movements of the hand that palpates.
As Heidegger, after St. Augustine, pointed out, we use the term vision
indifferently for every experience, even when it involves other senses than
sight. And we also use the grasp in this privileged sense. Idea and
concept cover with the whole of experience. This interpretation of
experience on the basis of vision and touch is not due to chance and can
accordingly expand into a civilization. It is incontestable that objecti-
fication operates in the gaze in a privileged way; it is not certain that
its tendency to inform every experience is inscribed, and unequivocably
so, in being. A phenomenology of sensation as enjoyment, a study of
what we could call its transcendental function, which does not neces-
sarily issue in the object nor in the qualitative specification of an object
(as such simply seen), would be required. The Critique of Pure ReasonJ
in discovering the transcendental activity of the mind, has made familiar
A. Sensibility and th,e Face                    189
the idea of a spiritual activity that does not issue in an object, even
though this revolutionary idea was in Kantian philosophy attenuated
in that the activity in question constituted the condition for the object. A
transcendental phenomenology of sensation would justify the return to
the term sensation to characterize the transcendental function of
the quality corresponding to it. For the ancient conception of sensation,
in which the affecting of a subject by an object did enter, would evoke
this function better than the naively realist language of the moderns.
We have maintained that enjoyment-which does not fit in the schema of
objectification and vision-does not exhaust its meaning in qualifying
the visible object. All our analyses of the preceding section were guided
by this conviction. They were also guided by the idea that representation
is not a work of the look by itself, but of language. But in order to
distinguish look and language, that is, the look and the welcome of the
face which language presupposes, we must analyse more closely the
privilege of vision.
As Plato noted, besides the eye and the thing, vision presupposes the
light. The eye does not see the light, but the object in the light. Vision
is therefore a relation with a "something" established within a relation
with what is not a "something." We are in the light inasmuch as we
encounter the thing in nothingness. The light makes the thing appear by
driving out the shadows; it empties space. It makes space arise specifi-
cally as a void. Inasmuch as the movement of the hand that touches
traverses the "nothing" of space, touch resembles vision. Never·heless
vision has over the touch the privilege of maintaining the object in this
void and receiving it always from this nothingness as from an origin,
whereas in touch nothingness is manifested to the free movement of pal-
pation. Thus for vision and for touch a being comes as though from
nothingness, and in this precisely resides their traditional philosophical
prestige. This coming forth from void is thus their coming from their
origin; this "openness" of experience or this experience of openness ex-
plains the privilege of objectivity and its claim to coincide with the very
being of existents. We find this schema of vision from Aristotle to
Heidegger. In the light of generality which does not exist is established
the relation with the individual. For Heidegger, an openness upon Be-
ing, which is not a being, which is not a "something," is necessary in
order that, in general, a "something" manifest itself. In the rather
formal fact that an existent is, in its work or its exercise of Being-in
its very independence-resides its intelligibility. Thus appear the struc-
190                             Totality and Infinity
tures of vision, where the relation of the subject with the object is sub-
ordinated to the relation of the object with the void of openness, which
is not an object. The comprehension of an existent consists in precisely
going beyond the existent, into the open. To comprehend the particular
being is to apprehend it out of an illuminated site it does not fill.
But is not this spatial void a "something"-the form of all experience,
the object of geometry, something seen in its turn? In fact, it is
necessary to make a stroke in order to see a line. Whatever be the
significance of the passage to the limit, the notions of intuitive geometry
will impose themselves upon us from the things seen: the line is the limit
of a thing; the plane the surface of an object. It is on the basis of a
something that geometrical notions impose themselves. They are experi-
mental "notions" not because they would be contrary to reason, but
because they become objects of view only on the basis of things: they are
limits of things. But illuminated space involves the attenuation of these
limits unto nothingness, their vanishing. Considered in itself, illumi-
nated space, emptied by light of the obscurity that filled it, is nothing.
To be sure, this void is not equivalent to absolute nothingness; to
traverse it is not equivalent to transcending. But if empty space differs
from nothingness, and if the distance it opens does not justify a claim to
transcendence in the movement that traverses it, yet its "plenitude"
nowise returns it to the status of an object. This "plenitude" is of
another order. If the void that light produces in the space from which it
drives out darkness is not equivalent to nothingness, even in the absence
of any particular object, there is this void itself. It does not exist by
virtue of a play on words. The negation of every qualifiable thing
allows the impersonal there is to arise again, returning intact behind
every negation, whatever be the degree of negation. The silence of
infinite spaces is terrifying. The invasion of this there is does not
correspond to any representation. We have described elsewhere its
vertigo.• And the elemental essence of the element, with the mythical
facelessness from which it comes, participates in the same vertigo.
In driving out darkness the light does not arrest the incessant play
of the there is. The void the light produces remains an indeterminate
density which has no meaning of itself prior to discourse, and does not
yet triumph over the return of mythical gods. But vision in the light
is precisely the possibility of forgetting the horror of this interminable

*Existence and Existents, trans. A. F. Lingis, The Hague, Nijhoff, 1978, pp. 57-64.-Trans.
A. Sensibility and the Face                         191
return, this aperion, maintaining oneself before this semblance of
nothingness which is the void, and approaching objects as though at their
origin, out of nothingness. This deliverance from the horror of the there
is is evinced in the contentment of enjoyment. The void of space is not
the absolute interval from which the absolutely exterior being can arise.
It is a modality of enjoyment and separation.
Illuminated space is not the absolute interval. The connection be-
tween vision and touch, between representation and labor, remains essen-
tial. Vision moves into grasp. Vision opens upon a perspective, upon a
horizon, and describes a traversable distance, invites the hand to move-
ment and to contact, and ensures them. Socrates made fun of Glaucon
who wished to take the vision of the starlit sky for an experience of
height. The forms of objects call for the hand and the grasp. By the
hand the object is in the end comprehended, touched, taken, borne and
referred to other objects, clothed with a signification, by reference to
other objects.• Empty space is the condition for this relationship; it is
not a breach of the horizon. Vision is not a transcendence. It ascribes a
signification by the relation it makes possible. It opens nothing that,
beyond the same, would be absolutely other, that is, in itself. Light
conditions the relations between data; it makes possible the signification
of objects that border one another. It does not enable one to approach
them face to face. Intuition, taken in this very general sense, is not
opposed to the thought of relations. It is already relationship, since it is
vision; it catches sight of the space across which things are transported
toward one another. Space, instead of transporting beyond, simply
ensures the condition for the lateral signification of things within the
same.
To see is hence always to see on the horizon. The vision that
apprehends on the horizon does not encounter a being out of what is
beyond all being. Vision is a forgetting of the there is because of the
essential satisfaction, the agreeableness [agrement] of sensibility, enjoy-
ment, contentment with the finite without concern for the infinite. In
fleeing itself in vision consciousness returns to itself.
But is not light in another sense origin of itself-as the source of light,
in which its being and its appearing coincide, as fire and as sun? Here,
to be sure, is the figure of every relation with the absolute. But it is only

• "Par la main, l'objet est en fin de compte compris, touche, pris, porte et
rajjorll ad'autres objets, revet une 1ignification, par rapport A d'autres objeta."
192                       Totality and Infinity
a figure. The light as sun is an object. If in the diurnal vision light
makes seen and is not seen, the nocturnal light is seen as source of light.
In the vision of brilliancy the juncture of light with object takes place.
The sensible light qua visual datum does not differ from other data, and
itself remains relative to an elemental and obscure ground. A relation
with what in another sense comes absolutely from itself is needed to make
possible the consciousness of radical exteriority. A light is needed to see
the light.
Does not science make possible the transcending of the subjective
condition of sensibility? Even if we distinguish from qualitative science
that which the work of Leon Brunschvicg extolled, we can still ask
whether mathematical thought itself breaks with sensation? The phe-
nomenological message essentially answers in the negative. The realities
physico-mathematical science reach derive their meaning from procedures
that proceed from the sensible.
Total alterity, in which a being does not refer to enjoyment and pre-
sents itself out of itself, does not shine forth in the form by which
things are given to us, for beneath form things conceal themselves. The
surface can be transformed into an interior: one can melt the metal of
things to make new objects of them, utilize the wood of a box to make a
table out of it by chopping, sawing, planing: the hidden becomes open
and the open becomes hidden. This consideration may seem naive-as
though the interiority or the essence of the thing which the form hides
would have to be taken in the spatial sense. But in fact the depth of the
thing can have no other meaning than that of its matter, and the revela-
tion of matter is essentially superficial.
It would seem that between the different surfaces there exists a more
profound difference: that of the obverse and the reverse. One surface is
offered to the gaze, and one can turn over the garment, as one remints a
coin. But does not the distinction between the obverse and the reverse
bring us beyond these superficial considerations? Does it not indicate to
us another plane than that with which our last remarks were intention-
ally concerned? The obverse would be the essence of the thing whose
servitudes are supported by the reverse, where the threads are invisible.
Yet Proust admired the reverse of the sleeves of a lady's gown, like those
dark corners of cathedrals, nonetheless worked with the same art as the
fa-;ade. It is art that endows things with something like a fa,ade-that
by which objects are not only seen, but are as objects on exhibition. The
darkness of matter would denote the state of a being that precisely
A. Sensibility and the Face                      193
has no fac;ade. The notion of fac;ade borrowed from building suggests to
us that architecture is perhaps the first of the fine arts. But in it is con-
stituted the beautiful, whose essence is indifference, cold splendor,
and silence. By the fac;ade the thing which keeps its secret is exposed
enclosed in its monumental essence and in its myth, in which it gleams
like a splendor but does not deliver itself. It captivates by its grace as by
magic, but does not reveal itself. If the transcendent cuts across sensibil-
ity, if it is openness preeminently, if its vision is the vision of the very
openness of being, it cuts across the vision of forms and can be stated
neither in terms of contemplation nor in terms of practice. It is the
face; its revelation is speech. The relation with the Other alone intro-
duces a dimension of transcendence, and leads us to a relation totally
different from experience in the sensible sense of the term, relative and
egoist.
## B. Ethics And The Face


1. Infinity and the Face
Inasmuch as the access to beings concerns vision, it dominates those
beings, exercises a power over them. A thing is given, offers itself to
me. In gaining access to it I maintain myself within the same.
The face is present in its refusal to be contained. In this sense it can-
not be comprehended, that is, encompassed. It is neither seen nor
touched-for in visual or tactile sensation the identity of the I envelops
the alterity of the object, which becomes precisely a content.
The Other is not other with a relative alterity as are, in a comparison,
even ultimate species, which mutually exclude one another but still have
their place within the community of a genus--excluding one another by
their definition, but calling for one another by this exclusion, across the
community of their genus. The alterity of the Other does not depend on
any quality that would distinguish him from me, for a distinction of this
nature would precisely imply between us that community of genus which
already nullifies al terity.
And yet the Other does not purely and simply negate the I; total
negation, of which mt..rder is the temptation and the attempt, refers to an
antecedent relation. The relation between the Other and me, which
dawns forth in his expression, issues neither in number nor in concept.
The Other remains infinitely transcendent, infinitely foreign; his face in
which his epiphany is produced and which appeals to me breaks with the
world that can be common to us, whose virtualities are inscribed in our
nature and developed by our existence. Speech proceeds from absolute
difference. Or, more exactly, an absolute difference is not produced in a
process of specification descending from genus to species, in which the
order of logical relations runs up against the given, which is not reduci·
ble to relations. The difference thus encountered remains bound up with
the logical hierarchy it contrasts with, and appears against the ground of
the common genus.
194
B. Ethics and the Face                         195
Absolute difference, inconceivable in terms of formal logic, is estab-
lished only by language. Language accomplishes a relation between
terms that breaks up the unity of a genus. The terms, the interlocutors,
absolve themselves from the relation, or remain absolute within relation-
ship. Language is perhaps to be defined as the very power to break the
continuity of being or of history.
The incomprehensible nature of the presence of the Other, which we
spoke of above, is not to be described negatively. Better than compre-
hension, discourse relates with what remains essentially transcendent.
For the moment we must attend to the formal work of language, which
consists in presenting the transcendent; a more profound signification
will emerge shortly. Language is a relation between separated terms.
To the one the other can indeed present himself as a theme, but his
presence is not reabsorbed in his status as a theme. The word that bears
on the Other as a theme seems to contain the Other. But alreadv it isJ

said to the Other who, as interlocutor, has quit the theme that encom-
passed him, and upsurges inevitably behind the said. Words are said,
be it only by the silence kept, whose weight acknowledges this evasion of
the Other. The knowledge that absorbs the Other is forthwith situated
within the discourse I address to him. Speaking, rather than "letting
be," solicits the Other. Speech cuts across vision. In knowledge or vi-
sion the object seen can indeed determine an act, but it is an act that in
some way appropriates the "seen" to itself, integrates it into a world by
endowing it with a signification, and, in the last analysis, constitutes it.
In discourse the divergence that inevitably opens between the Other
as my theme and the Other as my interlocutor, emancipated from the
theme that seemed a moment to hold him, forthwith contests the meaning
I ascribe to my interlocutor. The formal structure of language thereby
announces the ethical inviolability of the Other and, without any odor of
the "numinous," his "holiness."
The fact that the face maintains a relation with me by discourse does
not range him in the same; he remains absolute within the relation.
The solipsist dialectic of consciousness always suspicious of being in cap-
tivity in the same breaks off. For the ethical relationship which subtends
discourse is not a species of consciousness whose ray emanates from the I;
it puts the I in question. This putting in question emanates from the
other.
The presence of a being not entering into, but overflowing, the sphere
of the same determines its "status" as infinite. This overflowing
196                        Totality and Infinity
is to be distinguished from the image of liquid overflowing a vessel,
because this overflowing presence is effectuated as a position in face of the
same. The facing position, opposition par excellence, can be only as a
moral summons. This movement proceeds from the other. The idea of
infinity, the infinitely more contained in the less, is concretely produced
in the form of a relation with the face. And the idea of infinity alone
maintains the exteriority of the other with respect to the same, despite
this relation. Thus a structure analogous to the ontological argument is
here produced: the exteriority of a being is inscribed in its essence. But
what is produced here is not a reasoning, but the epiphany that occurs as
a face. The metaphysical desire for the absolutely other which animates
intellectualism ( or the radical empiricism that confides in the teaching
of exteriority) deploys its en-ergy in the vision of the face [ vision du
visage], or in the idea of infinity. The idea of infinity exceeds my powers
(not quantitatively, but, we will see later, by calling them into question);
it does not come from our a priori depths-it is consequently experience
par excellence.
The Kantian notion of infinity figures as an ideal of reason, the
projection of its exigencies in a beyond, the ideal completion of what
is given incomplete-but without the incomplete being confronted with
a privileged experience of infinity, without it drawing the limits of its
finitude from such a confrontation. The finite is here no longer
conceived by relation to the infinite; quite the contrary, the infinite
presupposes the finite, which it amplifies infinitely (although this passage
to the limit or this projection implicates in an unacknowledged form the
idea of infinity, with all the consequences Descartes drew from it, and
which are presupposed in this idea of projection). The Kantian finitude
is described positively by sensibility, as the Heideggerian finitude by
the being for death. This infinity referring to the finite marks the most
anti-Cartesian point of Kantian philosophy as, later, of Heideggerian
philosophy.
Hegel returns to Descartes in maintaining the positivity of the infi-
nite, but excluding all multiplicity from it; he posits the infinite as the
exclusion of every "other" that might maintain a relation with the
infinite and thereby limit it. The infinite can only encompass all rela-
tions. Like the god of Aristotle it refers only to itself, though now at the
term of a history. The relation of a particular with infinity would be
equivalent to the entry of this particular into the sovereignty of a
State. It becomes infinite in negating its own finitude. But this out-
B. Ethics and the Face                         197
come does not succeed in smothering the protestation of the private
individual, the apology of the separated being ( though it be called
empirical and animal), of the individual who experiences as a tyranny
the State willed by his reason, but in whose impersonal destiny he no
longer recognizes his reason. We recognize in the finitude to which
the Hegelian infinite is opposed, and which it encompasses, the finitude
of man before the elements, the finitude of man invaded by the there is,
at each instant traversed by faceless gods against whom labor is pursued in
order to realize the security in which the "other" of the elements
would be revealed as the same. But the other absolutely other
-the Other-does not limit the freedom of the same; calling it to
responsibility, it founds it and justifies it. The relation with the other as
face heals allergy. It is desire, teaching received, and the pacific
opposition of discourse. In returning to the Cartesian notion of infinity,
the "idea of infinity" put in the separated being by the infinite, we
retain its positivity, its anteriority to every finite thought and every
thought of the finite, its exteriority with regard to the finite; here there
was the possibility of separated being. The idea of infinity, the overflow-
ing of finite thought by its content, effectuates the relation of thought
with what exceeds its capacity, with what at each moment it learns
without suffering shock. This is the situation we call welcome of the
face. The idea of infinity is produced in the opposition of conversation,
in sociality. The relation with the face, with the other absolutely other
which I can not contain, the other in this sense infinite, is nonethe-
less my Idea, a commerce. But the relation is maintained without
violence, in peace with this absolute alterity. The "resistance" of the
other does not do violence to me, does not act negatively; it has a positive
structure: ethical. The first revelation of the other, presupposed in all
the other relations with him, does not consist in grasping him in his
negative resistance and in circumventing him by ruse. I do not struggle
with a faceless god, but I respond to his expression, to his revelation.


2. Ethics and the Face
The face resists possession, resists my powers. In its epiphany, in
expression, the sensible, still graspable, turns into total resistance to the
grasp. This mutation can occur only by the opening of a new dimension.
For the resistance to the grasp is not produced as an insurmountable
resistance, like the hardness of the rock against which the effort of the
198                        Totality and Infinity
hand comes to naught, like the remoteness of a star in the immensity of
space. The expression the face introduces into the world does not defy
the feebleness of my powers, but my ability for power.* The face, still a
thing among things, breaks through the form that nevertheless delimits
it. This means concretely: the face speaks to me and thereby invites me
to a relation incommensurate with a power exercised, be it enjoyment or
knowledge.
And yet this new dimension opens in the sensible appearance of the
face. The permanent openness of the contours of its form in expression
imprisons this openness which breaks up form in a caricature. The face
at the limit of holiness and caricature is thus still in a sense exposed to
powers. In a sense only: the depth that opens in this sensibility modifies
the very nature of power, which henceforth can no longer take, but can
kill. Murder still aims at a sensible datum, and yet it finds itself before
a datum whose being can not be suspended by an appropriation. It finds
itself before a datum absolutely non-neutralizable. The "negation"
effected by appropriation and usage remained always partial. The grasp
that contests the independence of the thing preserves it "for me."
Neither the destruction of things, nor the hunt, nor the extermination of
living beings aims at the face, which is not of the world. They still
belong to labor, have a finality, and answer to a need. Murder alone
lays claim to total negation. Negation by labor and usage, like negation
by representation, effect a grasp or a comprehension, rest on or aim at
affirmation; they can. To kill is not to dominate but to annihilate; it is
to renounce comprehension absolutely. Murder exercises a power over
what escapes power. It is still a power, for the face expresses itself in the
sensible, but already impotency, because the face rends the sensible. The
alterity that is expressed in the face provides the unique "matter" possible
for total negation. I can wish to kill only an existent absolutely inde-
pendent, which exceeds my powers infinitely, and therefore does not op-
pose them but paralyzes the very power of power. The Other is the sole
being I can wish to kill.
But how does this disproportion between infinity and my powers differ
from that which separates a very great obstacle from a force applied to
it? It would be pointless to insist on the banality of murder, which
reveals the quasi-null resistance of the obstacle. This most banal inci-
dent of human history corresponds to an exceptional possibility-since it

• "Mon pouvoir de pouvoir."
B. Ethics and the Face                         199
claims the total negation of a being. It does not concern the force that
this being may possess as a part of the world. The Other who can
sovereignly say no to me is exposed to the point of the sword or the
revolver's bullet, and the whole unshakeable firmness of his "for itself"
with that intransigent no he opposes is obliterated because the sword or
the bullet has touched the ventricles or auricles of his heart. In the
contexture of the world he is a quasi-nothing. But he can oppose to me a
struggle, that is, oppose to the force that strikes him not a force of
resistance, but the very unforeseeableness of his reaction. He thus
opposes to me not a greater force, an energy assessable and consequently
presenting itself as though it were part of a whole, but the very tran-
scendence of his being by relation to that whole; not some superlative of
power, but precisely the infinity of his transcendence. This infinity,
stronger than murder, already resists us in his face, is his face, is the
primordial expression, is the first word: "you shall not commit murder."
The infinite paralyses power by its infinite resistance to murder, which,
firm and insurmountable, gleams in the face of the Other, in the total
nudity of his defenceless eyes, in the nudity of the absolute openness of
the Transcendent. There is here a relation not with a very great
resistance, but with something absolutely other: the resistance of what
has no resistance-the ethical resistance. The epiphany of the face
brings forth the possibility of gauging the infinity of the temptation
to murder, not only as a temptation to total destruction, but also as the
purely ethical impossibility of this temptation and attempt. If the resist-
ance to murder were not ethical but real, we would have a percep-
tion of it, with all that reverts to the subjective in perception. We
would remain within the idealism of a consciousness of struggle, and not
in relationship with the Other, a relationship that can turn into struggle,
but already overflows the consciousness of struggle. The epiphany of
the face is ethical. The struggle this face can threaten presupposes the
transcendence of expression. The face threatens the eventuality of a
struggle, but this threat does not exhaust the epiphany of infinity, does
not formulate its first word. War presupposes peace, the antecedent and
non-allergic presence of the Other; it does not represent the first event of
the encounter.
The impossibility of killing does not have a simply negative and formal
signification; the relation with infinity, the idea of infinity in us, condi-
tions it positively. Infinity presents itself as a face in the ethical resist-
ance that paralyses my powers and from the depths of defenceless eyes
200                        Totality and Infinity
rises firm and absolute in its nudity and destitution. The comprehension
of this destitution and this hunger establishes the very proximity of the
other. But thus the epiphany of infinity is expression and discourse.
The primordial essence of expression and discourse does not reside in the
information they would supply concerning an interior and hidden world.
In expression a being presents itself; the being that manifests itself
attends its manifestation and consequently appeals to me. This attend-
ance is not the neutrality [le neutre] of an image, hut a solicitation that
concerns me by its destitution and its Height. To speak to me is at each
moment to surmount what is necessarily plastic in manifestation. To
manifest oneself as a face is to impose onself above and beyond the mani-
fested and purely phenomenal form, to present oneself in a mode irreduci-
ble to manifestation, the very straightforwardness of the face to face,
without the intermediary of any image, in one's nudity, that is, in one's
destitution and hunger. In Desire are conjoined the movements unto the
Height and unto the Humility of the Other.
Expression does not radiate as a splendor that spreads unbeknown to
the radiating being-which is perhaps the definition of beauty. To
manifest oneself in attending one's own manifestation is to invoke the
interlocutor and expose oneself to his response and his questioning.
Expression does not impose itself as a true representation or as an
action. The being offered in true representation remains a possibility
of appearance. The world which invades me when I engage myself in it
is powerless against the "free thought,. that suspends that engagement, or
even refuses it interiorly, being capable of living hidden. The being that
expresses itself imposes itself, but does so precisely by appealing to me
with its destitution and nudity-its hunger-without my being able to be
deaf to that appeal. Thus in expression the being that imposes itself does
not limit but promotes my freedom, by arousing my goodness. The
order of responsibility, where the gravity of ineluctable being freezes all
laughter, is also the order where freedom is ineluctably invoked. It is
thus the irremissible weight of being that gives rise to my freedom. The
ineluctable has no longer the inhumanity of the fateful, but the severe
seriousness of goodness.
This bond between expression and responsibility, this ethical condition
or essence of language, this function of language prior to all disclosure of
being and its cold splendor, permits us to extract language from subjec-
tion to a preexistent thought, where it would have but the servile
function of translating that preexistent thought on the outside, or of
B. Ethics and the Face                         201
universalizing its interior movements. The presentation of the face is
not true, for the true refers to the non-true, its eternal contemporary,
and ineluctably meets with the smile and silence of the skeptic. The
presentation of being in the face does not leave any logical place for its
contradictory. Thus I cannot evade by silence the discourse which
the epiphany that occurs as a face opens, as Thrasymachus, irritated, tries
to do, in the first book of the Republic (moreover without succeeding).
"To leave men without food is a fault that no circumstance attenuates;
the distinction between the voluntary and the involuntary does not apply
here," says Rabbi Yochanan.1 Before the hunger of men responsibility is
measured only "objectively"; it is irrecusable. The face opens the
primordial discourse whose first word is obligation, which no "interior-
ity" permits avoiding. It is that discourse that obliges the entering into
discourse, the commencement of discourse rationalism prays for, a
"force" that convinces even "the people who do not wish to listen" 2 and
thus founds the true universality of reason.
Preexisting the disclosure of being in general taken as basis of knowl-
edge and as meaning of being is the relation with the existent that
expresses himself; preexisting the plane of ontology is the ethical plane.


3. Reason and the Face
Expression is not produced as the manifestation of an intelligible form
that would connect terms to one another so as to establish, across
distance, the assemblage of parts in a totality, in which the terms joined
up already derive their meaning from the situation created by their com-
munity, which, in its turn, owes its meaning to the terms combined. This
"circle of understanding" is not the primordial event of the logic of being.
Expression precedes these coordinating effects visible to a third party.
The event proper to expression consists in bearing witness to oneself,
and guaranteeing this witness. This attestation of oneself is possible
only as a face, that is, as speech. It produces the commencement of
intelligibility, initiality itself, principality, royal sovereignty, which com-
mands unconditionally. The principle is possible only as command. A
search for the influence that expression would have undergone or an
unconscious source from which it would emanate would presuppose

1 Treatise Synludrin, 104 b.
2 Plato, Republic, 327 b.
202                        Totality and Infinity
an inquiry that would refer to new testimonies, and consequently to an
original sincerity of an expression.
Language as an exchange of ideas about the world, with the mental
reservations it involves, across the vicissitudes of sincerity and deceit it
delineates, presupposes the originality of the face without which, reduced
to an action among actions whose meaning would require an infinite
psychoanalysis or sociology, it could not commence. If at the bottom of
speech there did not subsist this originality of expression, this break with
every influence, this dominant position of the speaker foreign to all
compromise and all contamination, this straightforwardness of the face
to face, speech would not surpass the plane of activity, of which it is
evidently not a species--even though language can be integrated into a
system of acts and serve as an instrument. But language is possible only
when speaking precisely renounces this function of being action and
returns to its essence of being expression.
Expression does not consist in giving us the Other's interiority. The
Other who expresses himself precisely does not give himself, and accord-
ingly retains the freedom to lie. But deceit and veracity already presup-
pose the absolute authenticity of the face-the privileged case of a
presentation of being foreign to the alternative of truth and non-truth,
circumventing the ambiguity of the true and the false which every truth
risks-an ambiguity, moreover, in which all values move. The presenta-
tion of being in the face does not have the status of a value. What we
call the face is precisely this exceptional presentation of self by self, in-
commensurable with the presentation of realities simply given, always
suspect of some swindle, always possibly dreamt up. To seek truth I
have already established a relationship with a face which can guarantee
itself, whose epiphany itself is somehow a word of honor. Every lan-
guage as an exchange of verbal signs refers already to this primordial
word of honor. The verbal sign is placed where someone signifies some-
thing to someone else. It therefore already presupposes an authentifica-
tion of the signifier.
The ethical relation, the face to face, also cuts across every relation
one could call mystical, where events other than that of the presentation
of the original being come to overwhelm or sublimate the pure sincerity
of this presentation, where intoxicating equivocations come to enrich the
primordial univocity of expression, where discourse becomes incantation
as prayer becomes rite and liturgy, where the interlocutors find them-
selves playing a role in a drama that has begun outside of them. Here
B. Ethics and the Face                        203
resides the rational character of the ethical relation and of language. No
fear, no trembling could alter the straightforwardness of this relation-
ship, which preserves the discontinuity of relationship, resists fusion, and
where the response does not evade the question. To poetic activity-
where influences arise unbeknown to us out of this nonetheless conscious
activity, to envelop it and beguile it as a rhythm, and where action is
borne along by the very work it has given rise to, where in a dionysiac
mode the artist (according to Nietzsche's expression) becomes a work of
art-is opposed the language that at each instant dispels the charm
of rhythm and prevents the initiative from becoming a role. Discourse is
rupture and commencement, breaking of rhythm which enraptures and
transports the interlocutors-prose.
The face in which the other-the absolutely other-presents himself
does not negate the same, does not do violence to it as do opinion or
authority or the thaumaturgic supernatural. It remains commensurate
with him who welcomes; it remains terrestrial. This presentation is
preeminently nonviolence, for instead of offending my freedom it calls
it to responsibility and founds it. As nonviolence it nonetheless main-
tains the plurality of the same and the other. It is peace. The relation
with the other-the absolutely other-who has no frontier with the same
is not exposed to the allergy that afflicts the same in a totality, upon
which the Hegelian dialectic rests. The other is not for reason a scandal
which launches it into dialectical movement, but the first rational teach-
ing, the condition for all teaching. The alleged scandal of alterity
presupposes the tranquil identity of the same, a freedom sure of itself
which is exercised without scruples, and to whom the foreigner brings
only constraint and limitation. This flawless identity freed from all
participation, independent in the I, can nonetheless lose its tranquillity if
the other, rather than countering it by upsurging on the same plane as it,
speaks to it, that is, shows himself in expression, in the face, and comes
from on high. Freedom then is inhibited, not as countered by a resist-
ance, but as arbitrary, guilty, and timid; but in its guilt it rises to
responsibility. Contingency, that is, the irrational, appears to it not
outside of itself in the other, but within itself. It is not limitation by the
other that constitutes contingency, but egoism, as unjustified of itself.
The relation with the Other as a relation with his transcendence-the
relation with the Other who puts into question the brutal spontaneity of
one's immanent destiny-introduces into me what was not in me. But
this "action" upon my freedom precisely puts an end to violence
204                        Totality and Infinity
and contingency, and, in this sense also, founds Reason. To affirm that
the passage of a content from one mind to the other is produced without
violence only if the truth taught by the master is from all eternity in the
student is to extrapolate maieutics beyond its legitimate usage. The idea
of infinity in me, implying a content overflowing the container, breaks
with the prejudice of maieutics without breaking with rationalism, since
the idea of infinity, far from violating the mind, conditions nonviolence
itself, that is, establishes ethics. The other is not for reason a scandal
that puts it in dialectical movement, but the first teaching. A being
receiving the idea of Infinity, receiving since it cannot derive it from
itself, is a being taught in a non-maieutic fashion, a being whose very
existing consists in this incessant reception of teaching, in this incessant
overflowing of self ( which is time). To think is to have the idea of
infinity, or to be taught. Rational thought refers to this teaching. Even
if we confine ourselves to the formal structure of logical thought, which
starts from a definition, infinity, relative to which concepts are delimited,
can not be defined in its turn. It accordingly refers to a "knowledge" of
a new structure. We seek to fix it as a relation with the face and to show
the ethical essence of this relation. The face is the evidence that makes
evidence possibl~like the divine veracity that sustains Cartesian ration-
alism.

4. Discourse Founds Signification
Language thus conditions the functioning of rational thought: it gives
it a commencement in being, a primary identity of signification in the
face of him who speaks, that is, who presents himself by ceaselessly
undoing the equivocation of his own image, his verbal signs.
Language conditions thought-not language in its physical materiality,
but language as an attitude of the same with regard to the Other
irreducible to the representation of the Other, irreducible to an intention
of thought, irreducible to a consciousness of . . . , since relating to what
no consciousness can contain, relating to the infinity of the Other.
Language is not enacted within a consciousness; it comes to me from the
Other and reverberates in consciousness by putting it in question. This
event is irreducible to consciousness, where everything comes about from
within-even the strangeness of suffering. To regard language as an
attitude of the mind does not amount to disincarnating it, but is precisely
to account for its incarnate essence, its difference from the constitutive,
B. Ethics and the Face                        205
egological nature of the transcendental thought of idealism. The origi-
nality of discourse with respect to constitutive intentionality, to pure
consciousness, destroys the concept of immanence: the idea of in-
finity in consciousness is an overflowing of a consciousness whose
incarnation offers new powers to a soul no long paralytic-powers of
welcome, of gift, of full hands, of hospitality. But to take incarnation as
a primary fact of language, without indicating the ontological structure
it accomplishes, would be to assimilate language to activity, to that
prolongation of thought in corporeity, the I think in the I can, which has
indeed served as a prototype for the category of the lived body [ corps
propre] or incarnate thought, which dominates one part of contemporary
philosophy. The thesis we present here separates radically language and
activity, expression and labor, in spite of all the practical side of lan-
guage, whose importance we may not underestimate.
Until very recently the fundamental function of discourse in the
upsurge of reason was not recognized. The function of words was
understood in their dependence on reason: words reflected thought.
N ominalism was the first to seek in words another function : that of an
instrument of reason. A symbolic function of the word symbolizing the
non-thinkable rather than signifying thought contents, this symbolism
amounted to association with a certain number of conscious, intuitive
data, an association that would be self-sufficient and would not require
thought. The theory had no other purpose than to explain a divergence
between thought, incapable of aiming at a general object, and language,
which does seem to refer to general objects. Husserl's critique, com-
pletely subordinating words to reason, showed this divergency to be
only apparent. The word is a window; if it forms a screen it must be
rejected. With Heidegger Husserl's esperantist words take on the color
and weight of a historical reality. But they remain bound to the process
of comprehension.
The mistrust of verbalism leads to the incontestable primacy of ra-
tional thought over all the operations of expression that insert a thought
into a particular language as into a system of signs, or bind it to a system
of language presiding over the choice of these signs. Modern investiga-
tions in the philosophy of language have made familiar the idea of an un-
derlying solidarity of thought with speech. Merleau-Ponty, among
others, and better than others, showed that disincarnate thought thinking
speech before speaking it, thought constituting the world of speech,
adding a world of speech to the world antecedently constituted out of
206                        Totality and Infinity
significations in an always transcendental operation, was a myth.
Already thought consists in foraging in the system of signs, in the
particular tongue of a people or civilization, and receiving signification
from this very operation. It ventures forth at random, inasmuch as it
does not start with an antecedent representation, or with those significa-
tions, or with phrases to be articulated. Hence one might say thought
operates in the "I can" of the body. It operates in it before representing
this body to itself or constituting it. Signification surprises the very
thought that thought it.
But why is language, the recourse to the system of signs, necessary for
thought? Why does the object, and even the perceived object, need a
name in order to become a signification? What is it to have a meaning?
Signification, though received from this incarnate language, nonetheless
remains, thoughout this conception, an "intentional object." The struc-
ture of constitutive consciousness recovers all its rights after the media-
tion of the body that speaks or writes. Does not the surplus of signifi-
cation over representation consist in a new mode of being presented ( new
with respect to constitutive intentionality), whose secret the analysis of
"body intentionality" does not exhaust? Does the mediation of the
sign constitute the signification because it would introduce into an
objective and static representation the "movement" of symbolic
relation? But then language would again be suspected of taking us away
from "the thing themselves.". . .
It is the contrary that must be affirmed; it is not the mediation
of the sign that forms signification, but signification ( whose primordial
event is the face to face) that makes the sign function possible. The
primordial essence of language is to be sought not in the corporeal
operation that discloses it to me and to others and, in the recourse to
language, builds up a thought, but in the presentation of meaning.
This does not bring us back to a transcendental consciousness con-
stituting objects, against which the theory of language we have just
evoked protests with such just rigor. For significations do not present
themselves to theory, that is, to the constitutive freedom of a transcend-
ental consciousness; the being of signification consists in putting into
question in an ethical relation constitutive freedom itself. Meaning is the
face of the Other, and all recourse to words takes place already within
the primordial face to face of language. Every recourse to words
presupposes the comprehension of the primary signification, but this
comprehension, before being interpreted as a "consciousness of.'' is society
B. Ethics and the Face                         207
and obligation. Signification is the Infinite, but infinity does not present
itself to a transcendental thought, nor even to meaningful activity, but
presents itself in the Other; the Other faces me and puts me in question
and obliges me by his essence qua infinity. That "something" we call
signification arises in being with language because the essence of language
is the relation with the Other. This relation is not added to the interior
monologue-be it Merleau-Ponty's "corporeal intentionality"-like an
address added to the fabricated object one puts in the mailbox; the
welcoming of the being that appears in the face, the ethical event of
sociality, already commands inward discourse. And the epiphany
that is produced as a face is not constituted as are all other beings,
precisely because it "reveals" infinity. Signification is infinity, that is,
the Other. The intelligible is not a concept, but an intelligence.
Signification precedes Sinngebung, and rather than justifying idealism,
marks its limit.
In a sense signification is to perception what the symbol is to the object
symbolized. The symbol marks the inadequateness of what is given in
consciousness with regard to the being it symbolizes, a consciousness
needy and hungry for the being it lacks, for the being announced in the
very precision with which its absence is lived, a potency that evinces the
act. Signification resembles it, as an overflowing of the intention that
envisages by the being envisaged. But here the inexhaustible surplus of
infinity overflows the actuality of consciousness. The shimmer of infin-
ity, the face, can no longer be stated in terms of consciousness, in
metaphors referring to light and the sensible. It is the ethical exigency
of the face, which puts into question the consciousness that welcomes it.
The consciousness of obligation is no longer a consciousness, since it tears
consciousness up from its center, submitting it to the Other.
If the face to face founds language, if the face brings the first
signification, establishes signification itself in being, then language does
not only serve reason, but is reason. Reason in the sense of an imper-
sonal legality does not permit us to account for discourse, for it absorbs
the plurality of the interlocutors. Reason, being unique, cannot speak to
another reason. A reason immanent in an individual consciousness is, to
be sure, conceivable, in the way of naturalism, as a system of laws that
regulate the nature of this consciousness, individuated like all natural
beings but in addition individuated also as oneself. The concordance
between consciousnesses would then be explained by the resemblance of
beings constituted in the same fashion. Language would be reduced to a
208                         Totality and Infinity
system of signs awakening, from one consciousness to the other, like
thoughts. In that case one must disregard the intentionality of rational
thought, which opens upon a universal order, and run all the risks of
naturalist psychologism, against which the arguments of the first volume
of the Logische Untersuchungen are ever valid.
Retreating from these consequences, and in order to conform oneself
more to the "phenomenon," one can call reason the internal coherence of
an ideal order realized in being in the measure that the individual
consciousness, in which it is learnt or set up, would renounce its particu-
larity as an individual and an ipseity, and either withdraw unto a
noumenal sphere, from which it would exercise intemporally its role as
absolute subject in the I think, or be reabsorbed in the universal order of
the State, which at first it seemed to foresee or constitute. In both
cases the role of language would be to dissolve the ipseity of individ-
ual consciousness, fundamentally antagonistic to reason, either to trans-
form it into an "I think" which no longer speaks, or to make it disappear
into its own discourse, whereupon, having entered into the State, it could
only undergo the judgment of history, rather than remain me, that is,
judge that history.
In such a rationalism there is no longer any society, that is, no
longer any relation whose terms absolve themselves from the relation.
The Hegelians may attribute to human animality the consciousness of
tyranny the individual feels before impersonal law, but they have yet to
make understandable how a rational animal is possible, how the particu-
larity of oneself can be affected by the simple universality of an idea, how
an egoism can abdicate?
If, on the contrary, reason lives in language, if the first rationality
gleams forth in the opposition of the face to face, if the first intelligible,
the first signification, is the infinity of the intelligence that presents itself
( that is, speaks to me) in the face, if reason is defined by significa-
tion rather than signification being defined by the impersonal structures
of reason, if society precedes the apparition of these impersonal struc-
tures, if universality reigns as the presence of humanity in the eyes that
look at me, if, finally, we recall that this look appeals to my responsibility
and consecrates my freedom as responsibility and gift of self-then the
pluralism of society could not disappear in the elevation to reason, but
would be its condition. It is not the impersonal in me that Reason
would establish, but an I myself capable of society, an I that has arisen in

enjoyment as separated, but whose separation would itself be necessary
for infinity to be-for its infinitude is accomplished as the "facing."


5. Language and Objectivity
A meaningful world is a world in which there is the Other through
whom the world of my enjoyment becomes a theme having a significa-
tion. Things acquire a rational signification, and not only one of simple
usage, because an other is associated with my relations with them. In
designating a thing I designate it to the Other. The act of designating
modifies my relation of enjoyment and possession with things, places the
things in the perspective of the Other. Utilizing a sign is therefore not
limited to substituting an indirect relation for the direct relation with a
thing, but permits me to render the things offerable, detach them from
my own usage, alienate them, render them exterior. The word that
designates things attests their apportionment between me and the
others. The objectivity of the object does not follow from a suspension
of usage and enjoyment, in which I possess things without assuming
them. Objectivity results from language, which permits the putting into
question of possession. This disengagement has a positive meaning: the
entry of the thing into the sphere of the other. The thing becomes a
theme. To thematize is to oHer the world to the Other in speech.
"Distance" with regard to the object thus exceeds its spatial signification.
This objectivity is correlative not of some trait in an isolated subject,
but of his relation with the Other. Objectification is produced in the
very work of language, where the subject is detached from the things
possessed as though it hovered over its own existence, as though it were
detached from it, as though the existnece it exists had not yet completely
reached it. This distance is more radical than every distance in the
world. The subject must find itself "at a distance" from its own
being, even with regard to that taking distance that is inherent in the
home, by which it is still in being. For negation remains within the
totality, even when it bears upon the totality of the world. In order
that objective distance be hollowed out, it is necessary that while in being
the subject be not yet in being, that in a certain sense it be not yet
born-that it not be in nature. If the subject capable of objectivity
is not yet completely, this "not yet," this state of potency relative to act,
does not denote a less than being, but denotes time. Consciousness of the
210                        Totality and Infinity
object-thematization-rests on distance with regard to oneself, which
can only be time; or, if one prefers, it rests on self-consciousness, if we
recognize the "distance from self to self" in self-consciousness to be
"time." However, time can designate a "not yet" that nevertheless
would not be a "lesser being"-it can remain distant both from being
and from death--only as the inexhaustible future of infinity, that is, as
what is produced in the very relationship of language. In designating
what it possesses to the other, in speaking, the subject hovers over its
own existence. But it is from the welcoming of the infinity of the other
that it receives the freedom with regard to itself that this dispossession
requires. It detains it finally from the Desire which does not arise from
a lack or a limitation but from a surplus, from the idea of Infinity.
Language makes possible the objectivity of objects and their themati-
zation. Already Husserl affirmed that the objectivity of thought consists
in being valid for everyone. To know objectively would therefore be to
constitute my thought in such a way that it already contained a reference
to the thought of the others. What I communicate therefore is already
constituted in function of others. In speaking I do not transmit to the
Other what is objective for me: the objective becomes objective only
through communication. But in Husserl the Other who makes this com-
munication possible is first constituted for a monadic thought. The basis
of objectivity is constituted in a purely subjective process. In positing
the relation with the Other as ethical, one surmounts a difficulty that
would be inevitable if, contrary to Descartes, philosophy started from a
cogito that would posit itself absolutely independently of the Other.
For the Cartesian cogito is discovered, at the end of the Third
Meditation, to be supported on the certitude of the divine existence qua
infinite, by relation to which the finitude of the cogito, or the doubt, is
posited and conceivable. This finitude could not be determined without
recourse to the infinite, as is the case in the moderns, for whom :fini-
tude is, for example, determined on the basis of the mortality of the
subject. The Cartesian subject is given a point of view exterior to itself
from which it can apprehend itself. If, in a first movement, Descartes
takes a consciousness to be indubitable of itself by itself, in a second move-
ment-the reflection on reflection-he recognizes conditions for this
certitude. This certitude is due to the clarity and distinctness of the co-
gito, but certitude itself is sought because of the presence of infinity in
this finite thought, which without this presence would be ignorant of its
own finitude: ". . . manifeste intelligo plus realitatis esse in substantia
B. Ethics and the Face                         211
in/inita quam in /inita, ac proinde priorem quodammodo in me esse per-
ceptionem in/initi quam /initi, hoc est Dei quam mei ipsius. Qua enim
ratione intelligerem me dubitare me cupere, hoc est aliquid mihi deesse, et
me non esse omni no per/ectum si nu/la idea en tis per/ectionis in me esset,
ex cujus comparatione defectus meos cognoscerem?"3
Is the position of thought in the midst of the infinite that created it
and has given it the idea of infinity discovered by a reasoning or an
intuition that can posit only themes? The infinite can not be thema-
tized, and the distinction between reasoning and intuition does not apply
to the access to infinity. Is not the relation with infinity, in the twofold
structure of infinity present to the finite, but present outside of the finite,
foreign to theory? We have seen in it the ethical relation. If Husserl
sees in the cogito a subjectivity without any support outside of itself, this
cogito constitutes the idea of infinity itself and gives it to itself as an
object. The non-constitution of infinity in Descartes leaves a door open;
the reference of the finite cogito to the infinity of God does not consist in
a simple thematization of God. I of myself account for every object; I
contain them. The idea of infinity is not for me an object. The
ontological argument lies in the mutation of this "object" into being, into
independence with regard to me; God is the other. If to think consists
in referring to an object, we must suppose that the thought of infinity is
not a thought. What is it positively? Descartes does not raise the
question. It is in any case evident that the intuition of infinity retains a
rationalist meaning, and will not become any sort of invasion of God
across an inward emotion. becartes, better than an idealist or a realist,
discovers a relation with a total alterity irreducible to interiority, which
nevertheless does not do violence to interiority-a receptivity without
passivity, a relation between freedoms.
The last paragraph of the Third Meditation brings us to a relation
with infinity in thought which overflows thought and becomes a personal
relation. Contemplation turns into admiration, adoration, and joy. It

the infinite substance than in the finite substance, and my awareness of the
infinite must therefore be in some way prior to my awareness of the finite,
that is to say, my awareness of God must be prior to that of myself. For
how could I know that I doubt and desire, i.e., know that something is lack-
ing to me and that I am not wholly perfect, save by having in me the idea
of a being more perfect than myself, by comparison with which I may recog-
nize my deficiencies." Eng. trans. by Norman Kemp Smith, Descartes, Philo-
sophical Writings (New York, 1958), p. 205.]
212                         Totality and Infinity
is a question no longer of an "infinite object" still known and thema-
tized, but of a majesty: " . . . placet hie aliquamdiu in ipsius Dei
contemplatione immorari, eius attributa apud me expendere et immensi
huius luminis pulchritudinem quantum caligantis in genii mei acies f erre
poterit, intueri, admirari, adorare. Ut enim in hac so/a divinae majesta-
tis contemplatione sum man alterius vitae f elicitatem consistere fide credi-
mus, ita etiam jam ex eadem licet mu/to minus perfecta, maximum cujus
in hac vita capaces simus voluptatem percipi posse e);perimur . . ."•
To us this paragraph appears to be not a stylistic ornament or a
prudent hommage to religion, but the expression of this transformation
of the idea of infinity conveyed by knowledge into Majesty approached as
a face.


6. The Other and the Others
The presentation of the face, expression, does not disclose an inward
world previously closed, adding thus a new region to comprehend or to
take over.•• On the contrary, it calls to me above and beyond the given
that speech already puts in common among us. What one gives, what
one takes reduces itself to the phenomenon, discovered and open to the
grasp, carrying on an existence which is suspended in possession-
whereas the presentation of the face puts me into relation with being.
The existing of this being, irreducible to phenomenality understood as a
reality without reality, is effectuated in the non-postponable urgency
with which he requires a response. This response differs from the
"reaction" that the given gives rise to in that it cannot remain "between
us," as is the case with the steps I take with regard to a thing.
Everything that takes place here "between us" concerns everyone, the
face that looks at it places itself in the full light of the public order, even
if I draw back from it to seek with the interlocutor the complicity of a
private relation and a clandestinity.
• " ..• it seems to me right to linger for a while on the contemplation of
this all-perfect God, to ponder at leisure His marvelous attributes, to intuit,
to admire, to adore, the incomparable beauty of this inexhaustible light, so
far at least as the powers of my mind may permit, dazzled as they are by
what they are endeavoring to see. For just as by faith we believe that the
supreme felicity of the life to come consists in the contemplation of the Divine
majesty, so do we now experience that a similar meditation, though one so
much less perfect, can enable us to enjoy the highest contentment of which we
are capable in this present life." Ibid., p. 211.
•• "... a comprendre ou a prendre."
B. Ethics and the Face                         213
Language as the presence of the face does not invite complicity with
the preferred being, the self-sufficient "I-Thou" forgetful of the uni-
verse; in its frankness it refuses the clandestinity of love, where it loses
its frankness and meaning and turns into laughter or cooing. The third
party looks at me in the eyes of the Other-language is justice. It is not
that there first would be the face, and then the being it manifests or
expresses would concern himself with justice; the epiphany of the face
qua face opens humanity. The face in its nakedness as a face presents to
me the destitution of the poor one and the stranger; but this poverty and
exile which appeal to my powers, address me, do not deliver them-
selves over to these powers as givens, remain the expression of the face.
The poor one, the stranger, presents himself as an equal. His equality
within this essential poverty consists in referring to the third party, thus
present at the encounter, whom in the midst of his destitution the Other
already serves. He comes to join me. But he joins me to himself for ser-
vice; he commands me as a Master. This command can concern me only
inasmuch as I am master myself; consequently this command commands
me to command. The thou is posited in front of a we. To be we is
not to "jostle" one another or get together around a common task. The
presence of the face, the infinity of the other, is a destituteness, a presence
of the third party ( that is, of the whole of humanity which looks at us),
and a command that commands commanding. This is why the relation
with the Other, discourse, is not only the putting in question of my
freedom, the appeal coming from the other to call me to responsibility, is
not only the speech by which I divest myself of the possession that
encircles me by setting forth an objective and common world, but is also
sermon, exhortation, the prophetic word. By essence the prophetic word
responds to the epiphany of the face, doubles all discourse not as a
discourse about moral themes, but as an irreducible movement of a dis-
course which by essence is aroused by the epiphany of the face inasmuch
as it attests the presence of the third party, the whole of humanity, in the
eyes that look at me. Like a shunt every social relation leads back to the
presentation of the other to the same without the intermediary of any
image or sign, solely by the expression of the face. When taken to
be like a genus that unites like individuals the essence of society
is lost sight of. There does indeed exist a human race as a biological
genus, and the common function men may exercise in the world as a
totality permits the applying to them of a common concept. But the
human community instituted by language, where the interlocutors re-
214                        Totality and Infinity
main absolutely separated, does not constitute the unity of genus. It is
stated as a kinship of men. That all men are brothers is not explained by
their resemblance, nor by a common cause of which they would be the
effect, like medals which refer to the same die that struck them. Pater-
nity is not reducible to a causality in which individuals would mysteri-
ously participate, and which would determine, by no less mysterious an
effect, a phenomenon of solidarity.
It is my responsibility before a face looking at me as absolutely foreign
(and the epiphany of the face coincides with these two moments) that
constitutes the original fact of fraternity. Paternity is not a causality,
but the establishment of a unicity with which the unicity of the father
does and does not coincide.' The non-coincidence consists, concretely, in
my position as brother; it implies other unicities at my side. Thus my
unicity qua I contains both self-sufficiency of being and my partialness,
my position before the other as a face. In this welcoming of the face
( which is already my responsibility in his regard, and where accordingly
he approaches me from a dimension of height and dominates me),
equality is founded. Equality is produced where the other commands the
same and reveals himself to the same in responsibility; otherwise it is but
an abstract idea and a word. It cannot be detached from the welcoming
of the face, of which it is a moment.
The very status of the human implies fraternity and the idea of the
human race. Fraternity is radically opposed to the conception of a
humanity united by resemblance, a multiplicity of diverse families arisen
from the stones cast behind by Deucalion, and which, across the struggle
of egoisms, results in a human city. Human fraternity has then two
aspects: it involves individualities whose logical status is not reducible to
the status of ultimate differences in a genus, for their singularity consists
in each referring to itself. (An individual having a common genus with
another individual would not be removed enough from it.) On the
other hand, it involves the commonness of a father, as though the com-
monness of race would not bring together enough. Society must be a
fraternal community to be commensurate with the straightforwardness,
the primary proximity, in which the face presents itself to my wel-
come. Monotheism signifies this human kinship, this idea of a human
race that refers back to the approach of the Other in the face, m a
dimension of height, in responsibility for oneself and for the Other.

7. The Asymmetry of the Interpersonal
The presence of the face coming from beyond the world, but commit-
ting me to human fraternity, does not overwhelm me as a numinous
essence arousing fear and trembling. To be in relationship while absolv-
ing oneself from this relation is to speak. The Other does not only
appear in his face, as a phenomenon subject to the action and domination
of a freedom; infinitely distant from the very relation he enters, he pre-
sents himself there from the first as an absolute. The I disengages itself
from the relationship, but does so within relationship with a being
absolutely separated. The face with which the Other turns to me is not
reabsorbed in a representation of the face. To hear his destitution which
cries out for justice is not to represent an image to oneself, but is to posit
oneself as responsible, both as more and as less than the being that
presents itself in the face. Less, for the face summons me to my
obligations and judges me. The being that presents himself in the face
comes from a dimension of height, a dimension of transcendence whereby
he can present himself as a stranger without opposing me as obstacle or
enemy. More, for my position as I consists in being able to respond to
this essential destitution of the Other, finding resources for myself.
The Other who dominates me in his transcendence is thus the stranger,
the widow, and the orphan, to whom I am obligated.
These differences between the Other and me do not depend on differ-
ent "properties" that would be inherent in the "I," on the one hand, and,
on the other hand, in the Other, nor on different psychological disposi-
tions which their minds would take on from the encounter. They are
due to the I-Other conjuncture, to the inevitable orientation of being
"starting from oneself" toward "the Other." The priority of this
orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which cannot arise
without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work.
Being is not first, to afterwards, by breaking up, give place to a
diversity all of whose terms would maintain reciprocal relations among
themselves, exhibiting thus the totality from which they proceed, and in
which there would on occasion be produced a being existing for itself, an
I, facing another I (incidents that could be accounted for by an imper-
sonal discourse exterior to those incidents). Not even the language that
narrates it can depart from the orientation of the I to the Other.
Language does not take place in front of a correlation from which the I
would derive its identity and the Other his alterity. The separation
216                        Totality and Infinity
involved in language does not denote the presence of two beings in an
ethereal space where union simply echos separation. Separation is first
the fact of a being that lives somewhere, from something, that is, that en-
joys. The identity of the I comes to it from its egoism whose insular
sufficiency is accomplished by enjoyment, and to which the face teaches
the infinity from which this insular sufficiency is separated. This egoism
is indeed founded on the infinitude of the other, which can be accom-
plished only by being produced as the idea of Infinity in a separated being.
The other does indeed invoke this separated being, but this invocation is
not reducible to calling for a correlative. It leaves room for a process of
being that is deduced from itself, that is, remains separated and capable
of shutting itself up against the very appeal that has aroused it, but also
capable of welcoming this face of infinity with all the resources of its
egoism: economically. Speech is not instituted in a homogeneous or ab-
stract medium, but in a world where it is necessary to aid and to give. It
presupposes an I, an existence separated in its enjoyment, which does not
welcome empty-handed the face and its voice coming from another shore.
Multiplicity in being, which refuses totalization but takes form as frater-
nity and discourse, is situated in a "space" essentially asymmetrical.


8. Will and Reason
Discourse conditions thought, for the first intelligible is not a concept,
but an intelligence whose inviola,ble exteriority the face states in uttering
the "you shall not commit murder." The essence of discourse is ethical.
In stating this thesis, idealism is refused.
The idealist intelligible constitutes a system of coherent ideal relations
whose presentation before the subject is equivalent to the entry of the
subject into this order and its absorption into those ideal relations. The
subject has no resource in itself that does not dry up under the
intelligible sun. Its will is reason and its separation illusory (even
though the possibility of illusion attests the existence of an at least
subterranean subjective source which the intelligible cannot dry up).
Idealism completely carried out reduces all ethics to politics. The
Other and the I function as elements of an ideal calculus, receive from
this calculus their real being, and approach one another under the domin-
ion of ideal necessities which traverse them from all sides. They play the
role of moments in a system, and not that of origin. Political society
appears as a plurality that expresses the multiplicity of the articulations
B. Ethics and the Face                        217
of a system. In the kingdom of ends, where persons are indeed defined as
wills, but where the will is defined as what permits itself to be affected by
the universal-where the will wishes to be reason, be it practical reason
-multiplicity rests in fact only on the hope of happiness. The so-called
animal principle of happiness, ineluctable in the description of the will,
even taken as practical reason, maintains pluralism in the society of
minds.
In this world without multiplicity language loses all social significa-
tion; interlocutors renounce their unicity not in desiring one another
but in desiring the universal. Language would be equivalent to the
constitution of rational institutions in which an impersonal reason which
is already at work in the persons who speak and already sustains their
effective reality would become objective and effective: each being is
posited apart from all the others, but the will of each, or ipseity, from the
start consists in willing the universal or the rational, that is, in negating
its very particularity. In accomplishing its essence as discourse, in
becoming a discourse universally coherent, language would at the same
time realize the universal State, in which multiplicity is reabsorbed and
discourse comes to an end, for lack of interlocutors.
To distinguish formally will and understanding, will and reason,
nowise serves to maintain plurality in being or the unicity of the person if
one forthwith decides to consider only the will that adheres to clear ideas
or decides only through respect for the universal to be a good will.
If the will can aspire to reason in one way or another, it is reason, reason
seeking or forming itself; its true essence is revealed in Spinoza or in
Hegel. This identification of will and reason, which is the ultimate
intention of idealism, is opposed by the entire pathetic experience of
humanity, which the Hegelian or Spinozist idealism relegates to the
subjective or the imaginary. The interest of this opposition does not lie
in the very protestation of the individual who refuses the system and
reason, that is, in his arbitrariness, which the coherent discourse could
hence not silence by persuasion-but in the affirmation that makes this
opposition live. For the opposition does not consist in shutting one's eyes
to being and thus striking one's head madly against the wall so as to
surmount in oneself the consciousness of one's deficiencies of being, one's
destitution, and one's exile, and so as to transform a humiliation into
desperate pride. This opposition is inspired by the certainty of the sur-
plus which an existence separated from and thus desiring the full or
immutable being or being in act involves by relation to that being, that
218                         Totality and Infinity
is, the surplus that is produced by the society of infinity, an incessant
surplus that accomplishes the infinitude of infinity. The protestation
against the identification of the will with reason does not indulge in
arbitrariness, which, by its absurdity and immorality, would immediately
justify this identification. It proceeds from the certitude that the ideal of
a being accomplished from all eternity, thinking only itself, can not serve
as the ontological touchstone for a life, a becoming, capable of renewal, of
Desire, of society. Life is not comprehensible simply as a diminution, a
fall, or an embryo or virtuality of being. The individual and the per-
sonal count and act independently of the universal, which would mould
them. Moreover, the existence of the individual on the basis of the uni-
versal, or the fall from which it arises, remains unexplained. The indi-
'IJidual and the personal are necessary for Infinity to be able to be pro-
duced as infinite. 11 The impossibility of treating life in function of being
is manifested compellingly in Bergson, where duration no longer imitates,
in its fallenness, an immobile eternity, or in Heidegger, where possibility
no longer is referred to Ep-yov as a Mivaµts • Heidegger dissociates life
from the finality of potency tending toward act. That there could be a
more than being or an above being is expressed in the idea of creation
which, in God, exceeds a being eternally satisfied with itself. But this
notion of the being above being does not come from theology. If it has
played no role in the Western philosophy issued from Aristotle, the
Platonic idea of the Good ensures it the dignity of a philosophical
thought-and it therefore should not be traced back to any oriental
wisdom.
If the subjectivity were but a deficient mode of being, the distinguish-
ing between will and reason would indeed result in conceiving the will
as arbitrary, as a pure and simple negation of an embryonic or virtual
reason dormant in an I, and consequently as a negation of that I and a
violence in regard to oneself. If, on the contrary, the subjectivity is fixed
as a separated being in relation with an other absolutely other, the
Other, if the face brings the first signification, that is, the very upsurge of
the rational, then the will is distinguished fundamentally from the
intelligible, which it must not comprehend and into which it must not
disappear, for the intelligibility of this intelligible resides precisely in
ethical ~ehavior, that is, in the responsibility to which it invites the will.
The will is free to assume this responsibility in whatever sense it likes; it

11 See below, "The Truth of the Will," pp. 240   ff.
B. Ethics and the Face                         219
is not free to refuse this responsibility itself; it is not free to ignore the
meaningful world into which the face of the Other has introduced it. In
the welcoming of the face the will opens to reason. Language is not
limited to the maieutic awakening of thoughts common to beings. It
does not accelerate the inward maturation of a reason common to all; it
teaches and introduces the new into a thought. The introduction of the
new into a thought, the idea of infinity, is the very work of reason. The
absolutely new is the Other. The rational is not opposed to the experi-
enced; absolute experience, the experience of what is in no way a priori,
is reason itself. In discovering, as correlative of experience, the Other,
him who, being in himself essentially, can speak, and nowise sets himself
up as an object, the novelty contributed by experience is reconciled with
the ancient Socratic exigency of a mind nothing can force, an exigency
Leibniz again answers to in refusing the monads windows. The ethical
presence is both other and imposes itself without violence. As the
activity of reason commences with speech, the subject does not abdicate
his unicity, but confirms his separation. He does not enter into his own
discourse to disappear in it; it remains an apology. The passage to the
rational is not a dis-individuation precisely because it is language, that is,
a response to the being who in a face speaks to the subject and tolerates
only a personal response, that is, an ethical act.
## C. The Ethical Relation
## And Time


1. Subjectivity and Pluralism
Separation, effected in the concrete as habitation and economy, makes
possible the relation with the detached, absolute exteriority. This rela-
tion, metaphysics, is brought about primordially by the epiphany of the
Other in the face. Separation opens up between terms that are abso-
lute and yet in relation, that absolve themselves from the relation they
maintain, that do not abdicate in it in favor of a totality this relation
would sketch out. Thus the metaphysical relation realizes a multiple
existing [un exister multiple]-a pluralism. But this relation would not
realize pluralism if the formal structure of relationship exhausted the
essence of relationship. We must explicate the power that beings placed
in relation have of absolving themselves from the relation. This power
entails a different sense of absolution for each of the separated terms; the
Metaphysician is not absolute in the same sense as the Metaphysical.
The dimension of height from which the Metaphysical comes to the
Metaphysician indicates a sort of non-homogeneity of space, such that a
radical multiplicity, distinct from numerical multiplicity, can here be
produced. Numerical multiplicity remains defenseless against totaliza-
tion. For a multiplicity to be able to be produced in the order of being,
disclosure ( where being does not only manifest itself, but effectuates
itself, or exerts itself, or holds sway, or reigns) is not enough; it is not
enough that its production radiate in the cold splendor of truth. In this
splendor the diverse is united-under the panoramic look it calls for.
Contemplation is itself absorbed into this totality, and precisely in this
way founds that objective and eternal being or that "impassive nature re-
splendent in its eternal beauty" ( according to Pushkin's expression), in
which common sense recognizes the prototype of being, and which, for the
philosopher, confers its prestige on totality. The subjectivity of knowl-
220
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                        221
edge cannot break with this totality, which is reflected in the subject or
reflects the subject. The objective totality remains exclusionary of every
other, despite its being laid bare, that is, despite its apparition to an other.
Contemplation is to be defined, perhaps, as a process by which being is
revealed without ceasing to be one. The philosophy it commands is a
suppression of pluralism.
For a multiplicity to be maintained, there must be produced in it the
subjectivity that could not seek congruence with the being in which it is
produced. Being must hold sway as revealing itself, that is, in its very
being flowing toward an I that approaches it, but flowing toward it
infinitely without running dry, burning without being consumed. But
this approach can not be conceived as a cognition in which the knowing
subject is reflected and absorbed. That would be to forthwith destroy
this exteriority of being by a total reflection-which cognition aims at.
The impossibility of total reflection must not be posited negatively-as
the finitude of a knowing subject who, being mortal and already engaged
in the world, does not reach truth-but rather as the surplus of the social
relation, where the subjectivity remains in face of . . . , in the straight-
forwardness of this welcome, and is not measured by truth. The social
relation itself is not just another relation, one among so many others that
can be produced in being, but is its ultimate event. The very utterance
by which I state it and whose claim to truth, postulating a total
reflection, refutes the unsurpassable character of the face to face relation,
nonetheless confirms it by the very fact of stating this truth--of telling it
to the Other. Multiplicity therefore implies an objectivity posited in the
impossibility of total reflection, in the impossibility of con joining the I
and the non-I in a whole. This impossibility is not negative-which
would be to still posit it by reference to the idea of truth contemplated.
It results from the surplus of the epiphany of the other, who dominates
me from his height.
This foundation of pluralism does not congeal in isolation the terms
that constitute the plurality. While maintaining them against the total-
ity that would absorb them, it leaves them in commerce or in war. At
no moment are they posited as causes of themselves-which would be to
remove from them all receptivity and all activity, shut them up each in
its own interiority, and isolate them like the Epicurean gods living in the
interstices of being, or like the gods immobilized in the between-time1 of

art, left for all eternity on the edge of the interval, at the threshold of a
future that is never produced, statues looking at one another with empty
eyes, idols which, contrary to Gyges, are exposed and do not see. Our
analyses of separation have opened another perspective. The primordial
form of this multiplicity is not, however, produced as war, nor as
commerce. War and commerce presupose the face and the transcendence
of the being appearing in the face. War can not be derived from the
empirical fact of the multiplicity of beings that limit one another, under
the pretext that where the presence of the one inevitably limits the other,
violence is identical with this limitation. Limitation is not of itself
violence. Limitation is conceivable only within a totality where the
parts mutually define one another. Definition, far from doing violence
to the identity of the terms united into a totality, ensures this identity.
The limit separates and unites in a whole. The reality fragmented into
concepts that mutually limit one another forms a totality by virtue of
that very fragmentation. As a play of antagonistic forces the world
forms a whole, and is deducible or should be deducible, in a completed
scientific thought, from one unique formula. What one is tempted to
call antagonism of forces or of concepts presupposes a subjective perspec-
tive, and a pluralism of wills. The point at which this perspective
converges does not form a part of the totality. Violence in nature thus
refers to an existence precisely not limited by an other, an existence that
maintains itself outside of the totality. But the exclusion of violence by
beings susceptible of being integrated into a totality is not equivalent to
peace. Totality absorbs the multiplicity of beings, which peace implies.
Only beings capable of war can rise to peace. War like peace presup-
poses beings structured otherwise than as parts of a totality.
War therefore is to be distinguished from the logical opposition of the
one and the other by which both are defined within a totality open to a
panoramic view, to which they would owe their very opposition. In war
beings refuse to belong to a totality, refuse community, refuse law; no
frontier stops one being by another, nor defines them. They affirm
thPmselves as transcending the totality, each identifying itself not by its
place in the whole, but by its self.
War presupposes the transcendence of the antagonist; it is waged
against man. It is surrounded with honors and pays the last honors; it
aims at a presence that comes always from elsewhere, a being that
appears in a face. It is neither the hunt nor struggle with an ele-
ment. The possibility, retained by the adversary, of thwarting the
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                    223
best laid calculations expresses the separation, the breach of totality,
across which the adversaries approach one another. The warrier runs a
risk; no logistics guarantees victory. The calculations that make possible
the determination of the outcome of a play of forces within a totality do
not decide war. It lies at the limit of a supreme confidence in oneself
and a supreme risk. It is a relation between beings exterior to totality,
which hence are not in touch with one another.
But would the violence that is impossible among beings ready to
constitute a totality-that is, to reconstitute it-then be possible among
separated beings? How could separated beings maintain any relation,
even violence? It is that the refusal of totality in war does not refuse
relationship--since in war the adversaries seek out one another.
Relationship between separated being would indeed be absurd were
the terms posited as substances, each causa sui, since, as pure activities,
capable of receiving no action, the terms could undergo no violence. But
the relation of violence does not remain at the level of the wholly formal
conjuncture of relationship. It implies a specific structure of the terms
in relation. Violence bears upon only a being both graspable and
escaping every hold. Without this living contradiction in the being that
undergoes violence the deployment of violent force would reduce itself to
a labor.
Thus for relationship between separated beings to be possible, the
multiple terms would have to be partially independent and partially in
relation. The notion of finite freedom then imposes itself to reRection.
But how is such a notion to be formed? To say that a being is partially
free immediately raises the problem of the relation existing in it be-
tween the free part, causa sui, and the non-free part. To say that the
free part is impeded in the non-free part would bring us back indefinitely
to the same difficulty: how can the free part, causa sui, undergo any-
thing whatever from the non-free part? The finitude of freedom must
therefore not signify some limit within the substance of the free being,
divided into one part endowed with a causality of its own and one part
subject to exterior causes. The notion of independence must be grasped
elsewhere than in causality. Independence would not be equivalent
to the idea of causa sui, which, moreover, is belied by birth, non-chosen
and impossible to choose ( the great drama of contemporary thought),
which situates the will in an anarchic world, that is, a world without
origin.
Thus freedom, an abstraction that reveals itself to be self-contradic-
224                          Totality and Infinity
tory when one supposes it to have a limitation, can not describe beings in
the relation that does not constitute totality, beings in war.
A being independent of and yet at the same time exposed to the other is
a temporal being: to the inevitable violence of death it opposes its time,
which is postponement itself. It is not finite freedom that makes the
notion of time intelligible; it is time that gives a meaning to the notion of
finite freedom. Time is precisely the fact that the whole existence of the
mortal being-exposed to violence--is not being for death, but the "not
yet" which is a way of being against death, a retreat before death in the
very midst of its inexorable approach. In war death is brought to what
is moving back, to what for the moment exists completely. Thus in war
the reality of the time that separates a being from its death, the reality
of a being taking up a position with regard to death, that is, the reality of
a conscious being and its interiority, is recognized. As causa sui or
freedom beings would be immortal, and could not, in a kind of dumb
and absurd hatred,* grapple on to one another. Were beings only given
over to violence, only mortal, they would be dead in a world where
nothing opposes anything, a world whose time would break up into
eternity. The notion of a mortal but temporal being, apprehended in the
will (a notion we shall develop) differs fundamentally from every
causality leading to the idea of the causa sui. Such a being is ex-
posed, but also opposed to violence. Violence does not befall it as
an accident that befalls a sovereign freedom. The hold that violence
has over this being-the mortality of this being-is the primordial fact.
Freedom itself is but its adjournment by time. What is at issue is not
finite freedom in which a singular compound of activity and passivity
would be produced, but rather a freedom originally null, offered in death
to the other, but in which time arises as a detente: the free will is neces-
sity relaxed and postponed rather than finite freedom. It is detente or
distension-postponement by virtue of which nothing is definitive yet,
nothing consummated, skill which finds for itself a dimension of retreat
there where the inexorable is imminent.
The contact of the soul with the body it has at its disposal is inverted
into the non-contact of a blow struck in the void. The adversary's skill,
which cannot be summed up in forces, has to be taken into account-but
how take it into account? My skill postpones the inevitable. To
hit, the blow must be struck there where the adversary has absented
himself; to be parried, I have to pull back from the point at which he
• " .. , haine sourde et absurde . . ."
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                    225
touches me. Ruse and ambush-Ulysses' craft--constitute the es-
sence of war. This skill is inscribed in the very existence of the body;
it is suppleness-a simultaneity of absence and presence. Corporeity is
the mode of existence of a being whose presence is postponed at the very
moment of his presence. Such a distension in the tension of the instant
can only come from an infinite dimension which separates me from the
other, both present and still to come, a dimension opened by the face of
the Other. War can be produced only when a being postponing its death
is exposed to violence. It can be produced only where discourse was
possible: discourse subtends war itself. Moreover violence does not aim
simply at disposing of the other as one disposes of a thing, but, already at
the limit of murder, it proceeds from unlimited negation. It can aim at
only a presence itself infinite despite its insertion in the field of my
powers. Violence can aim only at a face.
It is therefore not freedom that accounts for the transcendence of the
Other, but the transcendence of the Other that accounts for freedom-a
transcendence of the Other with regard to me which, being infinite, does
not have the same signification as my transcendence with regard to him.
The risk that war involves measures the distance that separates bodies
within their hand-to-hand struggle. The Other, in the hands of forces
that break him, exposed to powers, remains unforeseeable, that is, tran-
scendent. This transcendence is not to be described negatively, but is
manifested positively in the moral resistance of the face to the violence of
murder. The force of the Other is already and henceforth moral.
Freedom, be it that of war, can be manifested only outside totality, but
this "outside totality" opens with the transcendence of the face. To
think of freedom as within totality is to reduce freedom to the status of
an indetermination in being, and forthwith to integrate it into a totality
by closing the totality over the "holes" of indetermination-and seeking
with psychology the laws of a free being!
But the relation that subtends war, an asymmetrical relation with the
other who, as infinity, opens time, transcends and dominates the subjec-
tivity ( the I not being transcendent with regard to the other in the same
sense that the other is transcendent with regard to me), can take on the
aspect of a symmetrical relation. The face, whose ethical epiphany
consists in soliciting a response ( which the violence of war and its
murderous negation alone can seek to reduce to silence), is not satisfied
with a "good intention" and a benevolence wholly Platonic. The "good
intention" and the "benevolence wholly Platonic" are only the residue of
226                        Totality and Infinity
an attitude assumed where one en joys things, where one can divest one-
self of them and offer them. Henceforth the independence of the I
and its position before the absolutely other can figure in a history and
a politics. Separation is embedded in an order in which the asymme-
try of the interpersonal relation is effaced, where I and the other become
interchangeable in commerce, and where the particular man, an individu-
ation of the genus man, appearing in history, is substituted for the I and
for the other.
Separation is not effaced in this ambiguity. We must now show in
what concrete form the freedom of separation is lost, and in what sense it
is maintained even in its very loss, and can resurrect.


2. Commerce, the Historical Relation, and the Face
The will at work ensures the separated being's being at home with
itself. But in its work, which has a signification but remains mute, the
will remains unexpressed. Labor, in which it is exerted, is visibly
inserted in the things, but the will forthwith absents itself from them,
since works take on the anonymity of merchandise, an anonymity into
which, as a wage-earner, the worker himself may disappear.
The separated being can, to be sure, shut itself up in its interiority.
Things can not counter it absolutely, and Epicurean wisdom lives from
this truth. But the will, whereby a being wields itself by somehow
holding in its own hands all the strings that operate its being, is by its
work exposed to the Other. Its exertion is seen as a thing, if only by
virtue of the insertion of its body in the world of things. Corporeity
thus describes the ontological regime of a primary self-alienation, con-
temporaneous with the very event by which the self ensures, against the
unknown factor of the elements, its own independence, that is, its
self-possession or its security. The will equivalent to atheism-which
refuses the Other as an influence being exerted on an I or holding it in its
invisible meshes, which refuses the Other as a God inhabiting the I-the
will which tears itself from this possession, from this enthusiasm, as the
very power of rupture, delivers itself over to the Other in its work,
the very work which permits it to ensure its interiority. Interiority thus
does not exhaust the existence of the separated being.
The idea of fatum accounted for the reversal every heroism in a role
suffers. The hero finds himself playing a role in a drama exceeding his
heroic intentions, which, by their very opposition to that drama, hasten
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                    227
the accomplishment of designs foreign to them. The absurdity of the
fa tum foils the sovereign will. In fact inscription in a foreign will is
produced through the mediation of the work, which separates itself from
its author, his intentions, and his possession, and which another will lays
hold of. The labor which brings being into our possession ipso facto
relinquishes it, is in the very sovereignty of its powers unceremoniously
delivered over to the Other.
Every will separates itself from its work. The movement proper to
action consists in issuing in the unknown-in not being able to measure
all its consequences. The unknown does not result from a factual
ignorance; the unknown upon which action issues resists all knowledge,
does not stand out in the light, since it represents the meaning the work
receives from the other. The other can dispossess me of my work, take it
or buy it, and thus direct my very becavior; I am exposed to instiga-
tion. The work is destined to this alien Sinngehung from the moment of
its origin in me. It is to be emphasized that this destination of the work
to a history that I cannot foresee-for I cannot see it-is inscribed in the
very essence of my power, and does not result from the contingent
presence of other persons alongside of me.
Power is not entirely one with its own impetus, does not accompany
its work up to the end. A separation opens between the producer
and the product. At a given moment the producer no longer follows
up, remains behind. His transcendence stops mid-way. In contrast
with the transcendence of expression, in which the being that expresses
himself personally attends the work of expression, production attests
the author of the work in his absence, as a plastic form. This inex-
pressive character of the product is reflected positively in its market
value, in its suitability for others, in its capability to assume the meaning
others will give it, to enter into an entirely different context from that
which engendered it. The work uoes not defend itself against the
Other's Sinngehung, and exposes the will that produced it to contestation
and unrecognition; it lends itself to the designs of a foreign will and
allows itself to be appropriated. The willing of the living will postpones
this subjection, and accordingly wills against the Other and his threat.
But this way a will plays in history a role it has not willed marks the
limits of interiority: the will finds itself caught up in events that will
appear only to the historian. Historical events link up in works. Wills
without works will constitute no history; there is no purely interior
history. History, in which the interiority of each will manifests itself
228                       Totality and Infinity
only in plastic form-in the muteness of products-is an economic his-
tory. In history the will is congealed into a personage interpreted on the
basis of his work, in which the essential of the will productive of things,
dependent on things, but struggling against this dependence which deliv-
ers it to the Other, is obscured. As long as the will, in a being who
speaks, takes up again and defends his work against a foreign will,
history lacks the distance it lives from. Its reign commences in the
world of realities-results, the world of "complete works," the heritage of
dead wills.
The whole being of willing is hence not enacted within oneself. The
capacity of the independent I does not contain its own being; willing
escapes willing. The work is always in a certain sense an abortive
action. I am not entirely what I want to do. Thus there lies open an
unlimited field of investigation for psychoanalysis or sociology, which
apprehend the will on the basis of its apparition in the work, in its
behavior, or in its products.
The order hostile to the will dispossessed of its work, from which the
willing is thus turned, depends on foreign wills. The work has a
meaning for other wills; it can serve another and eventually turn against
its author. The "misconstruction" acquired by the result of the will that
has withdrawn from its work is due to the will that has survived.
The absurd has a meaning for someone. Fate does not precede history;
it follows it. Fate is the history of the historiographers, accounts of the
survivors, who interpret, that is, utilize the works of the dead. The his-
torical distance which makes this historiography, this violence, this
subjection possible is proportionate to the time necessary for the will to
lose its work completely. Historiography recounts the way the survivors
appropriate the works of dead wills to themselves; it rests on the
usurpation carried out by the conquerors, that is, by the survivors; it
recounts enslavement, forgetting the life that struggles against slavery.
The fact that the will escapes itself, that the will does not contain
itself, amounts to the possibility the others have of laying hold of the
work, alienating, acquiring, buying, stealing it. The will itself
thus takes on a meaning for the other, as though it were a thing. In the
historical relation one will, to be sure, does not approach another as a
thing. This relation does not resemble that which characterizes labor:
in commerce and war the relation with the work remains a relation with
the worker. But across the gold that buys him or the steel that kills him
the Other is not approached face to face ; even though they traverse the
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                       229
interval of a transcendence commerce aims at the anonymous market,
war is waged against a mass. Material things, bread and wine,
clothing and the home, like the blade of steel, have a hold on the "for
itself" of the will. The part of eternal truth that materialism involves
lies in the fact that the human will can be laid hold of in its works. The
point of the sword, a physical reality, can exclude a meaningful activity,
a subject, a "for itself," from the world. This great banality is none-
theless most astonishing: the for itself of the will, unshakeable in its
happiness, is exposed to violence; spontaneity undergoes, turns into
its contrary. The steel touches not an inert being, the gold attracts
not a thing but a will which qua will, qua "for itself," should have been
immune from every attack. Violence recognizes, but bends the
will. Threat and seduction act by slipping into the interstice that
separates the work from the will. Violence is corruption-seduction and
threat, where the will is betrayed. This status of the will is the body.
The body exceeds the categories of a thing, but does not coincide with
the role of "lived body" ["corps propre"] which I dispose of in my
voluntary action and by which I can. The ambiguity of corporeal
resistance which turns into a means and from means turns into a
resistance does not account for its ontological hybris. The body in its
very activity, in its for itself, inverts into a thing to be treated as a thing.
This is what we express concretely in saying that it abides between health
and sickness. Through it one not only fails to recognize, one can
mistreat the "for itself" of the person; one does not only offend him, one
coerces him. "I am anything you like," says Sganarelle, under the blows.
One does not adopt successively and independently the biological point
of view on it and the "point of view" which from the interior maintains
it as a lived body; the originality of the body consists of the coinciding of
two points of view. This is the paradox and the essence of time itself
proceeding unto death, where the will is affected as a thing by the things
-by the point of steel or by the chemistry of the tissues ( due to a
murderer or to the impotency of the doctors)-but gives itself a reprieve
and postpones the contact by the against-death of postponement. The
will essentially violable harbors treason in its own essence. It is not only
offendable in its dignity-which would confirm its inviolable character
-but is· susceptible of being coerced and enslaved as a will, becoming
a servile soul. Gold and threats force it not only to sell its products but
to sell itself. Or again, the human will is not heroic.
The corporeity of the will must be understood on the basis of this
230                        Totality and Infinity
ambiguity of voluntary power, exposing itself to the others in its centripe-
tal movement of egoism. The body is its ontological regime, and not an
object. The body, where expression can dawn forth and where the ego-
ism of the will becomes discourse and primal opposition, at the same
time conveys the entry of the I into the calculations of the Other.
An interaction of wills or a history then becomes possible--an interaction
of wills each defined as causa sui, since action upon a pure activity
would presuppose a passivity in that activity. The ambiguity of the
ontological regime of the body is founded in mortality, which we shall
treat of below.
But is not total independence of the will realized in courage?
Courage, the power to face death, at first sight does seem to carry out the
total independence of the will; he who has accepted his death remains
exposed to the violence of the assassin, but does he not refuse his consent
to a foreign will to the end? -Unless the Other wills that very death.
Then, while refusing consent, the will gives satisfaction to the foreign
will in spite of itself, by the result of its behavior, precisely by its work.
In the extreme situation of the struggle unto death the refusal to acquiese
to a foreign will can revert into satisfaction given to this hostile will.
The acceptance of death therefore does not enable me to resist with
certainty the murderous will of the Other. Absolute dissention with a
foreign will does not preclude the carrying out of his designs. Refusing
to serve another by one's life does not preclude serving him by one's
death. The being that wills does not exhaust the destiny of his existence
in his will. This destiny does not necessarily imply a tragedy, for
resolute opposition to the foreign will is, perhaps, madness, since one can
speak to the Other and desire him.
The Other's designs do not present themselves to me as do the laws of
things. His schemes show themselves to be inconvertible into data of a
problem, which the will might calculate. The will that refuses the for-
eign will is obliged to recognize this foreign will as absolutely exterior,
as untranslatable into thoughts that would be immanent in itself. What-
ever be the extension of my thoughts, limited by nothing, the Other can-
not be contained by me: he is unthinkable--he is infinite and recognized
as such. This recognition is not produced again as a thought, but is
produced as morality. The total refusal of the other, the will preferring
death to servitude, annihilating its own existence in order to cut short
every relation with the exterior, cannot prevent this work, which does not
express him, from which he absents himself ( for it is not a word), from
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                     231
being entered in this alien reckoning, which it defies, but recognizes
precisely in its supreme courage. By its work the sovereign and self-
enclosed will confirms the foreign will it means to ignore, and finds it-
self "made game of" by the Other. Thus a plane is manifested in which
the will, though it have broken with participation, finds itself inscribed,
and in which, in spite of itself, impersonally, even its supreme initiative,
the breaking with being, is transcribed. In its effort to escape the Other
in dying, it recognizes the other. The suicide to which it resolves itself
in order to escape servitude is inseparable from the pain of "losing,"
whereas this death should have shown the absurdity of every game. Mac-
beth wishes for the destruction of the world in his defeat and his death
("and wish th'estate o'th'world were now undone")---or more pro-
foundly still, he wishes that the nothingness of death be a void as total
as that which would have reigned had the world never been created.
And yet in its separation from the work and in the possible betrayal
that threatens it in the course of its very exercise, the will becomes aware
of this betrayal and thereby keeps itself at a distance from it. Thus,
faithful to itself, it remains in a certain sense inviolable, escapes its own
history, and renews itself. There is no inward history. The inward-
ness of the will posits itself subject to a jurisdiction which scrutinizes its
intentions, before which the meaning of its being coincides totally with
its inward will. The volitions of the will do not weigh on it, and from
the jurisdiction to which it opens comes pardon, the power to efface, to
absolve, to undo history. The '!ill thus moves between its betrayal and
its fidelity which, simultaneous, describe the very originality of its power.
But the fidelity does not forget the betrayal-and the religious will
remains a relation with the Other. Fidelity is won by repentance and
prayer (a privileged word in which the will seeks its fidelity to itself);
and the pardon which ensures it this fidelity comes to it from the outside.
Hence the rights of the inward will, its certitude of being a misunder-
stood will, still reveal a relation with exteriority. The will awaits its
investiture and pardon. It awaits them from an exterior will, but one
from which it would experience no longer shock but judgment, an
exteriority withdrawn from the antagonism of wills, withdrawn from
history. This possibility of justification and pardon, as religious con-
sciousness in which interiority tends to coincide with being, opens before
the Other, to whom I can speak. I speak a word that, in the measure
that it welcomes the Other as Other, offers or sacrifices to him a product
of labor, and consequently does not play above economy. Thus we see
232                        Totality and Infinity
expression, the other extremity of the voluntary power that is separated
from its work and betrayed by it, nonetheless referring to the inexpres-
sive work by which the will, free with regard to history, partakes of
history.
The will, in which the identity of the same holds sway in its fidelity to
itself and in its betrayal, does not result from the empirical accident that
would have placed a being in the midst of a multiplicity of beings which
contest its identity. The will contains this duality of betrayal and
fidelity in its mortality, which is produced or holds sway in its corporeity.
A being in which multiplicity does not designate the simple divisibility of
a whole into parts nor the simple unity of number of the gods living each
for itself in the interstices between beings requires mortality and cor-
poreity. For otherwise either the imperialist will would reconstitute a
whole, or, as a physical body, neither mortal nor immortal, it would form
a simple block. The postponement of death in a mortal will-time-is
the mode of existence and reality of a separated being that has entered
into relation with the Other. This space of time has to be taken as the
point of departure. In it is enacted a meaningful life which one must
not measure against an ideal of eternity, taking its duration and its
interests to be absurd or illusory.


3. The Will and Death
Death is interpreted in the whole philosophical and religious tradition
either as a passage to nothingn~ss or as a passage to another existence,
continuing in a new setting. It is thought within the alternative of
being and nothingness, which is accredited by the death of our relatives,
who do indeed cease to exist in the empirical world, which, for this
world, means disappearance or departure. More profoundly and as it
were a priori we approach death as nothingness in the passion for
murder. The spontaneous intentionality of this passion aims at annihila-
tion. Cain, when he slew Abel, should have possessed this knowledge of
death. The identifying of death with nothingness befits the death of the
other in murder. But at the same time this nothingness presents itself
there as a sort of impossibility. For the Other cannot present himself as
Other outside of my conscience, and his face expresses my moral
impossibility of annihilating. This interdiction is to be sure not
equivalent to pure and simple impossibility, and even presupposes the
possibility which precisely it forbids-but in fact the interdiction already
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                     233
dwells in this very possibility rather than presupposing it; it is not added
to it after the event, but looks at me from the very depths of the eyes I
want to extinguish, looks at me as the eye that in the tomb shall look
at Cain. The movement of annihilation in murder is therefore a purely
relative annihilation, a passage to the limit of a negation attempted
within the world. In fact it leads us toward an order of which we can
say nothing, not even being, antithesis of the impossible nothingness.
One might wonder that we contest here the truth of the thought that
situates death either in nothingness or in being, as though the alternative
of being and nothingness were not ultimate. Shall we deny that tertium
non datur'f
And yet my relation with my own death places me before a category
that does not enter into either term of this alternative. The sense of
my death is contained in the refusal of this ultimate alternative.
My death is not deduced from the death of the others by analogy;
it is inscribed in the fear I can have for my being. The "knowledge"
of the threatening precedes every experience reasoned in terms of
the death of the Other; in naturalist language this is termed an
instinctive knowledge of death. It is not the knowledge of death that
defines menace; it is in the imminence of death, in its irreducible oncom-
ing movement, that menace originally consists, that the "knowledge of
death" is (if one may put it so) uttered and articulated. Fear measures
this movement. The imminence of the menace does not come from a
precise point of the future. Ultima latet. The unforeseeable character
of the ultimate instant is not due to an empirical ignorance, to the limited
horizon of our understanding, which a greater understanding would
have been able to overcome. The unforeseeable character of death is due
to the fact that it does not lie within any horizon. It is not open to
grasp. It takes me without leaving me the chance I have in a struggle,
for in reciprocal struggle I grasp what takes hold of me. In death I
am exposed to absolute violence, to murder in the night. But in fact
already in struggle I contend with the invisible. Struggle must not be
confounded with the collision of two forces whose issue one can foresee
and calculate. Struggle is already, or again, war, where between the
forces that confront one another gapes open the interval of transcendence
across which death comes and strikes without being received. The Other,
inseparable from the very event of transcendence, is situated in the region
from which death, possibly murder, comes. The unwonted hour of its
coming approaches as the hour of fate fixed by someone. Hostile and
234                        Totality and Infinity
malevolant powers, more wily, more clever than I, absolutely other and
only thereby hostile, retain its secret. Death, in its absurdity, maintains
an interpersonal order, in which it tends to take on a signification-as in
the primitive mentality where, according to Levy-Bruh!, it is never nat-
ural, but requires a magical explanation. The things that bring death to
me, being graspable and subject to labor, obstacles rather than menaces,
refer to a malevolence, are the residue of a bad will which surprises and
stalks. Death threatens me from beyond. This unknown that frightens,
the silence of the infinite spaces that terrify, comes from the other, and
this alterity, precisely as absolute, strikes me in an evil design or in a
judgment of justice. The solitude of death does not make the Other
vanish, but remains in a consciousness of hostility, and consequently still
renders possible an appeal to the Other, to his friendship and his medica-
tion. The doctor is an a priori principle of human mortality. Death
approaches in the fear of someone, and hopes in someone. "The Eternal
brings death and brings life." A social conjuncture is maintained in this
menace. It does not sink into the anxiety that would transform it into a
"nihilation of nothingness." In the being for death of fear I am not
faced with nothingness, but faced with what is against me, as though
murder, rather than being one of the occasions of dying, were inseparable
from the essence of death, as though the approach of death remained one
of the modalities of the relation with the Other. The violence of death
threatens as a tyranny, as though proceeding from a foreign will. The
order of necessity that is carried out in death is not like an implacable
law of determinism governing a totality, but is rather like the alienation
of my will by the Other. It is, of course, not a question of inserting
death into a primitive ( or developed) religious system that would ex-
plain it; but it is a question of showing, behind the threat it brings
against the will, its reference to an interpersonal order whose significa-
tion it does not annihilate.
One does not know when death will come. What will come? With
what does death threaten me? With nothingness or with recommence-
ment? I do not know. In this impossibility of knowing the after my
death resides the essence of the last moment. I can absolutely not
apprehend the moment of death; it is "out of reach," as Montaigne
would say. Ultima latet-contrary to all the instants of my life, which
are spread out between my birth and my death, and which can be recalled
or anticipated. My death comes from an instant upon which I can in no
way exercise my power. I do not run up against an obstacle which at
least I touch in that collision, which, in surmounting or in enduring it, I
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                     235
integrate into my life, suspending its alterity. Death is a menace that
approaches me as a mystery; its secrecy determines it-it approaches
without being able to be assumed, such that the time that separates me
from my death dwindles and dwindles without end, involves a sort of
last interval which my consciousness cannot traverse, and where a leap
will somehow be produced from death to me. The last part of the route
will he crossed without me; the time of death flows upstream; the I in its
projection toward the future is overturned by a movement of imminence,
pure menace, which comes to me from an absolute alterity. Thus in a
tale by Edgar Allen Poe, as the walls that imprison the narrator close in
inexorably, he looks upon death with a look which as a look has always
an expanse before it, but perceives also the uninterrupted approach of an
instant infinitely future for the I who awaits it-ultima latet-which, in
a countercurrent movement, will efface this infinitesimal-but untrav-
ersable-distance. This interference of movements across the distance
that separates me from the last moment distinguishes the temporal
interval from spatial distance.
But imminence is at the same time menace and postponement. It
pushes on, and it leaves time. To he temporal is both to be for death and
to still have time, to be against death. In the way the menace affects me
in imminence resides my being implicated by the menace, and the essence
of fear. It is a relation with an instant whose exceptional character is
due not to the fact that it is at the threshold of nothingness or of a
rebirth, but to the fact that, in life, it is the impossibility of every
possibility, the stroke of a total passivity alongside of which the passivity
of the sensibility, which moves into activity, is but a distant imitation.
Thus the fear for my being which is my relation with death is not the
fear of nothingness, but the fear of violence-and thus it extends into
fear of the Other, of the absolutely unforeseeable.
It is in mortality that the interaction of the psychic and the physical
appears in it:5 primordial form. The interaction of the physical and the
psychic, when approached from the psychic, posited as for itself or as
causa sui, and from the physical, posited as unfolding in function of
the "other," gives rise to a problem due to the abstraction to which
the terms in relation are reduced. Mortality is the concrete and primary
phenomenon. It forbids the positing of a for itself that would not be
already delivered over to the Other and consequently be a thing. The
for itself, essentially mortal, does not only represent things to itself, but
is subject to them.
But if the will is mortal and susceptible to violence from a blade of
236                        Totality and Infinity
steel, from the chemistry of poison, from hunger and thirst, if it is a body
maintaining itself between health and sickness, this is not only because
it would be surrounded by nothingness. This nothingness is an in-
terval beyond which lurks a hostile will. I am a passivity threatened
not only by nothingness in my being, but by a will in my will. In my
action, in the for itself of my will, I am exposed to a foreign will. This
is why death cannot drain all meaning from life. I am exposed not
merely because of a Pascalian diversion, or a fall into the anonymity of
everyday life in the Heideggerian sense of the term. The enemy or the
God over whom I can have no power• and who does not form a part of
my world remains yet in relation with me and permits me to will, but
with a will that is not egoist, a will that flows into the essence of desire
whose center of gravitation does not coincide with the I of need, the de-
sire that is for the Other. Murder, at the origin of death, reveals a
cruel world, but one to the scale of human relations. The will, already
betrayal and alienation of itself but postponing this betrayal, on the way
to death but a death ever future, exposed to death but not immediately,
has time to be for the Other, and thus to recover meaning despite death.
This existence for the Other, this Desire of the other, this goodness
liberated from the egoist gravitation, nonetheless retains a personal
character. The being thus defined has its time at its disposal precisely
because it postpones violence, that is, because a meaningful order subsists
beyond death, and thus all the possibilities of discourse are not reduced
to desperate blows of a head struck against the wall. The Desire into
which the threatened will dissolves no longer defends the powers of a
will, but, as the goodness whose meaning death cannot efface, has its cen-
ter outside of itself. We shall have to show this in the course of bring-
ing to light the other chance that the will seizes upon in the time left it
by its being against death: the founding of institutions in which the will
ensures a meaningful, but impersonal world beyond death.


4. Time and the Will: Patience
In affirming that the human will is not heroic we have not declared for
human cowardice, but have indicated the precarity of courage, always on
the verge of its own failure by reason of the essential mortality of the

• "Je ne peux pouvoir"-the power meant here is that primordial ability of
the "I can" that holds away in the "I know."-Trans.
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                      237
will, which in its exercise betrays itself. But in this very failing we have
caught sight of the marvel of time, as futurition and postponement of this
expiration. The will combines a contradiction: an immunity from every
exterior attack to the point of positing itself as uncreated and immortal,
endowed with a force above every quantifiable force ( nothing less is
attested by the self-consciousness in which the inviolable being takes
refuge: "Not for eternity will I waver")-and the permanent fallibility
of this inviolable sovereignty, to the point that voluntary being lends
itself to techniques of seduction, propaganda, and torture. The will can
succumb to tyrannical pressure and corruption, as though only the
quantity of energy it puts forth to resist or the quantity of energy exerted
upon it distinguished cowardice from courage. When the will triumphs
over its passions, it manifests itself not only as the strongest passion, but
as above all passion, determining itself by itself, inviolable. But when it
has succumbed, it reveals itself to be exposed to influences, to be a force
of nature, absolutely tractable, resolving itself purely and simply into its
components. In its self-consciousness it is violated. Its "freedom of
thought" is extinguished: the pressure of forces initially adverse ends up
appearing as a penchant. In a sort of inversion it loses even the
consciousness of the bent of its penchants. The will remains on this
moving limit between inviolability and degeneration.
This inversion is more radical than sin, for it threatens the will in its
very structure as a will, in its dignity as origin and identity. But at the
same time this inversion is infinitely less radical, for it only threatens, is
indefinitely postponed, is consciousness. Consciousness is resistance to
violence, because it leaves the time necessary to forestall it. Human
freedom resides in the future, always still minimally future, of its non-
freedom, in consciousness-the prevision of the violence imminent in the
time that still remains. To be conscious is to have time--not to overflow
the present by anticipating and hastening the future, but to have a
distance with regard to the present: to relate oneself to being as to a being
to come, to maintain a distance with regard to being even while already
coming under its grip. To be free is to have time to forestall one's own
abdication under the threat of violence.
By virtue of time, the being defined, that is, self-identical, by reason
of its place within the whole, the natural being ( for birth describes
precisely the entry into the whole that preexists and outlives), has not yet
reached its term, remains at a distance from itself, is still preparatory, in
the vestibule of being, still this side of the fatality of the non-chosen birth,
238                         Totality and Infinity
not yet accomplished. The being defined by its birth can thus take
up a position with regard to its nature; it disposes of a background
and, in this sense, is not completely born, remains anterior to its defini-
tion or its nature. One instant does not link up with another to form a
present. The identity of the present splits up into an inexhausible
multiplicity of possibles that sus?end the instant. And this gives mean-
ing to initiative, which nothing definitive paralyses, and to consolation-
for how could one sole tear, though it be effaced, be forgotten, how could
reparation have the least value, if it did not correct the instant itself, if it
did not let it escape in its being, if the pain that glints in the tear did not
exist "pending," if it did not exist with a still provisional being, if the
present were consummated?
The privileged situation where the ever future evil becomes present-
at the limit of consciousness-is reached in the suffering called physical.
We find ourselves here backed up to being. We do not only know
suffering as a disagreeable sensation, accompanying the fact of being at
bay and struck; this fact is suffering itself, the "dead end" of the
contact. The whole acuity of suffering lies in the impossibility of fleeing
it, of being protected in oneself from oneself; it lies in being cut off from
every living spring. And it is the impossiblity of retreat. Here the only
future negation of the will in fear, the imminence of what escapes power,
is inserted into the present; here the other grasps me, the world affects,
touches the will. In suffering reality acts on the in itself of the will,
which turns despairingly into total submission to the will of the Other.
In suffering the will is defeated by sickness. In fear death is yet future,
at a distance from us; whereas suffering realizes in the will the extreme
proximity of the being menacing the will.
But we still witness this turning of the I into a thing; we are at the
same time a thing and at a distance from our reification, an abdication
minimally distant from abdication. Suffering remains ambiguous: it is
already the present of the pain acting on the for itself of the will, but, as
consciousness, the pain is always yet to come. In suffering the free being
ceases to be free, but, while non-free, is yet free. It remains at a distance
from this pain by its very consciousness, and consequently can become a
heroic will. This situation where the consciousness deprived of all
freedom of movement maintains a minimal distance from the present,
this ultimate passivity which nonetheless desperately turns into action
and into hope, is patience-the passivity of undergoing, and yet mastery
itself. In patience a disengagement within engagement is effected-
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                       239
neither the impassibility of a contemplation hovering over history nor
irrevocable engagement in its visible objectivity. The two positions
merge. The being that does violence to me and has a hold on me is not
yet upon me; it continues to threaten from the future, is not yet upon me,
is only conscious. But in this extreme consciousness, where the will
reaches mastery in a new sense, where death no longer touches it, ex-
treme passivity becomes extreme mastery. The egoism of the will stands
on the verge of an existence that no longer accents itself.
The supreme ordeal of freedom is not death, but suffering. This is
known very well in hatred, which seeks to grasp the ungraspable, to
humiliate, from on high, through the suffering in which the Other exists
as pure pass1v1ty. Hatred wills this passivity in the eminently active
being that is to bear witness to it. Hatred does not always desire the
death of the Other, or at least it desires the death of the Other only in
inflicting this death as a supreme suffering. The one who hates seeks to
be the cause of a suffering to which the despised being must be witness.
To inflict suffering is not to reduce the Other to the rank of object, but
on the contrary is to maintain him superbly in his subjectivity. In suf-
fering the subject must know his reification, but in order to do so he must
precisely remain a subject. Hatred wills both things. Whence the in-
satiable character of hatred; it is satisfied precisely when it is not satisfied,
since the Other satisfies it only by becoming an object, but can never
become object enough, since at the same time as his fall, his lucidity and
witness are demanded. In this lies the logical absurdity of hatred.
The supreme ordeal of the will is not death, but suffering. In
patience, at the limit of its abdication, the will does not sink into
absurdity, for--over and beyond the nothingness that would reduce the
space of time that elapses from birth to death to the purely subjective, the
interior, the illusory, the meaningless-the violence the will endures
comes from the other as a tyranny. But for this very reason it is
produced as an absurdity breaking out on the ground of signification.
Violence does not stop Discourse; all is not inexorable. Thus alone does
violence remain endurable in patience. It is produced only in a world
where I can die as a result of someone and for someone. This situates
death in a new context and modifies its conception, empties it of the
pathos that comes to it from the fact of its being my death. In other
words, in patience the will breaks through the crust of its egoism and as
it were displaces its center of gravity outside of itself, to will as Desire
and Goodness limited by nothing.
240                        Totality and Infinity
The analysis below will bring to light the dimension of fecundity,
from which, ultimately, flows the time of patience itself-and the dimen-
sion of the political, which we now encounter.


5. The Truth of the Will
The will is subjective-it does not keep hold on all its being, for with
death there comes to it an event that escapes its power absolutely. Death
marks the subjectivity of the will not as an end, but as supreme violence
and alienation. But in patience, where the will is transported to a life
against someone and for someone, death no longer touches the will. But
is this immunity true or simply subjective?
In raising this question we are not implying the existence of a real
sphere opposed to the inner life, which would be possibly inconsistent
and illusory. We seek to present the inner ilfe not as an epiphenome-
non and an appearance, but as an event of being, as the openness of a
dimension indispensable, in the economy of being, for the production of
infinity. The power for illusion is not a simple aberration of thought,
but a movement in being itself. It has an ontological import. The plane
of the inner life is that of apology; it is nowise to be sublated, under
pain of reducing anew the inner life to an epiphenomenon. But does
not apology of itself, precisely in escaping itself in death, call for a
confirmation, in which it escapes death? The apology demands a judg-
ment, not in order to pale under the light that would be projected upon
it and flee as an inconsistent shade, but rather in order to obtain
justice. Judgment would confirm the event of the apology in its original
and fundamental movement, ineluctable in the production of Infinity.
The will, whose spontaneity and mastery are belied by death, are stifled
in a historical context, that is, in the works that remain of them, of itself
seeks to place itself under a judgment, and to receive the truth from it
upon its own witness. What is this exisence the will enters into, placing
itself under a judgment that dominates the apology,-buntoes not reduce
it to silence? For does not judgment, the act of situating by reference
to infinity, necessarily have its source outside the being judged; does
it not come from the other, from history? But the other above all
alienates a will. The verdict of history is pronounced by the survivor
who no longer speaks to the being he judges, and to whom the will
appears and offers itself as a result and as a work. Thus the will seeks
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                      241
judgment in order to be confirmed against death, whereas judgment
taken as the judgment of history kills the will qua will.
This dialectical situation of the search for and the denial of justice has
a concrete meaning: the freedom that animates the elementary fact of
consciousness forthwith manifests its inanity as a paralytic's freedom and
as premature. Hegel's great meditation on freedom permits us to under-
stand that the good will by itself is not a true freedom as long as it does
not dispose of the means to realize itself. To proclaim the universality
of God in consciousness, to think that everything is consummated while
the peoples that tear one another to pieces belie this universality in fact, is
not only to prepare the irreligion of a Voltaire, but is to shock reason
itself. lnteriority cannot replace universality. Freedom is not realized
outside of social and political institutions, which open to it the access to
fresh air necessary for its expansion, its respiration, and even, per-
haps, its spontaneous generation. Apolitical freedom is to be ex-
plained as an illusion due to the fact that its partisans or its beneficiaries
belong to an advanced stage of political evolution. An existence that is
free, and not a velleity for freedom, presupposes a certain organization of
nature and of society ; the sufferings of torture, stronger than death, can
extinguish inward freedom. Even he who has accepted death is not
free. The insecurity of the morrow, hunger and thirst scoff at freedom.
And, to be sure, in the midst of torture understanding the reasons for the
torture reestablishes the famous inward freedom, in spite of the betrayal
and degradation portended. But these reasons themselves appear only
to the beneficiaries of historical evolution and institutions. In order
to oppose inward freedom to the absurd and its violence it is necessary to
have received an education.
Hence freedom would cut into the real only by virtue of institutions.
Freedom is engraved on the stone of the tables on which laws are
inscribed-it exists by virtue of this incrustation of an institutional exist-
ence. Freedom depends on a written text, destructible to be sure, but
durable, on which freedom is conserved for man outside of man. Human
freedom, exposed to violence and to death, does not reach its goal all at
once, with a Bergsonian elan; it takes refuge from its own perfidy in in-
stitutions. History is not an eschatology. The animal fabricating tools
frees itself from its animal condition when its momentum seems inter-
rupted and broken, when instead of going of itself to its goal as an in-
violable will it fabricates tools and fixes the powers of its future action in
transmissible and receivable things. Thus a political and technical
242                         Totality and Infinity
existence ensures the will its truth, renders it objective ( as we say
today), without opening upon goodness, without emptying it of its egoist
weight. The mortal will can escape violence by driving violence and
murder from the world, that is, by profiting from time to delay always
further the hours of expiration.
Objective judgment is pronounced by the very existence of rational in-
stitutions, in which the will is secured against death and against its own
perfidy. It consists in the submission of the subjective will to the univer-
sal laws which reduce the will to its objective signification. In the respite
that the postponement of death, or time, leaves to the will it relies
on institutions. It henceforth exists reflected by the public order, in the
equality which the universality of laws ensures it. Henceforth it exists
as though it were dead and signified only in its own heritage, as though
everything that was existence in the first person in it, subjective existence,
were but the aftereffect of its animality. But the will now knows
another tyranny: that of works alienated, already foreign to man, which
reawaken the ancient nostalgia for cynicism. There exists a tyranny of
the universal and of the impersonal, an order that is inhuman though
distinct from the brutish. Against it man affirms himself as an irreduci-
ble singularity, exterior to the totality into which he enters, and aspiring
to the religious order where the recognition of the individual concerns
him in his singularity, an order of joy which is neither cessation nor
antithesis of pain, nor flight before it ( as the Heideggerian theory of
Befindlichkeit would have us think). The judgment of history is always
pronounced in absentia. The will's absence from this judgment lies in
the fact that it is present there only in the third person. It figures in
this discourse as in an indirect discourse where it no longer bears unicity
and commencement, where it has already lost its voice. But speech in
the first person, direct discourse-useless for the objective wisdom of the
universal judgment, or simply a datum of its investigation-consists
precisely in incessantly supplying a datum to be added to what, being
object of universal wisdom, admits of no further ad junction. This word
is therefore not of the same sort as the other words of judgment. It
presents the will at its trial; it is produced as its defense. The subjec-
tivity's presence at the judgment which ensures it truth is not a purely
numerical fact of being there, but is an apology. The subjectivity cannot
maintain itself altogether in its apologetic position, and lays itself open to
the violence of death. To maintain itself entirely within its relation
with itself it would have to be able, over and beyond apology, to will its
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                      243
judgment. It is not the nothingness of death that has to be surmounted,
but the passivity to which the will is exposed inasmuch as it is mortal,
incapable of absolute attention or absolute vigilance, and necessarily
surprised, exposed to murder. But the possibility of seeing itself from
the outside does not harbor truth either, if I pay for it the price of my
depersonalization. In this judgment, by which the subjectivity is
maintained in being absolutely, the singularity and unicity of the I who
thinks must not be engulfed, as a result of having been absorbed into its
own thought and entered into its discourse. Judgment must be borne
upon a will that could defend itself during the adjudication and through
its apology be present at its trial, and does not disappear into the totality
of a coherent discourse.
The judgment of history is set forth in the visible. Historical events
are the visible par excellence; their truth is produced in evidence. The
visible forms, or tends to form, a totality. It excludes the apology,
which undoes the totality in inserting into it, at each instant, the unsur-
passable, unencompassable present of its very subjectivity. The judgment
at which the subjectivity is to remain apologetically present has to be
made against the evidence of history (and against philosophy, if philoso-
phy coincides with the evidence of history). The invisible must manifest
itself if history is to lose its right to the last word, necessarily unjust for
the subjectivity, inevitably cruel. But the manifestation of the invisible
can not mean the passage of the invisible to the status of the visible; it
does not lead back to evidence. It is produced in the goodness reserved
to subjectivity, which thus is subject not simply to the truth of judg-
ment, but to the source of this truth. The truth of the invisible is onto-
logically produced by the subjectivity which states it. For the invisible
is not the "provisionally invisible," nor what remains invisible for a
superficial and rapid glance, and which a more attentive and scrupulous
investigation would render visible, nor what remains unexpressed as
hidden movements of the soul, nor what, gratuitously and lazily, is
affirmed to be a mystery. The invisible is the offense that inevitably
results from the judgment of visible history, even if history unfolds
rationally. The virile judgment of history, the virile judgment of "pure
reason," is cruel. The universal norms of this judgment silence the
unicity in which the apology is contained and from which it draws its
arguments. Inasmuch as the invisible is ordered into a totality it of-
fends the subjectivity, since, by essence, the judgment of history consists
in translating every apology into visible arguments, and in drying up the
244                        Totality and I n/inity
inexhaustible source of the singularity from which they proceed and
against which no argument can prevail. For there can be no place for
singularity in a totality. The idea of a judgment of God represents the
limit idea of a judgment that, on the one hand, takes into account the in-
visible and essential offense to a singularity that results from judgment
( even a judgment that is rational and inspired by universal principles,
and consequently is visible and evident) and, on the other hand, is
fundamentally discreet, and does not silence by its majesty the voice and
the revolt of the apology. God sees the invisible and sees without being
seen. But how is that situation which we can call judgment of God,
and to which the will that wills in truth and not only subjectively sub-
mits, concretely brought about?
The invisible offense that results from the judgment of history, a
judgment on the visible, will attest subjectivity to be prior to judgment
or to be a refusal of judgment, if it is only produced as cry and protesta-
tion, if it is felt within me. But it is produced as judgment itself when it
looks at me and accuses me in the face of the Other-whose very epiph-
any is brought about by this offense suffered, by this status of being
stranger, widow, and orphan. The will is under the judgment of God
when its fear of death is inverted into fear of committing murder.
To be judged thus does not consist in hearing a verdict set forth
impersonally and implacably out of universal principles. Such a voice
would interrupt the direct discourse of the being subject to judgment,
would silence the apology, whereas the adjudication in which the defense
makes itself heard should confirm in truth the singularity of the will it
judges. But not by indulgence, which would indicate a lapse in the
judgment. The exaltation of the singularity in judgment is produced
precisely in the infinite responsibility of the will to which the judgment
gives rise. Judgment is pronounced upon me in the measure that it
summons me to respond. Truth takes form in this response to a sum-
mons. The summons exalts the singularity precisely because it is ad-
dressed to an infinite responsibility. The infinity of responsibility de-
notes not its actual immensity, but a responsibility increasing in the
measure that it is assumed; duties become greater in the measure that
they are accomplished. The better I accomplish my duty the fewer
rights I have; the more I am just the more guilty I am. The I, which
we have seen arise in enjoyment as a separated being having apart, in
itself, the center around which its existence gravitates, is confirmed in its
singularity by purging itself of this gravitation, purges itself intermina-
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                    245
bly, and is confirmed precisely in this incessant effort to purge itself.
This is termed goodness. Perhaps the possibility of a point of the
universe where such an overflow of responsibility is produced ultimately
defines the I.
In the justice that indicts my arbitrary and partial freedom I therefore
am not simply called upon to concur, to consent and assume--to seal my
pure and simple entry into the universal order, my abdication and the end
of the apology, whose remanence would then be interpreted as a residue
or aftereffect of animality. In reality, justice does not include me in
the equilibrium of its universality; justice summons me to go beyond
the straight line of justice, and henceforth nothing can mark the end of
this march; behind the straight line of the law the land of goodness ex-
tends infinite and unexplored, necessitating all the resources of a singu-
lar presence. I am therefore necessary for justice, as responsible beyond
every limit fixed by an objective law. The I is a privilege and an elec-
tion. The sole possibility in being of going beyond the straight line of the
law, that is, of finding a place lying beyond the universal, is to be I. The
morality called inward and subjective exercises a function which univer-
sal and objective law cannot exercise, but which it calls for. Truth
cannot be in tyranny, as it cannot be in the subjective. Truth can be
only if a subjectivity is called upon to tell it, in the sense that the
Psalmist exclaims: "The dust will give thanks to you, will tell your
truth." The call to infinite responsibility confirms the subjectivity in
its apologetic position. The dimension of its interiority is brought from
the level of the subjective to that of being. Judgment no longer alien-
ates the subjectivity, for it does not make it enter into and dissolve in the
order of an objective morality, but leaves it a dimension whereby it deep-
ens in itself. To utter "I," to affirm the irreducible singularity in which
the apology is pursued, means to possess a privileged place with regard to
responsibilities for which no one can replace me and from which no one
can release me. To be unable to shirk: this is the I. The personal
character of apology is maintained in this election by which the I is
accomplished qua I. The accomplishing of the I qua I and morality
constitute one sole and same process in being: morality comes to birth not
in equality, but in the fact that infinite exigencies, that of serving the
poor, the stranger, the widow, and the orphan, converge at one point of
the universe. Thus through morality alone are I and the others
produced in the universe. The alienable subjectivity of need and will,
which claims to be already and henceforth in possession of itself, but
246                         Totality and Infinity
which death makes mockery of, is transfigured by the election which
invests it, turning it toward the resources of its own interiority. These
resources are infinite--in the incessant overflowing of duty accomplished,
by ever broader responsibilities. The person is thus confirmed in objec-
tive judgment and no longer reduced to his place within a totality. But
this confirmation does not consist in flattering his subjective tendencies
and consoling him for his death, but in existing for the Other, that is, in
being called in question and in dreading murder more than death-a
salto mortale whose perilous space is opened forth and measured already
by patience ( and this is the meaning of suflering), but which the singular
being par excellence--an I-can alone accomplish. The truth of the
will lies in its coming under judgment; but its coming under judgment
lies in a new orientation of the inner life, called to infinite responsibili-
ties.
Justice would not be possible without the singularity, the unicity of
subjectivity. In this justice subjectivity does not figure as a formal
reason, but as individuality; formal reason is incarnate in a being only
in the measure that it loses its election and is equivalent to all the others.
Formal reason is incarnate only in a being who does not have the strength
to suppose that, under the visible that is history, there is the invisible
that is judgment.
The deepening of the inner life can no longer be guided by the
evidences of history. It is given over to risk and to the moral creation
of the I-to horizons more vast than history, in which history itself
is judged. Objective events and the evidence of philosophers can only
conceal these horizons. If subjectivity cannot be judged in Truth
without its apology, if judgment, instead of reducing it to silence,
exalts it, then there must be a discord between events and the good, or,
more exactly, events must have an invisible meaning which only a
subjectivity, a singular being, can determine. To place oneself beyond
the judgment of history, under the judgment of truth, is not to suppose
behind the apparent history another history called judgment of God-
but equally failing to recognize the subjectivity. To place oneself under
the judgment of God is to exalt the subjectivity, called to moral overstep-
ping beyond laws, which is henceforth in truth because it surpasses the
limits of its being. The judgment of God that judges me at the same
time confirms me. But it confirms me precisely in my interiority, whose
justice is more severe than the judgment of history. Concretely to be an
I presenting itself at a trial-which requires all the resources of sub-
C. The Ethical Relation and Time                     247
ject!Vlty-means for it to be able to see, beyond the universal judge-
ments of history, that offense of the offended which is inevitably pro-
duced in the very judgment issued from universal principles. What
is above all invisible is the offense universal history inflicts on particu-
lars. To be I and not only an incarnation of a reason is precisely to be
capable of seeing the offense of the offended, or the face. The deepening
of my responsibility in the judgment that is borne upon me is not
of the order of universalization: beyond the justice of universal laws,
the I enters under judgment by the fact of being good. Goodness
consists in taking up a position in being such that the Other counts more
than myself. Goodness thus involves the possibility for the I that is
exposed to the alienation of its powers by death to not be for death.
The inner life is exalted by the truth of being-by the existence of
being in the truth of judgment. It is indispensable for truth, being the
dimension in which something can be opposed clandestinely to the visible
judgment of history which seduces the philosopher. Yet this inner life
cannot forgo all visibility. The judgment of consciousness must refer to
a reality beyond the sentence pronounced by history, which is also aces-
sation and an end. Hence truth requires as its ultimate condition an
infinite time, the condition for both goodness and the transcendence
of the face. The fecundity of subjectivity, by which the I survives itself,
is a condition required for the truth of subjectivity, the clandestine
dimension of the judgment of God. But for this condition to be
realized, it is not enough that art infinite time be given.
It is necessary to go back to the primary phenomenon of time in which
the phenomenon of the "not yet" is rooted. It is necessary to go back to
paternity, without which time is but the image of eternity. Without it
the time necessary for the manifestation of truth behind visible history
(but which remains time-that is, is temporalized relative to a present
situated in itself and identifiable) would be impossible. Biological
fecundity is but one of the forms of paternity. Paternity, as a primordial
effectuation of time, can, among men, be borne by the biological life,
hut be lived beyond that life.
SECTION IV


## Beyond The Face
The relation with the Other does not nullify separation. It does not
arise within a totality nor does it establish a totality, integrating me and
the other. Nor does the face to face conjuncture presuppose the exist-
ence of universal truths into which subjectivity could be absorbed,
and which it would be enough to contemplate for me and the other to
enter into a relation of communion. Rather, here the converse thesis
must be maintained: the relation between me and the other commences in
the inequality of terms, transcendent to one another, where alterity does
not determine the other in a formal sense, as where the alterity of B with
respect to A results simply from the identity of B, distinct from the iden-
tity of A. Here the alterity of the other does not result from its identity,
but constitutes it: the other is the Other. The Other qua Other is situ-
ated in a dimension of height and of abasement-glorious abasement; he
has the face of the poor, the stranger, the widow, and the orphan, and, at
the same time, of the master called to invest and justify my freedom.
This inequality does not appear to the third party who would count us.
It precisely signifies the absence of a third party capable of taking in me
and the other, such that the primordial multiplicity is observed within
the very face to face that constitutes it. It is produced in multiple
singularities and not in a being exterior to this number who would
count the multiples. The inequality is in this impossibility of the
exterior point of view, which alone could abolish it. The relationship
that is established-the relationship of teaching, of mastery, of transitiv-
ity-is language, and is produced only in the speaker who, consequently,
himself faces. Language is not added to the impersonal thought domi-
nating the same and the other; impersonal thought is produced in the
movement that proceeds from the same to the other, and consequently in
251
252                        Totality and Infinity
the interpersonal and not only impersonal language. An order common
to the interlocutors is established by the positive act of the one giving the
world, his possession, to the other, or by the positive act of the one
justifying himself in his freedom before the other, that is, by apology.
Apology does not blindly affirm the self, but already appeals to the
Other. It is the primordial phenomenon of reason, in its insurmountable
bipolarity. The interlocutors as singularities, irreducible to the concepts
they constitute in communicating their world or in appealing to the
justification of the Other, preside over communication. Reason presup-
poses these singularities or particularities, not as individuals open to
conceptualization, or divesting themselves of their particularity so as to
find themselves to be identical, but precisely as interlocutors, irreplacea-
ble beings, unique in their genus, faces. The difference between the
two theses: "reason creates the relations between me and the other"
and "the Other's teaching me creates reason" is not purely theoretical.
The consciousness of the tyranny of the State-though it be rational-
makes this difference actual. Does the impersonal reason, to which man
rises in the third stage of knowledge, leave him outside of the State?
Does it spare him all violence? Does it make him confess that this con-
straint obstructs nothing but the animal in him? The freedom of the I
is neither the arbitrariness of an isolated being nor the conformity
of an isolated being with a rational and universal law incumbent upon all.
My arbitrary freedom reads its shame in the eyes that look at me. It is
apologetic, that is, refers already from itself to the judgment of the Other
which it solicits, and which thus does not offend it as a limit. It thus
reveals itself to be contrary to the conception for which every alterity
is an offense. It is not a causa sui simply diminished or, as it is put,
finite. For if this freedom were partially negated, it would be negated
totally. By reason of my apologetic position, my being is not called
upon to appear to itself in its reality: my being does not equal its ap-
parition in consciousness.
But neither will my being be what I have been for the others in terms
of an impersonal reason. If I am reduced to my role in history I remain
as unrecognized as I was deceptive when I appeared in my own con-
sciousness. Existence in history consists in placing my consciousness
outside of me and in destroying my responsibility.
The inhumanity of a humanity where the self has its consciousness
outside of itself resides in the consciousness of the violence that is within
oneself. The renunciation of one's partiality as an individual is imposed
Beyond the Face                            253
as though by a tyranny. Moreover, if the partiality of the individual,
understood as the very principle of his individuation, is a principle of
incoherence, by what magic would the simple addition of incoherencies
produce a coherent impersonal discourse, and not the disordered din of
the crowd? My individuality is hence quite different from this animal
partiality, to which would be added a reason that issues from the
contradiction in which the hostile impulses of animal particularities
oppose one another. Its singularity is at the very level of its reason;
it is apology, that is, personal discourse, from me to the others. My
being is produced in producing itself before the others in discourse; it is
what it reveals of itself to the others, but while participating in, attend-
ing, its revelation. I am in truth by being produced in history under the
judgment it bears upon me, but under the judgment that it bears upon
me in my presence-that is, while letting me speak. We have shown
above the issuance of this apologetic disclosure in goodness. The differ-
ence between "to appear in history" ( without a right to speak) and to
appear to the Other while attending one's own apparition distinguishes
again my political being from my religious being.
In my religious being I am in truth. Will the violence death intro-
duces into this being make truth impossible? Does not the violence of
death reduce to silence the subjectivity without which truth could neither
be said nor be-or ( to put it in a word, the word so often used in this ex-
position, and which includes appearing and being) without which truth
could not be produced'! -Unless, revolted by the violence of reason that
reduces the apology to silence, the subjectivity could not only accept to be
silent, but could renounce itself by itself, renounce itself without violence,
cease the apology for itself. This would not be a suicide nor a resigna-
tion, but would be love. The submission to tyranny, the resignation to a
universal law, though it be rational, which stops the apology, compro-
mises the truth of my being.
Hence we must indicate a plane both presupposing and transcending
the epiphany of the Other in the face, a plane where the I bears itself
beyond death and recovers also from its return to itself. This plane is
that of love and fecundity, where subjectivity is posited in function of
these movements.
## A. The Ambiguity Of Love


The metaphysical event of transcendence-the welcome of the Other,
hospitality-Desire and language-is not accomplished as love. But the
transcendence of discourse is bound to love. We shall show how in love
transcendence goes both further and less far than language.
Has love no other term than a person? The person here enjoys a
privilege-the loving intention goes unto the Other, unto the friend, the
child, the brother, the beloved, the parents. But a thing, an abstraction,
a book can likewise be objects of love. It is that by an essential aspect
love, which as transcendence goes unto the Other, throws us back this
side of immanence itself: it designates a movement by which a being seeks
that to which it was bound before even having taken the initiative of the
search and despite the exteriority in which it finds it. The supreme
adventure is also a predestination, a choice of what had not been chosen.
Love as a relation with the Other can be reduced to this fundamental
immanence, be divested of all transcendence, seek but a connatural being,
a sister soul, present itself as incest. The myth Aristophanes tells in
Plato's Symposium, in which love reunites the two halves of one sole
being, interprets the adventure as a return to self. The enjoyment
justifies this interpretation. It brings into relief the ambiguity of an
event situated at the limit of immanence and transcendence. This desire
-a movement ceaselessly cast forth, an interminable movement toward a
future never future enough-is broken and satisfied as the most egoist
and cruelist of needs. It is as though the too great audacity of the loving
transcendence were paid for by a throw-back this side of need. But this
this side itself, by the depths of the unavowable to which it leads, by the
occult influence it exercises over all the powers of being, bears witness to
an exceptional audacity. Love remains a relation with the Other that
turns into need, and this need still presupposes the total, transcendent
exteriority of the other, of the beloved. But love also goes beyond the
beloved. This is why through the face filters the obscure light coming
from beyond the face, from what is not yet, from a future never future
254
A. The Ambiguity of Love                         255
enought more remote than the possible. An enjoyment of the transcend-
ent almost contradictory in its terms, love is stated with truth neither in
erotic talk where it is interpreted as sensation nor in the spiritual
language which elevates it to being a desire of the transcendent. The
possibility of the Other appearing as an object of a need while retaining
his alterity, or againt the possibility of enjoying the Other, of placing
oneself at the same time beneath and beyond discourse-this position
with regard to the interlocutor which at the same time reaches him and
goes beyond himt this simultaneity of need and desire, of concupiscence
and transcendence, tangency of the avowable and the unavowablet consti-
tutes the originality of the erotic whicht in this sense, is the equivocal par
excellence.
## B. Phenomenology Of Eros


Love aims at the Other; it aims at him in his frailty [faiblesse].
Frailty does not here figure the inferior degree of any attribute, the
relative deficiency of a determination common to me and the other.
Prior to the manifestation of attributes, it qualifies alterity itself. To
love is to fear for another, to come to the assistance of his frailty. In this
frailty as in the dawn rises the Loved, who is the Beloved.• An
epiphany of the Loved, the feminine is not added to an object and a
Thou antecedently given or encountered in the neuter ( the sole gender
formal logic knows). The epiphany of the Beloved is but one with her
regime of tenderness. The way of the tender consists in an extreme
fragility, a vulnerability. It manifests itself at the limit of being and
non-being, as a soft warmth where being dissipates into radiance, like the
"pale blush" of the nymphs in the Afternoon of a Faun, which "leaps in
the air drowsy with thick slumbers," dis-individualizing and relieving
itself of its own weight of being, already evanescence and swoon, flight
into self in the very midst of its manifestation. And in this flight the
other is other, foreign to the world too coarse and too offensive for him.
And yet this extreme fragility lies also at the limit of an existence
"without ceremonies," "without circumlocutions," a "non-signifying"
and raw density, an exorbitant ultramateriality. These superlatives,
better than metaphors, denote a sort of paroxysm of materiality.
Ultramateriality does not designate a simple absence of the human in
the piles of rocks and sands of a lunar landscape, nor the materiality
that outdoes itself, gaping under its rent forms, in ruins and wounds; it
designates the exhibitionist nudity of an exorbitant presence coming as
though from farther than the frankness of the face, already profaning
and wholly profaned, as if it had forced the interdiction of a secret. The
essentially hidden throws itself toward the light, without l,ecoming signi-
fication. Not nothingness--but what is not yet. This unreality at the

• " •.. l'Aime qui eat Aimee."
256
B. Phenomenology of Eros                      257
threshold of the real does not offer itself as a possible to be grasped ; the
clandestinity does not describe a gnoseological accident that occurs to a
being. "Being not yet" is not a this or a that; clandestinity exhausts the
essence of this non-essence. In the effrontery of its production this clan-
destinity avows a nocturnal life not equivalent to a diurnal life simply
deprived of light; it is not equivalent to the simple inwardness of a
solitary and inward life which would seek expression in order to over-
come its repression. It refers to the modesty it has profaned without
overcoming. The secret appears without appearing, not because it would
appear half-way, or with reservations, or in confusion. The simultaneity
of the clandestine and the exposed precisely defines profanation. It
appears in equivocation. But it is profanation that permits equivocation
--essentially erotic-and not the reverse. Modesty, insurmountable in
love, constitutes its pathos. Immodesty, always dared in the presentation
of wanton nudity, is not something added to an antecedent neutral
perception, such as that of the doctor who examines the nudity of the
patient. The mode in which erotic nudity is produced ( is presented and
is) delineates the original phenomena of immodesty and profanation.
The moral perspectives they open are situated already in the singular
dimension opened by this exorbitant exhibitionism, which is a produc-
tion of being.
Let us in passing note that this depth in the subterranean dimension of
the tender prevents it from being identified with the graceful, which it
nevertheless resembles. The simultaneity or the equivocation of this
fragility and this weight of non-signifyingness [non-significance], heavier
than the weight of the formless real, we shall term femininity.
The movement of the lover before this frailty of femininity, neither
pure compassion nor impassiveness, indulges in compassion,• is absorbed
in the complacence of the caress.
The caress, like contact, is sensibility. But the caress transcends the
sensible. It is not that it would feel beyond the felt, further than the
senses, that it would seize upon a sublime food while maintaining, within
its relation with this ultimate felt, an intention of hunger that goes unto
the food promised, and given to, and deepening this hunger, as though the
caress would be fed by its own hunger. The caress consists in seizing
upon nothing, in soliciting what ceaselessly escapes its form toward a
future never future enough, in soliciting what slips away as though it

• ". . . 1e complatt dan1 la compa111ion . . ."
258                       Totality and Infinity
were not yet. It searches, it forages. It is not an intentionality of
disclosure but of search: a movement unto the invisible. In a certain
sense it expresses love, but suffers from an inability to tell it. It is
hungry for this very expression, in an unremitting increase of hunger. It
thus goes further than to its term, it aims beyond an existent however
future, which, precisely as an existent, knocks already at the gates of
being. The desire that animates it is reborn in its satisfaction, fed
somehow by what is not yet, bringing us back to the virginity, forever
inviolate, of the feminine. It is not that the caress would seek to
dominate a hostile freedom, to make of it its object or extort from it a
consent. Beyond the consent or the resistance of a freedom the caress
seeks what is not yet, a "less than nothing," closed and dormant beyond
the future, consequently dormant quite otherwise than the possible,
which would be open to anticipation. The profanation which insinuates
itself in caressing responds adequately to the originality of this dimen-
sion of absence--an absence other than the void of an abstract nothing-
ness, an absence referring to being, but referring to it in its own way, as
though the "absences" of the future were not all future on the same level
and uniformedly. Anticipation grasps possibles; what the caress seeks is
not situated in a perspective and in the light of the graspable. The
carnal, the tender par excellence correlative of the caress, the beloved,
is to be identified neither with the body-thing of the physiologist, nor
with the lived body [ corps prop re] of the "I can," nor with the body-
expression, attendance at its own manifestation, or face. In the caress,
a relation yet, in one aspect, sensible, the body already denudes itself
of its very form, offering itself as erotic nudity. In the carnal given
to tenderness, the body quits the status of an existent.
The Beloved, at once graspable but intact in her nudity, beyond object
and face and thus beyond the existent, abides in virginity. The feminine
essentially violable and inviolable, the "Eternal Feminine," is the virgin
or an incessant recommencement of virginity, the untouchable in the very
contact of voluptuosity, future in the present. Not as a freedom strug-
gling with its conqueror, refusing its reification and its objectification,
but a fragility at the limit of non-being wherein is lodged not only what
is extinguished and is no longer, but what is not yet. The virgin re-
mains ungraspable, dying without murder, swooning, withdrawing into
her future, beyond every possible promised to anticipation. Alongside
of the night as anonymous rustling of the there is extends the night of
the erotic, behind the night of insomnia the night of the hidden, the
B. Phenomenology of Eros                        259
clandestine, the mysterious, land of the virgin, simultaneously uncovered
by Eros and refusing Eros-another way of saying: profanation.
The caress aims at neither a person nor a thing. It loses itself in a
being that dissipates as though into an impersonal dream without will
and even without resistance, a passivity, an already animal or infantile
anonymity, already entirely at death. The will of the tender is produced
in its evanescence as though rooted in an animality ignorant of its death,
immersed in the false security of the elemental, in the infantile not
knowing what is happening to it. But also vertiginous depth of what is
not yet, which is not, but with a nonexistence not even having with
being the kinship that an idea or a project maintains, with a nonexistence
that does not claim, in any of these ways, to be an avatar of what is.
The caress aims at the tender which has no longer the status of an
"existent," which having taken leave of "numbers and beings" is not
even a quality of an existent. The tender designates a way, the way of
remaining in the no man's land between being and not-yet-being. A way
that does not even signal itself as a signification, that in no way shines
forth, that is extinguished and swoons, essential frailty of the Beloved
produced as vulnerable and as mortal.
But precisely in the evanescence and swoon of the tender the subject
does not project itself toward the future of the possible. The not-yet-
being is not to be ranked in the same future in which everything I can
realize already crowds, scintillating in the light, offering itself to my
anticipations and soliciting my powers. The not-yet-being is precisely
not a possible that would only be more remote than other possibles. The
caress does not act, does not grasp possibles. The secret it forces does not
inform it as an experience; it overwhelms the relation of the I with itself
and with the non-I. An amorphous non-I sweeps away the I into an
absolute future where it escapes itself and loses its position as a subject.
Its "intention" no longer goes forth unto the light, unto the meaningful.
Wholly passion, it is compassion for the passivity,* the suffering, the
evanescence of the tender. It dies with this death and suffers with this
suffering. Being moved [Attendrissement] suffering without suffering,
it is consoled already, complacent in its suffering. Being moved is a pity
that is complacent, a pleasure, a suffering transformed into happiness-
voluptuosity. And in this sense voluptuosity begins already in erotic
desire and remains desire at each instant. Voluptuosity does not come

• "Toute passion, elle compatit a Ia passivite .•."
260                        Totality and Infinity
to gratify desire; it is this desire itself. This is why voluptuosity is not
only impatient, but is impatience itself, breathes impatience and chokes
with impatience, surprised by its end, for it goes without going to an end.
Voluptuosity, as profanation, discovers the hidden as hidden. An ex-
ceptional relation is thus accomplished in a conjuncture which, for formal
logic, would arise from contradiction: the discovered* does not lose its
mystery in the discovery, the hidden is not disclosed, the night is not
dispersed. The profanation-discovery abides in modesty, be it under
the guise of immodesty: the clandestine uncovered does not acquire the
status of the disclosed. To discover here means to violate, rather than to
disclose a secret. A violation that does not recover from its own audacity
-the shame of the profanation lowers the eyes that should have scruti-
nized the uncovered. The erotic nudity says the inexpressible, but the
inexpressible is not separable from this saying in the way a mysterious ob-
ject foreign to expression is separated from a clear speech that seeks to
circumscribe it. The mode of "saying" or of "manifesting" itself hides
while uncovering, says and silences the inexpressible, harasses and pro-
vokes. The "saying," and not only the said, is equivocal. The equivocal
does not play between two meanings of speech, but between speech and
the renouncement of speech, between the signifyingness [significance] of
language and the non-signifyingness of the lustful which silence yet
dissimulates. Voluptuosity profanes; it does not see. An intentionality
without vision, discovery does not shed light: what it discovers does not
present itself as signification and illuminates no horizon. The feminine
presents a face that goes beyond the face. The face of the beloved does
not express the secret that Eros profanes; it ceases to express, or, if one
prefers, it expresses only this refusal to express, this end of discourse and
of decency, this abrupt interruption of the order of presences. In the
feminine face the purity of expression is already troubled by the equivoca-
tion of the voluptuous. Expression is inverted into indecency, already
close on to the equivocal which says less than nothing, already laughter
and raillery.
In this sense voluptuosity is a pure experience, an experience which
does not pass into any concept, which remains blindly experience.
Profanation, the revelation of the hidden as hidden, constitutes a model
of being irreducible to intentionality, which is objectifying even in praxis,

• Throughout this section dlcouvrir and its cognates suggest that we under-
1tand "discovering" aa an "uncovering."-Trans.
B. Phenomenology of Eros                        261
for not taking leave of "numbers and beings." Love is not reducible to a
knowledge mixed with affective elements which would open to it an
unforeseen plane of being. It grasps nothing, issues in no concept, does
not issue, has neither the subject-object structure nor the I-thou struc-
ture. Eros is not accomplished as a subject that fixes an object, nor as a
pro-jection, toward a possible. I ts movement consists in going beyond
the possible.
The non-signifyingness of erotic nudity does not precede the signify-
ingness of the face as the obscurity of formless matter precedes the artist's
forms. It already has forms behind it; it comes from the future,
from a future situated beyond the future wherein possibles scintillate,
for the chaste nudity of the face does not vanish in the exhibitionism of
the erotic. The indiscretion in which it remains mysterious and ineffable
precisely is attested by the exorbitant inordinateness of this indiscretion.
Only the being that has the frankness of the face can be "discovered" in
the non-signifyingness of the wanton [lascif].
Let us recall what is involved in signification. The first instance of
signification is produced in the face. Not that the face would receive a
signification by relation to something. The face signifies by itself; its
signification precedes Sinngebung. A meaningful behavior arises already
in its light; it spreads the light in which light is seen. One does not have
to explain it, for every explanation begins with it. In other words,
society with the Other, which marks the end of the absurd rumbling of
the there is, is not constituted as the work of an I giving meaning. It is
necessary to already be for the Other-to exist and not to work only-
for the phenomenon of meaning, correlative of the intention·of a thought,
to arise. Being-for-the-Other must not suggest any finality and not
imply the antecedent positing or valorization of any value. To be for
the Other is to be good. The concept of the Other has, to be sure, no
new content with respect to the concept of the I: but being-for-the Other
is not a relation between concepts whose comprehension would coincide,
or the conception of a concept by an I, but my goodness. The fact that
in existing for another I exist otherwise than in existing for me is
morality itself. On all sides it envelops my knowledge of the Other, and
is not disengaged from the knowledge of the Other by a valorization of
the Other over and above this primary knowledge. Transcendence as
such is "conscience." Conscience accomplishes metaphysics, if meta-
physics consists in transcending. In all that precedes we have sought to
expose the epiphany of the face as the origin of exteriority. The
262                         Totality and Infinity
primary phenomenon of signification coincides with exteriority; exterio-
rity is signifyingness itself. And only the face in its morality is exterior.
In this epiphany the face is not resplendent as a form clothing a content,
as an image, but as the nudity of the principle, behind which there is
nothing further. The dead face becomes a form, a mortuary mask; it
is shown instead of letting see-but precisely thus no longer appears as a
face.
We can say it yet otherwise: exteriority defines the existent as existent,
and the signification of the face is due to an essential coinciding of the
existent and the signifier. Signification is not added to the existent. To
signify is not equivalent to presenting oneself as a sign, but to expressing
oneself, that is, presenting oneself in person. The symbolism of the sign
already presupposes the signification of expression, the face. In the face
the existent par excellence presents itself. And the whole body-a hand
or a curve of the shoulder--can express as the face. The primordial
signifyingness of the existent, its presentation in person or its expression,
its way of incessantly upsurging outside of its plastic image, is produced
concretely as a temptation to total negation, and as the infinite resistance
to murder, in the other qua other, in the hard resistance of these eyes
without protection-what is softest and most uncovered. The existent
qua existent is produced only in morality. Language, source of all signifi-
cation, is born in the vertigo of infinity, which takes hold before the
straightforwardness of the face, making murder possible and impossible.
The principle "you shall not commit murder," the very signifyingness
of the face, seems contrary to the mystery which Eros profanes, and which
is announced in the femininity of the tender. In the face the Other
expresses his eminence, the dimension of height and divinity from which
he descends. In his gentleness dawns his strength and his right. The
frailty of femininity invites pity for what, in a sense, is not yet, disrespect
for what exhibits itself in immodesty and is not discovered despite the
exhibition, that is, is profaned.
But disrespect presupposes the face. Elements and things remain
outside of respect and disrespect. It is necessary that the face have been
apperceived for nudity to be able to acquire the non-sign.ifyingness of the
lustful. The feminine face joins this clarity and this shadow. The
feminine is the face in which trouble surrounds and already invades
clarity. The in appearance asocial relation of eros will have a reference
-be it negative-to the social. In this inversion of the face in feminin-
ity, in this disfigurement that refers to the face, non-signifyingness abides
B. Phenomenology of Eros                         263
in the signifyingness of the face. This presence of non-signifyingness in
the signifyingness of the face, or this reference of the non-signifyingness
to signifyingness-where the chastity and decency of the face abides at
the limit of the obscene yet repelled but already close at hand and
promising-is the primordial event of feminine beauty, of that eminent
sense that beauty assumes in the feminine. The artist will have to
convert this beauty into "weightless grace" by carving in the cold matter
of color or stone, where beauty will become calm presence, sovereignty in
flight, existence unfounded for without foundations.• The beautiful of
art inverts the beauty of the feminine face. It substitutes an image for
the troubling depth of the future, of the "less than nothing" ( and not the
depth of a world) announced and concealed by the feminine beauty. It
presents a beautiful form reduced to itself in flight, deprived of its depth.
Every work of art is painting and statuary, immobilized in the instant
or in its periodic return. Poetry substitutes a rhythm for the feminine
life. Beauty becomes a form covering over indifferent matter, and not
harboring mystery.
Thus erotic nudity is as it were an inverted signification, a signification
that signifies falsely, a clarity converted into ardor and night, an expres-
sion that ceases to express itself, that expresses its renunciation of
expression and speech, that sinks into the equivocation of silence, a word
that bespeaks not a meaning but exhibition. Here lies the very lasci-
viousness of erotic nudity-the laughter that deflagrates in Shakespear-
ean witches' sessions full of innuendos, beyond the decency of words, as
the absence of all seriousness, of all possibility for speech, the laughter of
"ambiguous tales" where the mechanism of laughter is not only ascriba-
ble to the formal conditions of the comic such as Bergson, for example,
has defined them in his book Laughter-there is in addition a content
which brings us to an order where seriousness is totally lacking. The
beloved is opposed to me not as a will struggling with my own or subject
to my own, but on the contrary as an irresponsible animality which does
not speak true words. The beloved, returned to the stage of infancy
without responsibility-this coquettish head, this youth, this pure life
"a bit silly"-has quit her status as a person. The face fades, and in its
impersonal and inexpressive neutrality is prolonged, in ambiguity,
into animality. The relations with the Other are enacted in play; one
plays with the Other as with a young animal.

264                          Totality and Infinity
The non-signifyingness of the wanton is therefore not equivalent to the
stupid indifference of matter. As the reverse of expression of what has
lost expression, it thereby refers to the face. The being that presents
itself as identical in its face loses its signification by reference to the secret
profaned, and plays in equivocation. Equivocation constitutes the epiph-
any of the feminine--at the same time interlocutor, collaborator and
master superiorly intelligent, so often dominating men in the masculine
civilization it has entered, and woman having to be treated as a woman,
in accordance with rules imprescriptible by civil society. The face,
all straightforwardness and frankness, in its feminine epiphany dissimu-
lates allusions, innuendos. It laughs under the cloak of its own expres-
sion, without leading to any specific meaning, hinting in the empty air,
signaling the less than nothing.
The violence of this revelation marks precisely the force of this
absence, this not yet, this less than nothing, audaciously torn up from its
modesty, from its essence of being hidden. A not yet more remote than a
future, a temporal not yet, evincing degrees in nothingness. Hence Eros
is a ravishing beyond every project, beyond every dynamism, radical
indiscretion, profanation and not disclosure of what already exists as
radiance and signification. Eros hence goes beyond the face. Not that
the face would cover over something more by its decency, like a mask of
another face. The immodest apparition of erotic nudity weighs down
the face, weighing a monstrous weight in the shadow of non-sense that is
projected upon it, not because another face arises behind it, but because
the hidden is torn up from its modesty. The hidden, and not a hidden
existent or a possibility for an existent; the hidden, what is not yet and
what consequently lacks quiddity totally. Love does not simply lead, by
a more detoured or more direct way, toward the Thou. It is bent in
another direction than that wherein one encounters the Thou. The
hidden-never hidden enough-is beyond the personal and as its reverse,
refractory to the light, a category exterior to the play of being and
nothingness, beyond the possible, for absolutely ungraspable. Its way
beyond the possible is manifested in the non-sociality of the society of
lovers, their refusal to give themselves over in the midst of their abandon,
this refusal to surrender themselves that constitutes voluptuosity, fed by
its own hungers, approaching, in vertigo, the hidden or the feminine, a
non-personal, but into which the personal will not be engulfed.
The relationship established between lovers in voluptuosity, funda-
mentally refractory to universalization, is the very contrary of the social
B. Phenomenology of Eros                        265
relation. It excludes the third party, it remains intimacy, dual solitude,
closed society, the supremely non-public. The feminine is the other
refractory to society, member of a dual society, an intimate society, a
society without language. Its intimacy is to be described. For the
unparalleled relation voluptuosity maintains with the non-signifying con-
stitutes a complex that is not reducible to the repetition of this non, but
to positive traits by which the future and what is not yet ( and is not
simply an existent that remains at the status of the possible) is, so to
speak, determined.
The impossibility of reducing voluptuosity to the social, the non-signi-
fyingness upon which it opens, and which is manifested in the indecency
of the language that would state voluptuosity, isolates the lovers, as
though they were alone in the world. This solitude does not only
deny, does not only forget the world; the common action of the
sentient and the sensed which voluptuosity accomplishes closes, encloses,
seals the society of the couple. The non-sociality of voluptuosity is,
positively, the community of sentient and sensed: the other is not only
a sensed, but in the sensed is affirmed as sentient, as though one
same sentiment were substantially common to me and to the other-
and not in the way two observers have a common landscape or two
thinkers a common idea. An identical objective content does not here
mediate the community, nor is the community due to the analogy of
feeling; it is due to the identity of the feeling. Reference of love "given"
to love "received," love of love, voluptuosity is not a sentiment to the
second power like a reflection, but direct like a spontaneous consciousness.
It is inward and yet intersubjectively structured, not simplifying itself
into consciousness that is one. In voluptuosity the other is me and
separated from me. The separation of the Other in the midst of this
community of feeling constitutes the acuity of voluptuosity. The volup-
tuous in voluptuosity is not the freedom of the other tamed, objectified,
reified, but his freedom untamed, which I nowise desire objectified. But
it is freedom desired and voluptuous not in the clarity of his face, but in
the obscurity and as though in the vice of the clandestine, or in the future
that remains clandestine within discovery, and which, precisely for this
reason, is unfailingly profanation. Nothing is further from Eros than
possession. In the possession of the Other I possess the Other inasmuch
as he possesses me; I am both slave and master. Voluptuosity would
be extinguished in possession. But on the other hand, the impersonality
of voluptuosity prevents us from taking the relation between lovers to
266                         Totality and Infinity
be a complementarity. Voluptuosity hence aims not at the Other but
at his voluptuosity; it is voluptuosity of voluptuosity, love of the love
of the other. Love accordingly does not represent a particular case of
friendship. Love and friendship are not only felt differently; their
correlative differs: friendship goes unto the Other; love seeks what does
not have the structure of an existent, the infinitely future, what is to be
engendered. I love fully only if the Other loves me, not because I
need the recognition of the Other, but because my voluptuosity delights
in his voluptuosity, and because in this unparalleled conjuncture of
identification, in this trans-substantiation, the same and the other are not
united but precisely-beyond every possible project, beyond every mean-
ingful and intelligent power--engender the child.
If to love is to love the love the Beloved bears me, to love is also to love
oneself in love, and thus to return to oneself. Love does not transcend
unequivocably-it is complacent, it is pleasure and dual egoism. But
in this complacence it equally moves away from itself; it abides in a
vertigo above a depth of alterity that no signification clarifies any
longer-a depth exhibited and profaned. Already the relation with
the child-the coveting of the child, both other and myself-takes form
in voluptuosity, to be accomplished in the child himself (as can be ac-
complished a Desire that is not extinguished in its end nor appeased 'in its
satisfaction). We are here before a new category: before what is
behind the gates of being, before the less than nothing that eros tears
from its negativity and profanes. It is a question of a nothingness
distinct from the nothingness of anxiety: the nothingness of the future
buried in the secrecy of the less than nothing.
## C. Fecundity


The profanation that violates a secret does not "discover," beyond the
face, another more profound I which this face would express; it discovers
the child. By a total transcendence, the transcendence of trans-substan-
tiation, the I is, in the child, an other. Paternity remains a self-identifi-
cation, but also a distinction within identification-a structure unforesee-
able in formal logic. Hegel in the writings of his youth was able to say
that the child is the parents, and in W eltalter Schelling was able for
theological needs to deduce filiality from the identity of Being.
Possession of the child by the father does not exhaust the meaning of the
relationship that is accomplished in paternity, where the father discovers
himself not only in the gestures of his son, but in his substance and his
unici ty. My child is a stranger ( Isaiah 49} , but a stranger who is not
only mine, for he is me. He is me a stranger to myself. He is not only
my work, my creature, even if like Pygmalion I should see my work
restored to life. The son coveted in voluptuosity is not given to action,
remains unequal to powers. No anticipation represents him nor, as is
said today, projects him. The project invented or created, unwonted
and new, emanates from a solitary head to illuminate and to comprehend.
It dissolves into light and converts exteriority into idea. Whence we can
define power as presence in a world that by right resolves itself into my
ideas. But the encounter with the Other as feminine is required in order
that the future of the child come to pass from beyond the possible, beyond
projects. This relationship resembles that which was described for the
idea of infinity: l cannot account for it by myself, as I do account for the
luminous world by myself. This future is neither the Aristotelian germ
(less than being, a lesser being) nor the Heideggerian possibility which
constitutes being itself, but transforms the relation with the future
into a power of the subject. Both my own and non-mine, a possibility of
myself but also a possibility of the other, of the Beloved, my future does
not enter into the logical essence of the possible. The relation with such
a future, irreducible to the power over possibles, we shall call fecundity.
267
268                        Totality and Infinity
Fecundity encloses a duality of the Identical. It does not denote all
that I can grasp-my possibilities; it denotes my future, which is not a
future of the same-not a new avatar: not a history and events that can
occur to a residue of identity, an identity holding on by a thread, an I
that would ensure the continuity of the avatars. And yet it is my
adventure still, and consequently my future in a very new sense, despite
the discontinuity. Voluptuosity does not depersonalize the I ecstatically;
it remains ever desire, ever search. It is not extinguished in a term in
which it would be absorbed by breaking with its origin in me, even if it
does not entirely return to me-to my old age and my death. The I
as subject and support of powers does not exhaust the "concept" of the I,
does not command all the categories in which subjectivity, origin, and
identity are produced. Infinite being, that is, ever recommencing being
-which could not bypass subjectivity, for it could not recommence
without it-is produced in the guise of fecundity.
The relation with the child-that is, the relation with the other that is
not a power, but fecundity-establishes relationship with the absolute
future, or infinite time. The other that I will be does not have the
indetermination of the possible, which does, however, bear the trace of
the fixity of the I that grasps that possible. In power the indetermina-
tion of the possible does not exclude the reiteration of the I, which in
venturing toward this indeterminate future falls back on its feet, and,
riveted to itself, acknowledges its transcendence to be merely illusory and
its freedom to delineate but a fate. The diverse forms Proteus assumes
do not liberate him from his identity. In fecundity the tedium of this
repetition ceases; the I is other and young, yet the ipseity that ascribed to
it its meaning and its orientation in being is not lost in this renouncement
of self. Fecundity continues history without producing old age. Infinite
time does not bring an eternal life to an aging subject; it is better across
the discontinuity of generations, punctuated by the inexhaustible youths
of the child.
In fecundity the I transcends the world of light-not to dissolve into
the anonymity of the there is, but in order to go further than the light, to
go elsewhere. To stand in the light, to see-to grasp before grasping-is
not yet "to be infinitely"; it is to return to oneself older, that is,
encumbered with oneself. To be infinitely means to be produced in the
mode of an I that is always at the origin, but that meets with no trammels
to the renewal of its substance, not even from its very identity. Youth as
a philosophical concept is defined thus. The relation with the son in
C. Fecundity                              269
fecundity does not maintain us in this closed expanse of light and dream,
cognitions and powers. It articulates the time of the absolutely other, an
alteration of the very substance of him who can___.his trans-substantia-
tion.
That infinite being not be a possibility enclosed within the separated
being, but that it be produced as fecundity, involving, therefore, the
alterity of the Beloved, indicates the vanity of pantheism. That in
fecundity the personal I has its place indicates the end of the terrors
whereby the transcendence of the sacred, inhuman, anonymous, and
neuter, menaces persons with nothingness or with ecstasy. Being is
produced as multiple and as split into same and other; this is its ultimate
structure. It is society, and hence it is time. We thus leave the philoso-
phy of Parmenidean being. Philosophy itself constitutes a moment of
this temporal accomplishment, a discourse always addressed to another.
What we are now exposing is addressed to those who shall wish to
read it.
Transcendence is time and goes unto the Other. But the Other is
not a term: he does not stop the movement of Desire. The other that
Desire desires is again Desire; transcendence transcends toward him
who transcends-this is the true adventure of paternity, of the trans-
substantiation which permits going beyond the simple renewal of the
possible in the inevitable senescence of the subject. Transcendence, the
for the Other, the goodness correlative of the face, founds a more
profound relation: the goodness of goodness. Fecundity engendering
fecundity accomplishes goodness: above and beyond the sacrifice that
imposes a gift, the gift of the power of giving, the conception of the child.
Here the Desire which in the first pages of this work we contrasted with
need, the Desire that is not a lack, the Desire that is the independence of
the separated being and its transcendence, is accomplished-not in being
satisfied and in thus acknowledging that it was a need, but in transcend-
ing itself, in engendering Desire.
## D. The Subjectivity In Eros


Voluptuosity, as the coinciding of the lover and the beloved, is charged
by their duality: it is simultaneously fusion and distinction. The main-
tenance of duality does not mean that in love the egoism of the lover
wills to obtain the testimony of a recognition in the love received. To
love to be loved is not an intention, is not the thought of a subject
thinking his voluptuosity and thus finding himself exterior to the commu-
nity of the sensed ( despite the cerebral extrapolations of voluptuosity
possible, despite the desire for reciprocity guiding lovers to voluptuosity).
Voluptuosity transfigures the subject himself, who henceforth owes his
identity not to his initiative of power, but to the passivity of the love
received. He is passion and trouble, constant initiation into a mystery
rather than initiative. Eras can not be interpreted as a superstructure
having the individual as basis and subject. The subject in voluptuosity
finds himself again as the self ( which does not mean the object or the
theme) of an other, and not only as the self of himself. The relationship
with the carnal and the tender precisely makes this self arise incessantly:
the subject's trouble is not assumed by his mastery as a subject, but
is his being moved [attendrissement], his eflemination, which the heroic
and virile I will remember as one of those things that stand apart from
"serious things." There is in the erotic relationship a characteristic
reversal of the subjectivity issued from position, a reversion of the
virile and heroic I which in positing itself put an end to the anonymity
of the there is, and determined a mode of existence that opens forth
the light. In it plays the play of the possibilities of the I, and in this
play origin is produced in being in the guise of the I. Being is here
produced not as the definitiveness of a totality but as an incessant
recommencement, and consequently as infinite. But in the subject the
production of origin is the production of old age and death, which mock
power. The I returns to itself, finds itself again the same despite all its
recommencements, falls back on its feet again solitary, delineates but an
irreversible fate. Self-possession becomes encumberment with oneself.
270
D. The Subjectivity in Eros                      271
The subject is imposed upon itself, drags itself along like a possession.
The freedom of the subject that posits itself is not like the freedom of a
being free as the wind. It implies responsibility-which should surprise,
nothing being more opposed to freedom than the non-freedom of respon-
sibility. The coinciding of freedom with responsibility constitutes the I,
doubled with itself, encumbered with itself.
Eros delivers from this encumberment, arrests the return of the I to
itself. If the I does not here disappear by uniting with the Other, it does
not produce a work either, be it a work perfect as that of Pygmalion but
dead, leaving the I alone in the old age it finds at the end of its
adventure. Eros does not only extend the thoughts of a subject beyond
objects and faces; it goes toward a future which is not yet and which I
will not merely grasp, but I will be-it no longer has the structure
of the subject which from every adventure returns to its island, like
Ulysses. The I springs forth without returning, finds itself the self of an
other: its pleasure, its pain is pleasure over the pleasure of the other or
over his pain-though not through sympathy or compassion. Its future
does not fall back upon the past it ought to renew; it remains an absolute
future by virtue of this subjectivity which consists not in bearing repre-
sentations or powers but in transcending absolutely in fecundity. The
"transcendence of fecundity" does not have the structure of intentional-
ity, does not reside in the powers of the I, for the alterity of the femi.i
nine is associated with it: the erotic subjectivity is constituted in the com-
mon act of the sensing and the sensed as the self of an other, and
accordingly is constituted within a relation with the other, within a
relation with the face. In this community there plays an equivocation, to
be sure: the other presents himself as lived by myself, as object of my
enjoyment. This is why, as we have already said, erotic love oscillates
between being beyond desire and being beneath need, and why its enjoy-
ment takes its place among all the other pleasures and joys of life. But in
addition it takes place beyond all pleasure, all power, beyond all war
with the freedom of the other, for the amorous subjectivity is transub-
stantiation itself. This unparalleled relation between two substances,
where a beyond substances is exhibited, is resolved in paternity. The "be-
yond substances" is not open to a power, such as to confirm the I,
but neither is it produced in the being of the impersonal, the neuter, the
anonymous-infra-personal or supra-personal. This future still refers
to the personal from which it is nonetheless liberated: it is the child,
mine in a certain sense or, more exactly, me, but not myself; it does not
272                        Totality and Infinity
fall back upon my past to fuse with it and delineate a fate. In fecundity
subjectivity no longer has the same meaning. Like need, eros is bound up
with a subject identical with himself, in the logical sense. But the in-
evitable reference of the erotic. to the future in fecundity reveals a radi-
cally different structure: the subject is not only all that he will do, he
does not maintain with alterity the relationship of thought, possessing the
other as a theme, he does not have the structure of speech that calls upon
the Other; he will he other than himself while remaining himself, hut
not across a residue common to the former and the new avatar. This
alteration and identification in fecundity-beyond the possible and the
face--constitutes paternity. In paternity desire maintained as insatiate
desire, that is, as goodness, is accomplished. It can not he accomplished
by being satisfied. For Desire to be accomplished is equivalent to
engendering good being, to being goodness of goodness.
The structure of the subjectivity's identity that is produced in Eros
takes us outside the categories of classical logic. To he sure, the I,
identity par excellence, has often been caught sight of on the margin of
identity, an I profiling itself behind the I ; thought hearkens to itself.
Muse, genius, Socrates' daemon, Faust's Mephistopheles speak in the
depths of the I and guide it. Or else the freedom of absolute commence-
ment turns out to he obedience to insidious forms of the impersonal and
the neuter: Hegel's universal, Durkheim's social, the statistical laws
that govern our freedom, Freud's unconscious, the existential that sus-
tains the existentiel in Heidegger. All these notions represent not an
opposition between diverse faculties of the I, hut the presence behind the
I of a foreign principle which is not necessarily opposed to the I, hut
which can assume this enemy demeanor. To these inftuences stands
opposed M. Teste, who wishes to be nothing but myself, at the absolute
origin of all these initiatives, without there being any personality or
entity behind him prompting his actions. If our exposition must intro-
duce a notion of subject distinct from this absolute I of M. Teste, it docs
not lead to the affirmation of an I behind the I, unknown to the conscious
I, and fettering it anew. It is precisely as itself that the I is, in the
relation with the Other in femininity, liberated of its identity, that it can
be other on the basis of self as origin. In the I being can be produced as
infinitely recommencing, that is, properly speaking, as infinite.
The notion of fecundity does not refer to the wholly objective idea of
the species to which the I comes as an accident. Or else, if one prefers,
the unity of the species is deduced from the desire of the I which does not
D. The Subjectivity in Eros                     273
renounce the event of origin in which its being is effected. Fecundity is
part of the very drama of the I. The intersubjective reached across the
notion of fecundity opens up a plane where the I is divested of its tragic
egoity, which turns back to itself, and yet is not purely and simply dis-
solved into the collective. Fecundity evinces a unity that is not opposed
to multiplicity, but, in the precise sense of the term, engenders it.
## E. Transcendence
## And Fecundity


As classically conceived, the idea of transcendence is self-contradic-
tory. The subject that transcends is swept away in its transcendence; it
does not transcend itself. If, instead of reducing itself to a change of
properties, climate, or level, transcendence would commit the very iden-
tity of the subject, we would witness the death of its substance.
It may, certainly, be asked whether death is not transcendence itself;
whether among the elements of this world-simple avatars-where
change only transforms, that is, safeguards and presupposes a permanent
term, death does not represent the exceptional event of a transubstan-
tiation coming to pass, which, without returning to nothingness, ensures
its continuity otherwise than by the subsistence of an identical term. But
that would be tantamount to defining the "problematic concept" of
transcendence. It would shake the foundations of our logic.
For our logic rests on the indissoluble bond between the One and
Being, a bond that is incumbent on reflection because we always envisage
existing in an existant. Being qua being is for us monadic. Pluralism
appears in Western philosophy only as a plurality of subjects that exist.
Never has it appeared in the existing of those existants. The plural,
exterior to the existence of beings, is given as a number; to a subject
that counts it is already subordinated to the synthesis of the "I think."
Unity alone is ontologically privileged. Throughout Western metaphys-
ics quantity is scorned as a superficial category. Whence transcendence
itself will never be profound; as a "simple relation," it is situated
outside of the event of being. Consciousness appears as the very type
of existing in which the multiple is and yet, in synthesis, is no more, in
which, consequently, transcendence, a simple relation, is less than being.
The object is converted into an event of the subject. Light, the element
of knowledge, makes all that we encounter be ours. When knowledge
takes on an ecstatic signification, when, for Leon Brunschvicg, the spirit-
274
E. Transcendence and Fecundity                      275
ual I posits itself in refusing itself, affirms generously its personality in
negating its egoism, it issues in Spinozist unity, relative to which the I is
but a thought. And the alleged movement of transcendence is reduced
to a return from an imaginary exile.
In articulating existing as time rather than congealing it in the
permanence of the stable the philosophy of becoming seeks to disengage
itself from the category of the one, which compromises transcendence.
The upsurge or the projection of the future transcends-not by knowl-
edge only, but by the very existing of being. Existing is freed from
the unity of the existant. To substitute Becoming for Being is above all
to envisage being outside of the existent. Interpenetration of instants in
duration, openness upon the future, "being for death": these are ways
of expressing an existing not in conformity with the logic of unity.
This separation of Being and the One is obtained by the rehabilitation
of the possible. No longer backed up behind the unity of the Aristo-
telian act, possibility harbors the very multiplicity of its dynamism,
hitherto indigent alongside of the act accomplished, henceforth richer
than it. But the possible is immediately inverted into Power and
Domination. In the new that springs from it the subject recognizes
himself. He finds himself again in it, masters it. His freedom writes his
history which is one; his projects delineate a fate of which he is master
and slave. An existant remains the principle of the transcendence of
power. A man thirsting for power, aspiring to its divinization, and
consequently destined to solitude, appears at the term of this transcend-
ence.
There is in Heidegger's "late philosophy" an impossibility for power
to maintain itself as monarchy, to ensure its total mastery. The light of
comprehension and truth streams into the darkness of incomprehension
and non-truth; power, bound to mystery, avows its impotence. Thereby
the unity of the existant seems broken, and fate, as errance, once more
mocks the being that in comprehension means to govern it. What is
the import of this admission? To say, as M. De Waelhens has tried
to affirm in the Introduction to De I'essence de la verite! that errance is
not known as such, but experienced, is perhaps to play with words. In
Heidegger the human being apprehended as power remains, in reality,
truth and light. Heidegger hence disposes of no notion to describe the

• Martin Heidegger, De ['essence de la 'lllritl, Fr. trans. of Fom Wesen der
Wahrheit Alphonse De Waehlens (Louvain, 1950).
276                         Totality and Infinity
relation with mystery, already implied in the 6nitude of Dasein. If
power is at the same time impotence, it is by reference to power that this
impotence is described.
We have sought outside of consciousness and power for a notion of
being founding transcendence. The acuity of the problem lies in the
necessity of maintaining the I in the transcendence with which it hitherto
seemed incompatible. Is the subject only a subject of knowings and
powers? Does it not present itself as a subject in another sense? The
relation sought, which qua subject it supports, and which at the same
time satis6es these contradictory exigencies, seemed to us to be inscribed
in the erotic relation.
One might doubt that there is a new ontological principle here. Does
not the social relation resolve itself entirely into relations of consciousness
and powers? As a collective representation it would in fact differ from a
thought only by its content, and not by its formal structure.
Participation presupposes the fundamental relations of the logic of ob-
jects, and even in Uvy-Bruhl it is treated as a psychological curiosity.
It masks the absolute originality of the erotic relation which is, disdain-
fully, relegated to the biological.
Yet, curiously enough, the philosophy of the biological itself, when it
goes beyond mechanism, falls back on 6nalism and a dialectic of the
whole and the part. That the vital impulse propagates itself across the
separation of individuals, that its trajectory is discontinuous, that is, that
it presupposes the intervals of sexuality and a speci6c dualism in its
articulation, is not seriously taken into consideration. When, with
Freud, sexuality is approached on the human plane, it is reduced to the
level of the search for pleasure, without the ontological signi6cation of
voluptuosity and the irreducible categories it brings into play ever being
even suspected. One gives oneself pleasure ready made; one reasons
on the basis of it. What remains unrecognized is that the erotic, ana-
lysed as fecundity, breaks up reality into relations irreducible to the
relations of genus and species, part and whole, action and passion, truth
and error; that in sexuality the subject enters into relation with what is
absolutely other, with an alterity of a type unforeseeable in formal logic,
with what remains other in the relation and is never converted into
"mine," and that nonetheless this relation has nothing ecstatic about it,
for the pathos of voluptuosity is made of duality.
Neither knowledge nor power. In voluptuosity the Other, the femi-
nine, withdraws into its mystery. The relation with it is a relation
E. Transcendence and Fecundity                      277
with its absence, an absence on the plane of knowledge-the unknown
-but a presence in voluptuosity. Nor power: there is no initiative at
the birth of love, which arises in the passivity of its pangs. Sexuality is
in us neither knowledge nor power, but the very plurality of our existing.
For it is as characteristics of the very ipseity of the I, the very
subjectivity of the subject, that the erotic relation is to be analysed.
Fecundity is to be set up as an ontological category. In a situation
such as paternity the return of the I to the self, which is set forth in the
monist concept of the identical subject, is found to be completely modi-
fied. The son is not only my work, like a poem or an object, nor is he
my property. Neither the categories of power nor those of knowledge
describe my relation with the child. The fecundity of the I is neither a
cause nor a domination. I do not have my child; I am my child.
Paternity is a relation with a stranger who while being Other ( "And
you shall say to yourself, 'who can have borne me these? I was bereaved
and barren .. .'" Isaiah, 49) is me, a relation of the I with a self
which yet is not me. In this "I am" being is no longer Eleatic unity. In
existing itself there is a multiplicity and a transcendence. In this
transcendence the I is not swept away, since the son is not me ; and yet I
am my son. The fecundity of the I is its very transc~ndence. The
biological origin of this concept nowise neutralizes the paradox of its
meaning, and delineates a structure that goes beyond the biologically
empirical.
## F. Filiality And Fraternity


The I breaks free from itself in paternity without thereby ceasing to
be an I, for the I is its son.
The converse of paternity, filiality, the father-son relationship, desig-
nates a relation of rupture and a recourse at the same time.
As rupture, repudiation of the father, commencement, filiality at each
moment accomplishes and repeats the paradox of a created freedom. But
in this apparent contradiction and in the form of the son being is
infinitely and discontinuously, historical without fate. The past is recap-
tured at each moment from a new point, from a novelty that no
continuity, such as that which still weighs on the Bergsonian duration,
could compromise. For in continuity, where being bears the whole
burden of the past ( even if in its projection unto the future it should, in
defiance of death, recommence), the past limits the infinitude of being,
and this limitation is manifested in its senescence.
The recapture of this past can be produced as a recourse. For by
existing an existence which still subsists in the father the I echos the
transcendence of the paternal I who is his child: the son is, without being
"on his own account"; he shifts the charges of his being on the other and
thus plays his being. Such a mode of existence is produced as childhood,
with its essential reference to the protective existence of the parents.
The notion of maternity must be introduced here to account for this
recourse. But this recourse to the past, with which the son has nonethe-
less in his ipseity broken, defines a notion distinct from continuity, a way
of resuming the thread of history-concrete in a family and in a nation.
The originality of this resumption [renouement], distinct from continu-
ity, is attested in the revolt or the permanent revolution that constitutes
ipseity.
But the son's relation with the father across fecundity is not effected
only in recourse and the rupture which the I of the son accomplishes as
an I already existing. The I owes its unicity as an I to the paternal
Eros. The father does not simply cause the son. To be one's son means
278
F. Filiality and Fraternity                      279
to be I in one's son, to be substantially in him, yet without being main-
tained there in identity. Our whole analysis of fecundity aimed to
establish this dialectical conjuncture, which conserves the two contradic-
tory movements. The son resumes the unicity of the father and yet
remains exterior to the father : the son is a unique son. Not by number;
each son of the father is the unique son, the chosen son. The love of the
father for the son accomplishes the sole relation possible with the very
unicity of another; and in this sense every love must approach paternal
love. But this relation of the father with the son is not added to the
already constituted I of the son, as a good fortune, The paternal Eros
first invests the unicity of the son; his I qua filial commences not in
enjoyment but in election. He is unique for himself because he is unique
for his father. This is precisely why he can, as a child, not exist "on his
own." And because the son owes his unicity to the paternal election he
can be brought up, be commanded, and can obey, and the strange
con juncture of the family is possible. Creation contradicts the freedom
of the creature only when creation is confused with causality. Whereas
creation as a relation of transcendence, of union and fecundity, condi-
tions the positing of a unique being, and his ipseity qua elected.
But the I liberated from its very identity in its fecundity cannot
maintain its separation with regard to this future if it is bound to its
future in its unique child. The unique child, as elected one, is accord-
ingly at the same time unique and non-unique. Paternity is produced as
an innumerable future; the I engendered exists at the same time as unique
in the world and as brother among brothers. I am I and chosen one, but
where can I be chosen, if not from among other chosen ones, among
equals? The I as I hence remains turned ethically to the face of the
other: fraternity is the very relation with the face in which at the same
time my election and equality, that is, the mastery exercised over me by
the other, are accomplished. The election of the I, its very ipseity, is
revealed to be a privilege and a subordination, because it does not place it
among the other chosen ones, but rather in face of them, to serve them,
and because no one can be substituted for the I to measure the extent of
its responsibilities.
If biology furnishes us the prototypes of all these relations, this proves,
to be sure, that biology does not represent a purely contingent order of
being, unrelated to its essential production. But these relations free
themselves from their biological limitation. The human I is posited in
fraternity: that all men are brothers is not added to man as a moral
280                        Totality and Infinity
conquest, but constitutes his ipseity. Because my position as an I is
effectuated already in fraternity the face can present itself to me as a
face. The relation with the face in fraternity, where in his turn the
Other appears in solidarity with all the others, constitutes the social
order, the reference of every dialogue to the third party by which the We
-or the parti--encompasses the face to face opposition, opens the erotic
upon a social life, all signifyingness and decency, which encompasses the
structure of the family itself. But the erotic and the family which
articulates it ensure to this life, in which the I does not disappear but is
promised and called to goodness, the infinite time of triumph without
which goodness would be subjectivity and folly.
## G. The Infinity Of Time


To be infinitely-in6nition-means to exist without limits, and thus
in the form of an origin, a commencement, that is, again, as an existent.
The absolute indetermination of the there is, an existing without exis-
tants, is an incessant negation, to an infinite degree, consequently an infi-
nite limitation. Against the anarchy of the there is the existent is pro-
duced, a subject of what can happen, an origin and commencement, a
power. Unless the origin had its identity of itself infinition would not be
possible. But infinition is produced by the existent that is not trammeled
in being, that can, while remaining bound to being, take its distances
with regard to being: infinition is produced by the existent that exists
in truth. Distance with regard to being, by which the existent exists
in truth ( or ad infinitum), is produced as time and as consciousness, or
again, as anticipation of the possible. Across this distance of time the
definitive is not definitive ; being, while being, is not yet, remains in
suspense, and can at each instant commence. The structure of con-
sciousness or of temporality--o.f distance and truth-results from an
elementary gesture of the being that refuses totalization. This refusal
is produced as a relation with the non-encompassable, as the welcom-
ing of alterity--<oncretely, as presentation of the face. The face
arrests totalization. The welcoming of alterity hence conditions con-
sciousness and time. Death does not compromise the power by which
infinition as a negation of being and as nothingness is produced; it
menaces power by suppressing distance. Infinition by way of power is
limited in the return of power to the subject from which it emanates, and
which it ages by forming the definitive. The time in which being ad
infinitum is produced goes beyond the possible. In fecundity distance
with regard to being is not only provided in the real; it consists in a
distance with regard to the present itself, which chooses its possibles, but
is realized and has aged somewhat, and consequently, congealed into
definitive reality, has already sacrificed possibles. Memories, seeking
after lost time, procure dreams, but do not restore the lost occasions.
281
282                        Totality and Infinity
Thus true temporality, that in which the definitive is not definitive,
presupposes the possibility not of grasping again all that one might have
been, but of no longer regretting the lost occasions before the unlimited
infinity of the future. It is not a question of complacency in some
romanticism of the possibles, but of escaping the crushing responsibility
of existence that veers into fate, of resuming the adventure of existence so
as to be to the infinite. The I is at the same time this engagement and
this disengagement-and in this sense time, drama in several acts.
Without multiplicity and discontinuity-without fecundity-the I
would remain a subject in which every adventure would revert into the
adventure of a fate. A being capable of another fate than its own is a
fecund being. In paternity, where the I, across the definitiveness of an
inevitable death, prolongs itself in the other, time triumphs over old
age and fate by its discontinuity. Paternity-the way of being other
while being oneself-has nothing in common with a transformation in
time which could not surmount the identity of what traverses it, nor
with some metempsychosis in which the I can know only an avatar, and
not be another I. This discontinuity must be emphasized.
The very permanence of the I in the lightest, the least sedentary,
the most graceful being, the being most launched toward the future,
produces the irreparable, and consequently limits. The irreparable is
not due to the fact that we conserve a memory of each instant; on the con-
trary, memory is founded on this incorruptibility of the past, on the re-
turn of the I to itself. But does not the memory arisen in each new
instant already give to the past· a new meaning? In this sense, better
than clinging to the past, does it not already repair it? For in this
return of the new instant to the former instant lies the salutary character
of succession. But this return weighs upon the present instant, "laden
with all the past," even if it is pregnant with the whole future. Its age
limits its powers and opens it to the imminence of death.
The discontinuous time of fecundity makes possible an absolute youth
and recommencement, while leaving the recommencement a relation
with the recommenced past in a free return to that past ( free with a
freedom other than that of memory), and in free interpretation and free
choice, in an existence as entirely pardoned. This recommencement of
the instant, this triumph of the time of fecundity over the becoming of
the mortal and aging being, is a pardon, the very work of time.
Pardon in its immediate sense is connected with the moral phenome-
G. The Infinity of Time                        283
non of fault. The paradox of pardon lies in its retroaction; from the
point of view of common time it represents an inversion of the natural
order of things, the reversibility of time. It involves several aspects.
Pardon refers to the instant elapsed; it permits the subject who had
committed himself in a past instant to be as though that instant had not
past on, to be as though he had not committed himself. Active in a
stronger sense than forgetting, which does not concern the reality of
the event forgotten, pardon acts upon the past, somehow repeats the
event, purifying it. But in addition, forgetting nullifies the relations
with the past, whereas pardon conserves the past pardoned in the purified
present. The pardoned being is not the innocent being. The difference
does not justify placing innocence above pardon; it permits the discerning
in pardon of a surplus of happiness, the strange happiness of reconcilia-
tion, the / elix culpa, given in an everyday experience which no longer
astonishes us.
The paradox of the pardon of fault refers to pardon as constitutive of
time itself. The instants do not link up with one another indifferently,
but extend from the Other unto me. The future does not come to me
from a swarming of indistinguishable possibles which would flow toward
my present and which I would grasp; it comes to me across an absolute
interval whose other shore the Other absolutely other-though he be my
son-is alone capable of marking, and of connecting with the past. But
then the Other is alone capable of retaining from this past the former De-
sire that animated it, which the alterity of each face increases and deepens
ever more profoundly. If time does not make moments of mathematical
time, indifferent to one another, succeed one another, it does not accom-
plish Bergson's continuous duration either. The Bergsonian conception
of time explains why it is necessary to wait "for the sugar to melt": time
no longer expresses the unintelligible dispersion of the unity of being,
wholly contained in the first cause, in an apparent and phantasmal series
of causes and effects ; time adds something new to being, something
absolutely new. But the newness of springtimes that flower in the in-
stant ( which, in good logic, is like the prior one) is already heavy with
all the springtimes lived through. The profound work of time delivers
from this past, in a subject that breaks with his father. Time is the
non-definitiveness of the definitive, an ever recommencing alterity of the
accomplished-the "ever" of this recommencement. The work of time
goes beyond the suspension of the definitive which the continuity of
284                        Totality and Infinity
duration makes possible. There must be a rupture of continuity, and
continuation across this rupture. The essential in time consists in being
a drama, a multiplicity of acts where the following act resolves the prior
one. Being is no longer produced at one blow, irremissibly present.
Reality is what it is, but will be once again, another time freely resumed
and pardoned. Infinite being is produced as times, that is, in several
times across the dead time that separates the father from the son. It is
not the finitude of being that constitutes the essence of time, as Heideg-
ger thinks, but its infinity. The death sentence does not approach as an
end of being, but as an unknown, which as such suspends power. The
constitution of the interval that liberates being from the limitation of
fate calls for death. The nothingness of the interval-a dead time-is
the production of infinity. Resurrection constitutes the principal event
of time. There is therefore no continuity in being. Time is discontin-
uous; one instant does not come out of another without interruption, by
an ecstasy. In continuation the instant meets its death, and resuscitates;
death and resurrection constitute time. But such a formal structure
presupposes the relation of the I with the Other and, at its basis,
fecundity across the discontinuous which constitutes time.
The psychological fact of the felix culpa-the surplus reconciliation
provides by reason of the rupture it integrates--refers therefore to all the
mystery of time. The fact and the justification of time consist in the
recommencement it makes possible in the resurrection, across fecundity,
of all the compossibles sacrificed in the present.
Why is the beyond separated from the below? Why, to go unto
the good, are evil, evolution, drama, separation necessary? Recom-
mencement in discontinuous time brings youth, and thus the infini-
tion of time. Time's infinite existing ensures the situation of judgment,
condition of truth, behind the failure of the goodness of today. By
fecundity I dispose of an infinite time, necessary for truth to be told,
necessary for the particularism of the apology to be converted into
efficacious goodness, which maintains the I of the apology in its particu-
larity, without history breaking and crushing this allegedly still subjective
concordance.
But infinite time is also the putting back into question of the truth it
promises. The dream of a happy eternity, which subsists in man along
with his happiness, is not a simple aberration. Truth requires both an
infinite time and a time it will be able to seal, a completed time. The
G. The Infinity of Time                        285
completion of time is not death, but messianic time, where the perpetual
is converted into eternal. Messianic triumph is the pure triumph; it is
secured against the revenge of evil whose return the infinite time does not
prohibit. Is this eternity a new structure of time, or an extreme vigi-
lance of the messianic consciousness? The problem exceeds the bounds
of this book.
CONCLUSIONS
1. From the Like to the Same
This work has not sought to describe the psychology of the social
relation, beneath which the eternal play of the fundamental categories
reflected definitively in formal logic would be maintained. On the
contrary the social relation, the idea of infinity, the presence in a con-
tainer of a content exceeding its capacity, was described in this book as
the logical plot of being. The specification of a concept the moment it
issues in its individuation is not produced by adjunction of an ultimate
specific difference, not even if it originates in matter. The individual-
ities thus obtained within the ultimate species would be indiscernible.
The Hegelian dialectic is all powerful to reduce this individuality of the
rbf>E rL to the concept, since the act of pointing to a here and a now
implies references to the situation, in which the finger's movement is
identified from the outside. The identity of the individual does not
consist in being like to itself, and in letting itself be identified from the
outside by the finger that points to it; it consists in being the same-in
being oneself, in identifying oneself from within. There exists a logical
passage from the like to the same; singularity logically arises from the
logical sphere exposed to the gaze and organized into a totality by the
reversion of this sphere into the interiority of the I, the reversion, so to
speak, of convexity into concavity. And the entire analysis of interiority
pursued in this work describes the conditions of this reversion. Relations
such as the idea of infinity, which the formal logic of the gaze cannot let
show through without absurdity, and which it prompts us to interpret in
theological or psychological terms ( as a miracle or as an illusion), have a
place in the logic of interiority-in a sort of micro-logic-in which
289
290                        Totality and Infinity
logic is pursued beyond the TOOE Tl. Social relations do not simply
present us with a superior empirical matter, to be treated in terms of
the logic of genus and species. They are the original deployment of the
relationship that is no longer open to the gaze that would encompass
its terms, but is accomplished from me to the other in the face to face.


2. Being Is Exteriority
Being is exteriority. This formula does not only mean to denounce
the illusions of the subjective, and claim that objective forms alone, in
opposition to the sands in which arbitrary thought is mired and lost,
merit the name of being. Such a conception would in the end destroy
exteriority, since subjectivity itself would be absorbed into exteriority,
revealing itself to be a moment of a panoramic play. Exteriority would
then no longer mean anything, since it would encompass the very interi-
ority that justified this appellation.
But exteriority is not yet maintained if we affirm a subject insoluble
into objectivity, and to which exteriority would be opposed. This time
exteriority would acquire a relative meaning, as the great by relation to
the small. But in the absolute the subject and the object would still
be parts of the same system, would be enacted and revealed panoram-
ically. Exteriority, or, if one prefers, alterity, would be converted into
the same. And over and beyond the relation between the interior and
the exterior there would be room for the perception of this relation by a
lateral view that would take in and perceive (or penetrate) their play, or
would provide an ultimate stage on which this relation would be enacted,
on which its being would be effected truly.
Being is exteriority: the very exercise of its being consists in exterior-
ity, and no thought could better obey being than by allowing itself to
be dominated by this exteriority. Exteriority is true not in a lateral
view apperceiving it in its opposition to interiority; it is true in a face to
face that is no longer entirely vision, but goes further than vision. The
face to face is established starting with a point separated from exteriority
so radically that it maintains itself of itself, is me; every other relation
that would not part from this separated and therefore arbitrary point
(but whose arbitrariness and separation are produced in a positive mode
as me), would miss the--necessarily subjective--field of truth. The true
essence of man is presented in his face, in which he is infinitely other than
Conclusions                                291
a violence like unto mine, opposed to mine and hostile, already at grips
with mine in a historical world where we participate in the same system.
He arrests and paralyzes my violence by his call, which does not do
violence, and comes from on high. The truth of being is not the image
of being, the idea of its nature; it is the being situated in a subjective field
which deforms vision, but precisely thus allows exteriority to state itself,
entirely command and authority: entirely superiority. This curvature of
the intersubjective space inflects distance into elevation; it does not
falsify being, but makes its truth first possible.
One cannot "allow for" this refraction "produced" by the subjective
field, so as to thus "correct" it; it constitutes the very mode in which the
exteriority of being is effectuated- in its truth. The impossibility of
"total reflection" is not due to a flaw in subjectivity. The so-called
"objective" nature of the entities that would appear outside of this
"curvature of space"-the phenomenon-would, on the contrary, indi-
cate the loss of metaphysical truth, the superior truth-in the literal
sense of the term. This "curvature" of the intersubjective space in
which exteriority is effectuated (we do not say "in which it appears") as
superiority must be distinguished from the arbitrariness of "points of
view" taken upon objects that appear. But the latter, source of errors
and opinions, issued from the violence opposed to exteriority, is the price
of the former.
This "curvature of space" expresses the relation between human
beings. That the Other is placed higher than me would be a pure and
simple error if the welcome I make him consisted in "perceiving" a
nature. Sociology, psychology, physiology are thus deaf to exteriority.
Man as Other comes to us from the outside, a separated--or holy-face.
His exteriority, that is, his appeal to me, is his truth. My response is not
added as an accident to a "nucleus" of his objectivity, but first produces
his truth ( which his "point of view" upon me can not nullify). This
surplus of truth over being and over its idea, which we suggest by the
metaphor of the "curvature of intersubjective space," signifies the divine
intention of all truth. This "curvature of space" is, perhaps, the very
presence of God.
The face to face is a final and irreducible relation which no concept
could cover without the thinker who thinks that concept finding himself
forthwith before a new interlocutor; it makes possible the pluralism of
society.
292                        Totality and Infinity

3. The Finite and the Infinite
Exteriority, taken as the essence of being, signifies the resistance of the
social multiplicity to the logic that totalizes the multiple. For this logic,
multiplicity is a fall of the One or the Infinite, a diminution in being
which each of the multiple beings would have to surmount so as to return
from the multiple to the One, from the finite to the Infinite.
Metaphysics, the relation with exteriority, that is, with superiority,
indicates, on the contrary, that the relation between the finite and the in-
finite does not consist in the finite being absorbed in what faces him, but
in remaining in his own being, maintaining himself there, acting here
below. The austere happiness of goodness would invert its meaning
and would be perverted if it confounded us with God. In understand-
ing being as exteriority, in breaking with the panoramic existing of being
and the totality in which it is produced, we can understand the meaning
of the finite without its limitation, occurring within the infinite, requiring
an incomprehensible fall of the infinite, without finitude consisting in a
nostalgia for infinity, a longing for return. To posit being as exterior-
ity is to apperceive infinity as the Desire for infinity, and thus to
understand that the production of infinity calls for separation, the pro-
duction of the absolute arbitrariness of the I or of the origin.
The traits of limitation and finitude, which separation takes on, do not
sanction a simple "less," intelligible on the basis of the "infinitely more"
and the unfailing plenitude of infinity; they ensure the very overflowing
of infinity, or, to speak concretely, the very overflowing of all the surplus
over being-all the Good-that is produced in the social relation. The
negativeness of the finite is to be understood on the basis of this Good.
The social relation engenders this surplus of the Good over being,
multiplicity over the One. It does not consist in reconstituting the
wholeness of the perfect being which Aristophanes speaks of in the myth
of the Symposium, nor in being immersed again in the whole and
abdicating into the intemporal, nor in gaining the whole through history.
The adventure separation opens is absolutely new with regard to the
beatitude of the One and its famous freedom, which consists in negating
or in absorbing the other, so as to encounter nothing. The concept of a
Good beyond Being and beyond the beatitude of the One announces a
rigorous concept of creation, which would be neither a negation nor a
limitation nor an emanation of the One. Exteriority is not a negation,
but a marvel.
Conclusions                              293

4. Creation
Theology imprudently treats the idea of the relation between God
and the creature in terms of ontology. It presupposes the logical privi-
lege of totality, as a concept adequate to being. Thus it runs up against
the difficulty of understanding that an infinite being would border on or
tolerate something outside of itself, or that a free being would send
its roots into the infinity of a God. But transcendence precisely refuses
totality, does not lend itself to a view that would encompass it from the
outside. Every "comprehension" of transcendence leaves the transcend-
ent outside, and is enacted before its face. If the notions of totality and
being are notions that cover one another, the notion of the transcend-
ent places us beyond categories of being. We thus encounter, in our own
way, the Platonic idea of the Good beyond Being. The transcendent is
what can not he encompassed. This is an essential precision of the notion
of transcendence, utilizing no theological notion. What embarrasses the
traditional theology, which treats of creation in terms of ontology-God
leaving his eternity, in order to create--is incumbent as a first truth in a
philosophy that begins with transcendence: nothing could better distin-
guish totality and separation than the difierence between eternity and
time. But then the Other, in his signification prior to my initiative,
resembles God. This signification precedes my Sinngebung initiative.
For the idea of totality, in which ontological philosophy veritably
reunites-or comprehends-the multiple, must be substituted the idea of
a separation resistant to synthesis. To affirm origin from nothing by
creation is to contest the prior community of all thing within eternity,
from which philosophical thought, guided by ontology, makes things arise
as from a common matrix. The absolute gap of separation which
transcendence implies could not be better expressed than by the term
creation, in which the kinship of beings among themselves is affirmed, but
at the same time their radical heterogeneity also, their reciprocal exterior-
ity coming from nothingness. One may speak of creation to characterize
entities situated in the transcendence that does not close over into a
totality. In the face to face the I has neither the privileged position of
the subject nor the position of the thing defined by its place in the
system; it is apology, discourse pro domo, but discourse of justification
before the Other. The Other is the prime intelligible, since he is capable
of justifying my freedom, rather than awaiting a Sinngebung or a
meaning from it. In the conjuncture of creation the I is for itself,
294                        Totality and Infinity
without being causa sui. The will of the I affirms itself as infinite ( that
is, free), and as limited, as subordinated. It does not get its limits from
the proximity of the other, who, being transcendent, does not define it.
The I's form no totality; there exists no privileged plane where these I's
could be grasped in their principle. There is an anarchy essential to
multiplicity. In the absence of a plane common to the totality (which
one persists in seeking, so as to relate the multiplicity to it) one will
never know which will, in the free play of the wills, pulls the strings
of the game; one will not know who is playing with whom. But a
principle breaks through all this trembling and vertigo when the face
presents itself, and demands justice.


5. Exteriority and Language
We have begun with the resistance of beings to totalization, with an
untotaled multiplicity they constitute, the impossibility of their concilia-
tion in the same.
This impossibility of conciliation among beings, this radical hetero-
geneity, in fact indicates a mode of being produced and an ontology that
is not equivalent to panoramic existence and its disclosure. For
common sense but also for philosophy, from Plato to Heidegger, pano-
ramic existence and its disclosure are equivalent to the very production of
being, since truth or disclosure is at the same time the work or the
essential virtue of being, the Sein of the Seiendes and of every human
behavior it would in the last analysis govern. The Heideggerian thesis
that every human attitude consists in "bringing to light" (modern
technology itself would be but a mode of extracting things or producing
them in the sense of "fully bringing to light") rests on this primacy of
the panoramic. The break-up of totality, the denunciation of the pano-
ramic structure of being, concerns the very existing of being and not the
collocation or configuration of ent1t1es refractory to system.
Correlatively, the analysis that tends to show intentionality as an aiming
at the visible, at the idea, expresses this domination of the panoramic as
the ultimate virtue of being, the Being of the existent. This trait is
maintained in the modern analysis of affectivity, practice, and existence,
despite all the suppleness forced upon the notion of contemplation. One
of the principal theses of this work is that the noesis-noema structure is
not the primordial structure of intentionality ( which is not equivalent to
interpreting intentionality as a logical relation or as causality).
Conclusions                              29S
The exteriority of being does not, in fact, mean that multiplicity is
without relation. However, the relation that binds this multiplicity does
not fill the abyss of separation; it confirms it. In this relation we have
recognized language, produced only in the face to face; and in language
we have recognized teaching. Teaching is a way for truth to be pro-
duced such that it is not my work, such that I could not derive it from
my own interiority. In affirming such a production of truth we modify
the original meaning of truth and the noesis-noema structure, taken as
the meaning of intentionality.
In effect, the being who speaks to me and to whom I respond or whom
I interrogate does not offer himself to me, does not give himself so that I
could assume this manifestation, measure it to my own interiority, and
receive it as come from myself. Vision operates in this manner, totally
impossible in discourse. For vision is essentially an adequation of exteri-
ority with interiority: in it exteriority is reabsorbed in the contemplative
soul and, as an adequate idea, revealed to be a priori, the result of a
Sinngebung. The exteriority of discourse cannot be converted into
interiority. The interlocutor can have no place in an inwardness; he is
forever outside. The relationship between separated beings does not
totalize them; it is a "unrelating relation," which no one can encom-
pass or thematize. Or more exactly, he who would think it, who
would totalize it, would by this "reflection" mark a new scission in being,
since he would still tell this total to someone. The relation between the
"fragments" of separated being is a face to face, the irreducible and
ultimate relation. An interlocutor arises again behind him whom
thought has just apprehended-as the certitude of the cogito arises behind
every negation of certitude. The description of the face to face which
we have attempted here is told to the other, to the reader who appears
anew behind my discourse and my wisdom. Philosophy is never a
wisdom, for the interlocutor whom it has just encompassed has already
escaped it. Philosophy, in an essentially liturgical sense, invokes the
Other to whom the "whole" is told, the master or student. It is
precisely for this that the face to face proper to discourse does not
connect a subject with an object, and differs from the essentially ade-
quate thematization. For no concept lays hold of exteriority.
The object thematized remains in itself, but it belongs to its essence to
be known by me; and the surplus of the in itself over my knowledge is
progressively absorbed by knowledge. The difference between the know-
ing that bears on the object and the knowing that bears on the in itself or
296                        Totality and Infinity
the solidity of the object dwindles in the course of a development of
thought which, according to Hegel, would be history itself. Objectivity
is absorbed in absolute knowledge, and the being of the thinker, the hu-
manity of man, is therewith conformed to the perpetuity of the solid in
itself, within a totality where the humanity of man and the exteriority
of the object are at the same time conserved and absorbed. Would the
transcendence of exteriority simply indicate an unfulfilled thought,
and would it be overcome in the totality? Would exteriority have to be
inverted into interiority? Is it evil?
We have broached the exteriority of being not as a form that being
would eventually or provisionally take on in dispersion or in its fall, but
as its very existing-inexhaustible, infinite exteriority. Such an exterior-
ity opens in the Other; it recedes from thematization. But it refuses
thematization positively because it is produced in a being who expresses
himself. In contradistinction to plastic manifestation or disclosure,
which manifests something as something, and in which the disclosed
renounces its originality, its hitherto unpublished existence, in expression
the manifestation and the manifested coincide; the manifested attends its
own manifestation and hence remains exterior to every image one would
retain of it, presents itself in the sense that we say of someone that he
presents himself by stating his name, which permits evoking him, even
though he remains always the source of his own presence. A presenta-
tion which consists in saying "It's me"*-and nothing else to which one
might be tempted to assimilate me. This presentation of the exterior
being nowise referred to in our world is what we have called the face.
And we have described the relation with the face that presents itself in
speech as desire-goodness and justice.
Speech refuses vision, because the speaker does not deliver images
of himself only, but is personally present in his speech, absolutely ex-
terior to every image he would leave. In language exteriority is exer-
cised, deployed, brought about. Whoever speaks attends his manifesta-
tion, is non-adequate to the meaning that the hearer would like to retain
of it as a result acquired outside of the very relationship of discourse, as
though this presence in speech were reducible to the Sinngebung of him
who listens. Language is the incessant surpassing of the Sinngebung by
the signification. This presence whose format exceeds the measure of the
I is not reabsorbed into my vision. The overflowing of exteriority, non-

• "moi, c'est moi."
Conclusions                             297
adequate to the vision which still measures it, precisely constitutes the
dimension of height or the divinity of exteriority. Divinity keeps its
distances. Discourse is discourse with God and not with equals, accord-
ing to the distinction established by Plato in the Phaedrus. Metaphysics
is the essence of this language with God; it leads above being.


6. Expression and Image
The presence of the Other, or expression, source of all signification, is
not contemplated as an intelligible essence, but is heard as language, and
thereby is effectuated exteriorly. Expression, or the face, overflows
images, which are always immanent to my thought, as though they came
from me. This overflowing, irreducible to an image of overflowing, is
produced commensurate with-or in the inordinateness of-Desire and
goodness, as the moral dissymmetry of the I and the other. The distance
of this exteriority immediately extends to height. The eye can conceive
it only by virtue of position which, as an above-below disposition, consti-
tutes the elementary fact of morality. Because it is the presence of
exteriority the face never becomes an image or an intuition. Every
intuition depends on a signification irreducible to intuition; it comes from
further than intuition, and it alone comes from afar. Signification,
irreducible to intuitions, is measured by Desire, morality, and goodness
-the infinite exigency with regard to oneself, or Desire of the other, or
relation with infinity.
The presence of the face, or expression, is not to be ranked among
other meaningful manifestations. The works of man all have meaning,
but the human being absents himself from them immediately, and is
divined across them; he too is given in the articulation of the "qas."
There is a abyss between labor, which results in works having a
meaning for other men, and which others can acquire-already mer-
chandise reflected in money-and language, in which I attend my mani-
festation, irreplaceable and vigilant. But this abyss gapes open because
of the en-ergy of the vigilant presence which does not quit the expression.
It is not to expression what the will is to its work; the will withdraws
from its work, delivering it over to its fate, and is found to have willed
"a lot of things" it had not willed. For the absurdity of these works is
not due to a defect of the thought that formed them; it is due to the
anonymity into which this thought immediately falls, to the unrecogni-
tion of the worker that results from this essential anonymity.
298                          Totality and Infinity
Jankelevitch is right to say that labor is not an expression.1 In acquiring
the work I desacralize the neighbor who produced it. Man is really
apart, non-encompassable, only in expression, where he can "bring aid"
to his own manifestation.
In political life, taken unrebuked, humanity is understood from its
works-a humanity of interchangeable men, of reciprocal relations.
The substitution of men for one another, the primal disrespect, makes
possible exploitation itself. In history-the history of States-the
human being appears as the sum of his works; even while he lives he
is his own heritage. Justice consists in again making possible expression,
in which in non-reciprocity the person presents himself as unique.
Justice is a right to speak. It is perhaps here that the perspective of a
religion opens. It diverges from political life, to which philosophy does
not lead necessarily.


7. Against the Philosophy of the Neuter
We have thus the conviction of having broken with the philosophy of
the Neuter: with the Heideggerian Being of the existent whose imper-
sonal neutrality the critical work of Blanchot has so much contributed to
bring out, with Hegel's impersonal reason, which shows to the personal
consciousness only its ruses. The movements of ideas of the philosophy
of the Neuter, so different in their origins and their influences, agree in
announcing the end of philosophy. For they exalt the obedience that no
face commands. Desire in the spell of the Neuter, said to have been
revealed to the Presocratics, or desire interpreted as need, and thus bound
to the essential violence of action, dismisses philosophy and is gratified
only in art or in politics. The exaltation of the Neuter may present itself
as the anteriority of the We with respect to the I, of the situation with
respect to the beings in situation. This book's insistance on the separa-
tion of enjoyment was guided by the necessity of liberating the I from the
situation into which little by little philosophers have dissolved it as
totally as reason swallows up the subject in Hegelian idealism.
Materialism does not lie in the discovery of the primordial function of
the sensibility, but in the primacy of the Neuter. To place the Neuter
dimension of Being above the existent which unbeknown to it this Being
would determine in some way, to make the essential events unbeknown to

1 V. Jankelevitch, L'Austirite et la '1ie morale   (Paris, 19S6), p. 34.
Conclusions                               299
the existents, is to profess materialism. Heidegger's late philosophy
becomes this faint materialism. It posits the revelation of Being
in human inhabitation between Heavens and Earth, in the expectation of
the gods and in the company of men, and sets up the landscape or the
"still life" as an origin of the human. The Being of the existent is a
Logos that is the word of no one. To begin with the face as a source
from which all meaning appears, the face in its absolute nudity, in its
destitution as a head that does not find a place to lay itself, is to affirm
that being is enacted in the relation between men, that Desire rather than
need commands acts. Desire, an aspiration that does not proceed from a
lack-metaphysics-is the desire of a person.


8. Subjectivity
Being is exteriority, and extenonty is produced in its truth in a
subjective field, for the separated being. Separation is accomplished
positively as the interiority of a being referring to itself and maintaining
itself of itself-all the way to atheism! This self-reference is concretely
constituted or accomplished as enjoyment or happiness. It is an essential
sufficiency, which in its expansion-in knowledge, whose ultimate essence
critique ( the recapturing of its own condition) develops-is even in
possession of its own origin.
To metaphysical thought, where a finite has the idea of infinity-
where radical separation and r~lationship with the other are produced
simultaneously-we have reserved the term intentionality, consciousness
of. . . . It is attention to speech or welcome of the face, hospitality and
not thematization. Self-consciousness is not a dialectical rejoinder of the
metaphysical consciousness that I have of the other. Nor is its relation
with itself a representation of itself. Prior to every vision of self it is
accomplished by holding oneself up [se tenant] ; it is implanted in itself as
a body and i!: keeps itself [se tient] in its interiority, in its home. It thus
accomplishes separation positively, without being reducible to a negation
of the being from which it separates. But thus precisely it can welcome
that being. The subject is a host.
Subjective existence derives its features from separation. Individua-
tion-an inner identification of a being whose essence is exhausted in
identity, an identification of the same-does not come to strike the terms
of some relation called separation. Separation is the very act of indi-
viduation, the possibility in general for an entity which is posited in being
300                        Totality and Infinity
to be posited not by being defined by its references to a whole, by its
place within a system, but starting from itself. The fact of starting
from oneself is equivalent to separation. But the act of starting from
oneself and separation itself can be produced in being only by opening
the dimension of interiority.


9. The Maintenance of Subjectivity
The Reality of the Inner Life
and the Reality of the State
The Meaning of Subjectivity
Metaphysics, or the relation with the other, is accomplished as service
and as hospitality. In the measure that the face of the Other relates us
with the third party, the metaphysical relation of the I with the Other
moves into the form of the We, aspires to a State, institutions, laws,
which are the source of universality. But politics left to itself bears a
tyranny within itself; it deforms the I and the other who have given rise
to it, for it judges them according to universal rules, and thus as in
absentia. In welcoming the Other I welcome the On High to which my
freedom is subordinated. But this subordination is not an absence: it is
brought about in all the personal work of my moral initiative (without
which the truth of judgment cannot be produced), in the attention to the
Other as unicity and face ( which the visibleness of the political leaves
invisible), which can be prodµced only in the unicity of an I.
Subjectivity is thus rehabilitated in the work of truth, and not as an
egoism refusing the system which offends it. Against this egoist protesta-
tion of the subjectivity, against this protestation in the first person, the
universalism of Hegelian reality will perhaps prevail. But how could
universal, that is, visible principles be opposed with this same pride to the
face of the other, without recoiling before the cruelty of this impersonal
justice! And then how could the subjectivity of the I not be introduced
as the sole possible source of goodness?
Metaphysics therefore leads us to the accomplishment of the I as
unicity by relation to which the work of the State must be situated, and
which it must take as a model.
The irreplaceable unicity of the I which is maintained against the
State is accomplished by fecundity. It is not to purely subjective events,
losing themselves in the sands of interiority which the rational reality
mocks, that we appeal to in insisting on the irreducibility of the personal
Conclusions                              301
to the universality of the State; we appeal to a dimension and a perspec-
tive of transcendence as real as the dimension and perspective of the
political and more true than it, because in it the apology of the ipseity
does not disappear. The interiority opened up by separation is not the
ineffable of the clandestine or the subterranean-but the infinite time of
fecundity. Fecundity permits the assuming of the actual as the vestibule
of a future. It opens the subterranean, where a life called inward or
merely subjective seemed to take refuge, upon being.
The subjectivity present to the judgment of truth is therefore not
reducible simply to an impotent, clandestine, unforeseeable, and from the
outside invisible protestation against totality and objective totalization.
And yet its entry into being is not wrought as an integration into a
totality the separation had broken up. Fecundity and the perspectives it
opens evince the ontological character of separation. But fecundity does
not join together the fragments of a broken totality into a subjective
history. Fecundity opens up an infinite and discontinuous time. It
liberates the subject from his facticity by placing him beyond the possible
which presupposes and does not surpass facticity; it lifts from the subject
the last trace of fatality, by enabling him to be an other. In eros the
fundamental exigencies of the subjectivity are maintained-but in this
alterity the ipseity is graceful, lightened of egoist unwieldiness.


10. Beyond Being
Thematization does not exhaust the meaning of the relationship
with exteriority. Thematization or objectification is not to be described
only as an impassive contemplation, but is to be described as a rela-
tion with the solid, with the thing, since Aristotle the term of the analogy
of being. The solid is not reducible to the structures imposed by the im-
passibility of the look that contemplates it; it is to be understood in terms
of the structures imposed by its relation with time-which it traverses.
The being of the object is perduration, a filling of the time which is
empty and inconsolable against death as an end. If exteriority consists
not in being presented as a theme but in being open to desire, the exist-
ence of the separated being which desires exteriority no longer consists in
caring for Being. To exist has a meaning in another dimension than
that of the perduration of the totality; it can go beyond being. Contrary
to the Spinozist tradition, this going beyond death is produced not in the
universality of thought but in the pluralist relation, in the goodness
302                         Totality and Infinity
of being for the Other, in justice. The surpassing of being starting from
being-the relation with exteriority-is not measured by duration,
Duration itself becomes visible in the relation with the Other, where
being is surpassed.


11. Freedom Invested
The presence of exteriority in language, which commences with the
presence of the face, is not produced as an affirmation whose formal
meaning would remain without development. The relation with the
face is produced as goodness. The exteriority of being is morality itself.
Freedom, the event of separation in arbitrariness which constitutes the I,
at the same time maintains the relation with the exteriority that morally
resists every appropriation and every totalization in being. If freedom
were posited outside of this relation, every relation within multiplicity
would enact but the grasp of one being by another or their common
participation in reason, where no being looks at the face of the other, but
all beings negate one another. Knowledge or violence would appear in
the midst of the multiplicity as events that realize being. The common
knowledge proceeds toward unity, either toward the apparition in the
midst of a multiplicity of beings of a rational system in which these
beings would be but objects, and in which they would find their being-
or toward the brutal conquest of beings outside of every system by
violence. Whether in scientific thought or in the object of science, or in
history understood as a manifestation of reason, where violence reveals
itself to be reason, philosophy presents itself as a realization of being, that
is, as its liberation by the suppression of multiplicity. Knowledge would
be the suppression of the other by the grasp, by the hold, or by the vision
that grasps before the grasp. In this work metaphysics has an entirely
different meaning. If its movement leads to the transcendent as such,
transcendence means not appropriation of what is, but its respect. Truth
as a respect for being is the meaning of metaphysical truth.
If, in contradistinction to the tradition of the primacy of freedom,
taken as the measure of being, we contest vision its primacy in being, and
contest the pretension of human emprbe to gain access to the rank of
logos, we take leave neither of rationalism, nor of the ideal of freedom.
One is not an irrationalist nor a mystic nor a pragmatist for questioning
the identification of power and logos. One is not against freedom if one
seeks for it a justification. Reason and freedom seem to us to be founded
Conclusions                              303
on prior structures of being whose first articulations are delineated by the
metaphysical movement, or respect, or justice--identical to truth. The
terms of the conception making truth rest on freedom must be inverted.
What justification there is in truth does not rest on freedom posited as
independence in regard to all exteriority. It would be so, to be sure, if
justified freedom would simply express the necessities rational order
imposes on the subject. But true exteriority is metaphysical; it does not
weigh on the separated being and commands him as free. The present
work has sought to describe metaphysical exteriority. One of the conse-
quences that follows from its very notion is that freedom is posited as
requiring justification. The founding of truth on freedom would imply
a freedom justified by itself. There would have been for freedom no
greater scandal than to discover itself to be finite. To not have chosen
one's freedom would be the supreme absurdity and the supreme tragic of
existence; this would be the irrational. The Heideggerian Geworfen-
heit marks a finite freedom and thus the irrational. The encounter with
the Other in Sartre threatens my freedom, and is equivalent to the fall of
my freedom under the gaze of another freedom. Here perhaps is
manifested most forcefully being's incompatibility with what remains
veritably exterior. But to us here there rather appears the problem of
the justification of freedom: does not the presence of the Other put in
question the naive legitimacy of freedom? Does not freedom appear
to itself as a shame for itself? And, reduced to itself, as a usurpation?
The irrational in freedom is not due to its limits, but to the infinity of
its arbitrariness. Freedom must justify itself; reduced to itself it is
accomplished not in sovereignty but in arbitrariness. Precisely through
freedom-and not because of its limitation-the being freedom is to ex-
press in its plentitude appears as not having its reason in itself. Freedom
is not justified by freedom. To account for being or to be in truth is not
to comprehend nor to take hold of • • • , but rather to encounter the
Other without allergy, that is, in justice.
To approach the Other is to put into question my freedom, my
spontaneity as a living being, my emprise over the things, this freedom of
a "moving force," this impetuosity of the current to which everything is
permitted, even murder. The "You shall not commit murder" which
delineates the face in which the Other is produced submits my freedom to
judgment. Then the free adherence to truth, an activity of knowledge,
the free will which, according to Descartes, in certitude adheres to a
clear idea, seeks a reason which does not coincide with the radiance of
304                        Totality and Infinity
this clear and distinct idea itself. A clear idea which imposes itself by its
clarity calls for a strictly personal work of a freedom, a solitary freedom
that does not put itself in question, but can at most suffer a failure. In
morality alone it is put in question. Morality thus presides over the
work of truth.
It will be said that the radicaJ questioning of certitude reduces itself to
the search for another certitude: the justification of freedom would refer
to freedom. Indeed that is so, in the measure that justification cannot
result in non-certitude. But in fact, the moral justification of freedom is
neither certitude nor incertitude. It does not have the status of a result,
but is accomplished as movement and life; it consists in addressing an
infinite exigency to one's freedom, in having a radical non-indulgence for
one's freedom. Freedom is not justified in the consciousness of certitude,
but in an infinite exigency with regard to oneself, in the overcoming of
all good conscience. But this infinite exigency with regard to oneself,
precisely because it puts freedom in question, places me and maintains me
in a situation in which I am not alone, in which I am judged. This is
the primary sociality: the personal relation is in the rigor of justice which
judges me and not in love that excuses me. For this judgment does not
come to me from a Neuter; before the Neuter I am spontaneously free.
In the infinite exigency with regard to oneself is produced the duality of
the face to face. One does not prove God thus, since this is a situation
that precedes proof, and is metaphysics itself. The ethical, beyond vision
and certitude, delineates the structure of exteriority as such. Morality is
not a branch of philosophy, but first philosophy.


12. Being as Goodness-the I-Pluralism-Peace
We have posited metaphysics as Desire. We have described Desire as
the "measure" of the Infinite which no term, no satisfaction arrests
( Desire opposed to Need). The discontinuity of generations, that is,
death and fecundity, releases Desire from the prison of its own subjectiv-
ity and puts an end to the monotony of its identity. To posit metaphys-
ics as Desire is to interpret the production of being-desire engendering
Desire-as goodness and as beyond happiness; it is to interpret the
production of being as being for the Other.
But "being for the Other" is not the negation of the I, engulfed in the
universal. The universal law itself refers to a face to face position
which refuses every exterior "viewing." To say that universality refers
Conclusions                              305
to the face to face position is ( against a whole tradition of philosophy)
to deny that being is produced as a panorama, a coexistence, of which
the face to face would be a modality. This whole work opposes this
conception. The face to face is not a modality of coexistence nor
even of the knowledge ( itself panoramic) one term can have of another,
but is the primordial production of being on which all the possible collo-
cations of the terms are founded. The revelation of the third party, in-
eluctable in the face, is produced only through the face. Goodness does
not radiate over the anonymity of a collectivity presenting itself pano-
ramically, to be absorbed into it. It concerns a being which is revealed in
a face, but thus it does not have eternity without commencement. It has
a principle, an origin, issues from an I, is subjective. It is not regulated
by the principles inscribed in the nature of a particular being that mani-
fests it ( for thus it would still proceed from universality and would not
respond to the face) , nor in the codes of the State. It consists in going
where no clarifying-that is, panoramic-thought precedes, in going
without knowing where. An absolute adventure, in a primal im-
prudence, goodness is transcendence itself. Transcendence is the tran-
scendence of an I. Only an I can respond to the injunction of a face.
The I is conserved then in goodness, without its resistance to system
manifesting itself as the egoist cry of the subjectivity, still concerned for
happiness or salvation, as in Kierkegaard. To posit being as Desire is to
decline at the same time the ontology of isolated subjectivity and the
ontology of impersonal reasol'! realizing itself in history.
To posit being as Desire and as goodness is not to first isolate an I
which would then tend toward a beyond. It is to affirm that to
apprehend oneself from within-to produce oneself as I-is to apprehend
oneself with the same gesture that already turns toward the exterior to
extra-vert and to manifest-to respond for what it apprehends--to
express; it is to affirm that the becoming-conscious is already language,
that the essence of language is goodness, or again, that the essence
of language is friendship and hospitality. The other is not the nega-
tion of the same, as Hegel would like to say. The fundamental fact of
the ontological scission into same and other is a non-allergic relation
of the same with the other.
Transcendence or goodness is produced as pluralism. The pluralism
of being is not produced as a multiplicity of a constellation spread out
before a possible gaze, for thus it would be already totalized, joined into
an entity. Pluralism is accomplished in goodness proceeding from me
306                        Totality and Infinity
to the other, in which :first the other, as absolutely other, can be
produced, without an alleged lateral view upon this movement having
any right to grasp of it a truth superior to that which is produced in
goodness itself. One does not enter into this pluralist society without
always remaining outside by speech (in which goodness is produced)-
but one does not leave it in order to simply see oneself inside. The unity
of plurality is peace, and not the coherence of the elements that constitute
plurality. Peace therefore cannot be identified with the end of combats
that cease for want of combatants, by the defeat of some and the victory
of the others, that is, with cemetaries or future universal empires. Peace
must be my peace, in a relation that starts from an I and goes to the
other, in desire and goodness, where the I both maintains itself and exists
without egoism. It is conceived starting from an I assured of the
convergence of morality and reality, that is, of an infinite time which
through fecundity is its time. It will remain a personal I before the
judgment in which truth is stated, and this judgment will come from
outside of it without coming from an impersonal reason, which uses ruse
with persons and is pronounced in their absence.
The situation in which the I thus posits itself before truth in placing
its subjective morality in the infinite time of its fecundity-a situation in
which the instant of eroticism and the infinity of paternity are con joined
-is concretized in the marvel of the family. The family does not only
result from a rational arrangement of animality; it does not simply mark
a step toward the anonymous universality of the State. It identifies itself
outside of the State, even if the State reserves a framework for it. As
source of human time it permits the subjectivity to place itself under a
judgment while retaining speech. This is a metaphysically ineluctable
structure which the State would not dismiss, as in Plato, nor make exist
in view of its own disappearance, as Hegel would have it. The biologi-
cal structure of fecundity is not limited to the biological fact. In the
biological fact of fecundity are outlined the lineaments of fecundity in
general as a relation between man and man and between the I and itself
not resembling the structures constitutive of the State, lineaments of a
reality that is not subordinated to the State as a means and does not
represent a reduced model of the State.
Situated at the antipodes of the subject living in the infinite time
of fecundity is the isolated and heroic being that the State produces by
its virile virtues. Such a being confronts death out of pure courage
and whatever be the cause for which he dies. He assumes finite time, the
Conclusions                             307
death-end or the death-transition, which do not arrest the continuation
of a being without discontinuity. The heroic existence, the isolated soul,
can gain its salvation in seeking an eternal life for itself, as though its
subjectivity, returning to itself in a continuous time, could not be turned
against it-as though in this continuous time identity itself would
not be affirmed obsessively, as though in the identity that remains in the
midst of the most extravagant avatars "tedium, fruit of the mournful
incuriosity that takes on the proportions of immortality" did not triumph.
