## **INTRODUCTORY NOTE**

![img122.jpg](images/001047.jpg)

 

OF THE LIFE of Æschylus, the first of the three great masters of Greek tragedy, only a very meager outline has come down to us. He was born at Eleusis, near Athens, B. C. 525, the son of Euphorion. Before he was twenty-five he began to compete for the tragic prize, but did not win a victory for twelve years. He spent two periods of years in Sicily, where he died in 456, killed, it is said, by a tortoise which an eagle dropped on his head. Though a professional writer, he did his share of fighting for his country, and is reported to have taken part in the battles of Marathon, Salamis, and Platæa.

Of the seventy or eighty plays which he is said to have written, only seven survive: “The Persians,” dealing with the defeat of Xerxes at Salamis; “The Seven against Thebes,” part of a tetralogy on the legend of Thebes; “The Suppliants,” on the daughters of Danaüs; “Prometheus Bound,” part of a trilogy, of which the first part was probably “Prometheus, the Fire-Bringer,” and the last “Prometheus Unbound”; and the “Oresteia,” the only example of a complete Greek tragic trilogy which has come down to us, consisting of the “Agamemnon,” the “Choephoræ” \(“The Libation-Bearers”\), and the “Eumenides” \(“The Furies”\).

The importance of Æschylus in the development of the drama is immense. Before him tragedy had consisted of the chorus and one actor; and by introducing a second actor, expanding the dramatic dialogue thus made possible, and reducing the lyrical parts, he practically created Greek tragedy as we understand it. Like other writers of his time, he acted in his own plays, and trained the chorus in their dances and songs; and he did much to give impressiveness to the performances by his development of the accessories of scene and costume on the stage. The Oresteian trilogy on “The House of Atreus” is one of the supreme productions of all literature. It deals with the two great themes of the retribution of crime and the inheritance of evil; and here again a parallel may be found between the assertions of the justice of God by Æschylus and by the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel. Both contend against the popular idea that the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children’s teeth are set on edge; both maintain that the soul that sinneth, it shall die. The nobility of thought and the majesty of style with which these ideas are set forth give this triple drama its place at the head of the literary masterpieces of the antique world.

A WATCHMAN

I PRAY the gods to quit me of my toils,**  
**To close the watch I keep, this livelong year;**  
**For as a watch-dog lying, not at rest,**  
**Propped on one arm, upon the palace-roof**  
**Of Atreus’ race, too long, too well I know**  
**The starry conclave of the midnight sky,**  
**Too well, the splendours of the firmament,**  
**The lords of light, whose kingly aspect shows — **  
**What time they set or climb the sky in turn — **  
**The year’s divisions, bringing frost or fire.**  
**And now, as ever, am I set to mark**  
**When shall stream up the glow of signal-flame,**  
**The bale-fire bright, and tell its Trojan tale — **  
***Troy town is ta’en:* such issue holds in hope**  
**She in whose woman’s breast beats heart of man.**  
**Thus upon mine unrestful couch I lie,**  
**Bathed with the dews of night, unvisited**  
**By dreams — ah me\! — for in the place of sleep**  
**Stands Fear as my familiar, and repels**  
**The soft repose that would mine eyelids seal.**  
**And if at whiles, for the lost balm of sleep,**  
**I medicine my soul with melody**  
**Of trill or song — anon to tears I turn,**  
**Wailing the woe that broods upon this home,**  
**Not now by honour guided as of old.**  
**But now at last fair fall the welcome hour**  
**That sets me free, whene’er the thick night glow**  
**With beacon-fire of hope deferred no more.**  
**All hail\!  \[*A beacon-light is seen reddening the distant sky.***  
**Fire of the night, that brings my spirit day,**  
**Shedding on Argos light, and dance, and song.**  
**Greetings to fortune, hail\!**  
**Let my loud summons ring within the ears**  
**Of Agamemnon’s queen, that she anon**  
**Start from her couch and with a shrill voice cry**  
**A joyous welcome to the beacon-blaze,**  
**For Ilion’s fall; such fiery message gleams**  
**From yon high flame; and I, before the rest,**  
**Will foot the lightsome measure of our joy;**  
**For I can say, *My master’s dice fell fair — ***  
***Behold\! the triple sice, the lucky flame\!***  
**Now be my lot to clasp, in loyal love,**  
**The hand of him restored, who rules our home:**  
**Home — but I say no more: upon my tongue**  
**Treads hard the ox o’ the adage.**  
**Had it voice,**  
**The home itself might soothliest tell its tale;**  
**I, of set will, speak words the wise may learn,**  
**To others, nought remember nor discern.  \[*Exit. The chorus of old men of Mycenæ enter, each leaning on a staff. During their song Clytemnestra appears in the background, kindling the altars.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Ten livelong years have rolled away,**  
**Since the twin lords of sceptred sway,**  
**By Zeus endowed with pride of place,**  
**The doughty chiefs of Atreus’ race,**  
**Went forth of yore,**  
**To plead with Priam, face to face,**  
**Before the judgment-seat of War\!**  
**A thousand ships from Argive land**  
**Put forth to bear the martial band,**  
**That with a spirit stern and strong**  
**Went out to right the kingdom’s wrong — **  
**Pealed, as they went, the battle-song,**  
**Wild as the vultures’ cry;**  
**When o’er the eyrie, soaring high,**  
**In wild bereavèd agony,**  
**Around, around, in airy rings,**  
**They wheel with oarage of their wings,**  
**But not the eyas-brood behold,**  
**That called them to the nest of old;**  
**But let Apollo from the sky,**  
**Or Pan, or Zeus, but hear the cry,**  
**The exile cry, the wail forlorn,**  
**Of birds from whom their home is torn — **  
**On those who wrought the rapine fell,**  
**Heaven sends the vengeful fiends of hell.**  
**Even so doth Zeus, the jealous lord**  
**And guardian of the hearth and board,**  
**Speed Atreus’ sons, in vengeful ire,**  
**‘Gainst Paris — sends them forth on fire,**  
**Her to buy back, in war and blood,**  
**Whom one did wed but many woo’d\!**  
**And many, many, by his will,**  
**The last embrace of foes shall feel,**  
**And many a knee in dust be bowed,**  
**And splintered spears on shields ring loud,**  
**Of Trojan and of Greek, before**  
**That iron bridal-feast be o’er\!**  
**But as he willed ’tis ordered all,**  
**And woes, by heaven ordained, must fall — **  
**Unsoothed by tears or spilth of wine**  
**Poured forth too late, the wrath divine**  
**Glares vengeance on the flameless shrine.**  
**And we in gray dishonoured eld,**  
**Feeble of frame, unfit were held**  
**To join the warrior array**  
**That then went forth unto the fray:**  
**And here at home we tarry, fain**  
**Our feeble footsteps to sustain,**  
**Each on his staff — so strength doth wane,**  
**And turns to childishness again.**  
**For while the sap of youth is green,**  
**And, yet unripened, leaps within,**  
**The young are weakly as the old,**  
**And each alike unmeet to hold**  
**The vantage post of war\!**  
**And ah\! when flower and fruit are o’er,**  
**And on life’s tree the leaves are sere,**  
**Age wendeth propped its journey drear,**  
**As forceless as a child, as light**  
**And fleeting as a dream of night**  
**Lost in the garish day\!**  
**But thou, O child of Tyndareus,**  
**Queen Clytemnestra, speak\! and say**  
**What messenger of joy today**  
**Hath won thine ear? what welcome news,**  
**That thus in sacrificial wise**  
**E’en to the city’s boundaries**  
**Thou biddest altar-fires arise?**  
**Each god who doth our city guard,**  
**And keeps o’er Argos watch and ward**  
**From heaven above, from earth below — **  
**The mighty lords who rule the skies,**  
**The market’s lesser deities,**  
**To each and all the altars glow,**  
**Piled for the sacrifice\!**  
**And here and there, anear, afar,**  
**Streams skyward many a beacon-star,**  
**Conjur’d and charm’d and kindled well**  
**By pure oil’s soft and guileless spell,**  
**Hid now no more**  
**Within the palace’ secret store.**  
**O queen, we pray thee, whatsoe’er,**  
**Known unto thee, were well revealed,**  
**That thou wilt trust it to our ear,**  
**And bid our anxious heart be healed\!**  
**That waneth now unto despair — **  
**Now, waxing to a presage fair,**  
**Dawns, from the altar, Hope — to scare**  
**From our rent hearts the vulture Care.**  
**List\! for the power is mine, to chant on high**  
**The chiefs’ emprise, the strength that omens gave\!**  
**List\! on my soul breathes yet a harmony,**  
**From realms of ageless powers, and strong to save\!**  
**How brother kings, twins lords of one command,**  
**Led forth the youth of Hellas in their flower,**  
**Urged on their way, with vengeful spear and brand,**  
**By warrior-birds, that watched the parting hour.**  
***Go forth to Troy,* the eagles seemed to cry — **  
**And the sea-kings obeyed the sky-kings’ word,**  
**When on the right they soared across the sky,**  
**And one was black, one bore a white tail barred.**  
**High o’er the palace were they seen to soar,**  
**Then lit in sight of all, and rent and tare,**  
**Far from the fields that she should range no more,**  
**Big with her unborn brood, a mother-hare.**  
**And one beheld, the soldier-prophet true,**  
**And the two chiefs, unlike of soul and will,**  
**In the twy-coloured eagles straight he knew,**  
**And spake the omen forth, for good and ill.**  
**\(Ah woe and well-a-day\! but be the issue fair\!\)**  
***Go forth,* he cried, *and Priam’s town shall fall.***  
***Yet long the time shall be; and flock and herd,***  
***The people’s wealth, that roam before the wall,***  
***Shall force hew down, when Fate shall give the word.***  
***But O beware\! lest wrath in heaven abide,***  
***To dim the glowing battle-forge once more,***  
***And mar the mighty curb of Trojan pride,***  
***The steel of vengeance, welded as for war\!***  
***For virgin Artemis bears jealous hate***  
***Against the royal house, the eagle-pair,***  
***Who rend the unborn brood, insatiate — ***  
***Yea, loathes their banquet on the quivering hare.***  
**\(Ah woe and well-a-day\! but be the issue fair\!\)**  
***For well she loves — the goddess kind and mild — ***  
***The tender new-born cubs of lions bold,***  
***Too weak to range — and well the sucking child***  
***Of every beast that roams by wood and wold.***  
***So to the Lord of Heaven she prayeth still,***  
***“Nay, if it must be, be the omen true\!***  
***Yet do the visioned eagles presage ill;***  
***The end be well, but crossed with evil too\!”***  
***Healer Apollo\! be her wrath controll’d,***  
***Nor weave the long delay of thwarting gales,***  
***To war against the Danaans and withhold***  
***From the free ocean-waves their eager sails\!***  
***She craves, alas\! to see a second life***  
***Shed forth, a curst unhallowed sacrifice — ***  
***‘Twixt wedded souls, artificer of strife,***  
***And hate that knows not fear, and fell device.***  
***At home there tarries like a lurking snake,***  
***Biding its time, a wrath unreconciled,***  
***A wily watcher, passionate to slake,***  
***In blood, resentment for a murdered child.***  
**Such was the mighty warning, pealed of yore — **  
**Amid good tidings, such the word of fear,**  
**What time the fateful eagles hovered o’er**  
**The kings, and Calchas read the omen clear.**  
**\(In strains like his, once more,**  
**Sing woe and well-a-day\! but be the issue fair\!\)**  
**Zeus — if to The Unknown**  
**That name of many names seem good — **  
**Zeus, upon Thee I call.**  
**Thro’ the mind’s every road**  
**I passed, but vain are all,**  
**Save that which names thee Zeus, the Highest One,**  
**Were it but mine to cast away the load,**  
**The weary load, that weighs my spirit down.**  
**He that was Lord of old,**  
**In full-blown pride of place and valour bold,**  
**Hath fallen and is gone, even as an old tale told\!**  
**And he that next held sway,**  
**By stronger grasp o’erthrown**  
**Hath pass’d away\!**  
**And whoso now shall bid the triumph-chant arise**  
**To Zeus, and Zeus alone,**  
**He shall be found the truly wise.**  
**’Tis Zeus alone who shows the perfect way**  
**Of knowledge: He hath ruled,**  
**Men shall learn wisdom, by affliction schooled.**  
**In visions of the night, like dropping rain,**  
**Descend the many memories of pain**  
**Before the spirit’s sight: through tears and dole**  
**Comes wisdom o’er the unwilling soul — **  
**A boon, I wot, of all Divinity,**  
**That holds its sacred throne in strength, above the sky\!**  
**And then the elder chief, at whose command**  
**The fleet of Greece was manned,**  
**Cast on the seer no word of hate,**  
**But veered before the sudden breath of Fate — **  
**Ah, weary while\! for, ere they put forth sail,**  
**Did every store, each minish’d vessel, fail,**  
**While all the Achæan host**  
**At Aulis anchored lay,**  
**Looking across to Chalcis and the coast**  
**Where refluent waters welter, rock, and sway;**  
**And rife with ill delay**  
**From northern Strymon blew the thwarting blast — **  
**Mother of famine fell,**  
**That holds men wand’ring still**  
**Far from the haven where they fain would be\! — **  
**And pitiless did waste**  
**Each ship and cable, rotting on the sea,**  
**And, doubling with delay each weary hour,**  
**Withered with hope deferred th’ Achæans’ warlike flower.**  
**But when, for bitter storm, a deadlier relief,**  
**And heavier with ill to either chief,**  
**Pleading the ire of Artemis, the seer avowed,**  
**The two Atridæ smote their sceptres on the plain,**  
**And, striving hard, could not their tears restrain\!**  
**And then the elder monarch spake aloud — **  
***Ill lot were mine, to disobey\!***  
***And ill, to smite my child, my household’s love and pride\!***  
***To stain with virgin blood a father’s hands, and slay***  
***My daughter, by the altar’s side\!***  
***‘Twixt woe and woe I dwell — ***  
***I dare not like a recreant fly,***  
***And leave the league of ships, and fail each true ally;***  
***For rightfully they crave, with eager fiery mind,***  
***The virgin’s blood, shed forth to lull the adverse wind — ***  
***God send the deed be well\!***  
**Thus on this neck he took**  
**Fate’s hard compelling yoke;**  
**Then, in the counter-gale of will abhorr’d, accursed,**  
**To recklessness his shifting spirit veered — **  
**Alas\! that Frenzy, first of ills and worst,**  
**With evil craft men’s souls to sin hath ever stirred\!**  
**And so he steeled his heart — ah, well-a-day — **  
**Aiding a war for one false woman’s sake,**  
**His child to slay,**  
**And with her spilt blood make**  
**An offering, to speed the ships upon their way\!**  
**Lusting for war, the bloody arbiters**  
**Closed heart and ears, and would nor hear nor heed**  
**The girl-voice plead,**  
***Pity me, Father\!* nor her prayers,**  
**Nor tender, virgin years.**  
**So, when the chant of sacrifice was done,**  
**Her father bade the youthful priestly train**  
**Raise her, like some poor kid, above the altar-stone,**  
**From where amid her robes she lay**  
**Sunk all in swoon away — **  
**Bade them, as with the bit that mutely tames the steed,**  
**Her fair lips’ speech refrain,**  
**Lest she should speak a curse on Atreus’ home and seed,**  
**So trailing on the earth her robe of saffron dye,**  
**With one last piteous dart from her beseeching eye**  
**Those that should smite she smote — **  
**Fair, silent, as a pictur’d form, but fain**  
**To plead, *Is all forgot?***  
***How oft those halls of old,***  
***Wherein my sire high feast did hold,***  
***Rang to the virginal soft strain,***  
***When I, a stainless child,***  
***Sang from pure lips and undefiled,***  
***Sang of my sire, and all***  
***His honoured life, and how on him should fall***  
***Heaven’s highest gift and gain\!***  
**And then — but I beheld not, nor can tell,**  
**What further fate befel:**  
**But this is sure, that Calchas’ boding strain**  
**Can ne’er be void or vain.**  
**This wage from Justice’ hand do sufferers earn,**  
**The future to discern;**  
**And yet — farewell, O secret of tomorrow\!**  
**Foreknowledge is fore-sorrow.**  
**Clear with the clear beams of the morrow’s sun,**  
**The future presseth on.**  
**Now, let the house’s tale, how dark soe’er,**  
**Find yet an issue fair\! — **  
**So prays the loyal, solitary band**  
**That guards the Apian land.  \[*They turn to Clytemnestra, who leaves the altars and comes forward.***  
**O queen, I come in reverence of thy sway — **  
**For, while the ruler’s kingly seat is void,**  
**The loyal heart before his consort bends.**  
**Now — be it sure and certain news of good,**  
**Or the fair tidings of a flatt’ring hope,**  
**That bids thee spread the light from shrine to shrine,**  
**I, fain to hear, yet grudge not if thou hide.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**As saith the adage, *From the womb of Night***  
***Spring forth, with promise fair, the young child Light.***  
**Ay — fairer even than all hope my news — **  
**By Grecian hands is Priam’s city ta’en\!

 

CHORUS**  
**What say’st thou? doubtful heart makes treach’rous ear.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Hear then again, and plainly — Troy is ours\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Thrills thro’ my heart such joy as wakens tears.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Ay, thro’ those tears thine eye looks loyalty.

 

CHORUS**  
**But hast thou proof, to make assurance sure?

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Go to; I have — unless the god has lied.

 

CHORUS**  
**Hath some night-vision won thee to belief?

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Out on all presage of slumb’rous soul\!

 

CHORUS**  
**But wert thou cheered by Rumour’s wingless word?

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Peace — thou dost chide me as a credulous girl.

 

CHORUS**  
**Say then how long ago the city fell?

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Even in this night that now brings forth the dawn.

 

CHORUS**  
**Yet who so swift could speed the message here?

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**From Ida’s top Hephæstus, lord of fire,**  
**Sent forth his sign; and on, and ever on,**  
**Beacon to beacon sped the courier-flame.**  
**From Ida to the crag, that Hermes loves,**  
**Of Lemnos; thence unto the steep sublime**  
**Of Athos, throne of Zeus, the broad blaze flared.**  
**Thence, raised aloft to shoot across the sea,**  
**The moving light, rejoicing in its strength,**  
**Sped from the pyre of pine, and urged its way,**  
**In golden glory, like some strange new sun,**  
**Onward, and reached Macistus’ watching heights.**  
**There, with no dull delay nor heedless sleep,**  
**The watcher sped the tidings on in turn,**  
**Until the guard upon Messapius’ peak**  
**Saw the far flame gleam on Euripus’ tide,**  
**And from the high-piled heap of withered furze**  
**Lit the new sign and bade the message on.**  
**Then the strong light, far flown and yet undimmed,**  
**Shot thro’ the sky above Asopus’ plain,**  
**Bright as the moon, and on Cithæron’s crag**  
**Aroused another watch of flying fire.**  
**And there the sentinels no whit disowned,**  
**But sent redoubled on, the hest of flame — **  
**Swift shot the light, above Gorgopis’ bay,**  
**To Ægiplanctus’ mount, and bade the peak**  
**Fail not the onward ordinance of fire.**  
**And like a long beard streaming in the wind,**  
**Full-fed with fuel, roared and rose the blaze,**  
**And onward flaring, gleamed above the cape,**  
**Beneath which shimmers the Saronic bay,**  
**And thence leapt light unto Arachne’s peak,**  
**The mountain watch that looks upon our town.**  
**Thence to th’ Atrides’ roof — in lineage fair,**  
**A bright posterity of Ida’s fire.**  
**So sped from stage to stage, fulfilled in turn,**  
**Flame after flame, along the course ordained,**  
**And lo\! the last to speed upon its way**  
**Sights the end first, and glows unto the goal.**  
**And Troy is ta’en, and by this sign my lord**  
**Tells me the tale, and ye have learned my word.

 

CHORUS**  
**To heaven, O queen, will I upraise new song:**  
**But, wouldst thou speak once more, I fain would hear**  
**From first to last the marvel of the tale.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Think you — this very morn — the Greeks in Troy,**  
**And loud therein the voice of utter wail\!**  
**Within one cup pour vinegar and oil,**  
**And look\! unblent, unreconciled, they war.**  
**So in the twofold issue of the strife**  
**Mingle the victor’s shout, the captives’ moan.**  
**For all the conquered whom the sword has spared**  
**Cling weeping — some unto a brother Slain,**  
**Some childlike to a nursing father’s form,**  
**And wail the loved and lost, the while their neck**  
**Bows down already ‘neath the captive’s chain.**  
**And lo\! the victors, now the fight is done,**  
**Goaded by restless hunger, far and wide**  
**Range all disordered thro’ the town, to snatch**  
**Such vitual and such rest as chance may give**  
**Within the captive halls that once were Troy — **  
**Joyful to rid them of the frost and dew,**  
**Wherein they couched upon the plain of old — **  
**Joyful to sleep the gracious night all through,**  
**Unsummoned of the watching sentinel.**  
**Yet let them reverence well the city’s gods,**  
**The lords of Troy, tho’ fallen, and her shrines;**  
**So shall the spoilers not in turn be spoiled.**  
**Yea, let no craving for forbidden gain**  
**Bid conquerors yield before the darts of greed.**  
**For we need yet, before the race be won,**  
**Homewards, unharmed, to round the course once more.**  
**For should the host wax wanton ere it come,**  
**Then, tho’ the sudden blow of fate be spared,**  
**Yet in the sight of gods shall rise once more**  
**The great wrong of the slain, to claim revenge.**  
**Now, hearing from this woman’s mouth of mine,**  
**The tale and eke its warning, pray with me,**  
**Luck sway the scale, with no uncertain poise,**  
**For my fair hopes are changed to fairer joys.

 

CHORUS**  
**A gracious word thy woman’s lips have told,**  
**Worthy a wise man’s utterance, O my queen;**  
**Now with clear trust in thy convincing tale**  
**I set me to salute the gods with song,**  
**Who bring us bliss to counterpoise our pain.  \[*Exit Clytemnestra.***  
**Zeus, Lord of heaven\! and welcome night**  
**Of victory, that hast our might**  
**With all the glories crowned\!**  
**On towers of Ilion, free no more,**  
**Hast flung the mighty mesh of war,**  
**And closely girt them round,**  
**Till neither warrior may ‘scape,**  
**Nor stripling lightly overleap**  
**The trammels as they close, and close,**  
**Till with the grip of doom our foes**  
**In slavery’s coil are bound\!**  
**Zeus, Lord of hospitality,**  
**In grateful awe I bend to thee — **  
**’Tis thou hast struck the blow\!**  
**At Alexander, long ago,**  
**We marked thee bend thy vengeful bow,**  
**But long and warily withhold**  
**The eager shaft, which uncontrolled**  
**And loosed too soon or launched too high,**  
**Had wandered bloodless through the sky.**  
**Zeus, the high God\! — whate’er be dim in doubt,**  
**This can our thought track out — **  
**The blow that fells the sinner is of God,**  
**And as he wills, the rod**  
**Of vengeance smiteth sore. One said of old,**  
***The gods list not to hold***  
***A reckoning with him whose feet oppress***  
***The grace of holiness — ***  
**An impious word\! for whensoe’er the sire**  
**Breathed forth rebellious fire — **  
**What time his household overflowed the measure**  
**Of bliss and health and treasure — **  
**His children’s children read the reckoning plain,**  
**At last, in tears and pain.**  
**On me let weal that brings no woe be sent,**  
**And therewithal, content\!**  
**Who spurns the shrine of Right, nor wealth nor power**  
**Shall be to him a tower,**  
**To guard him from the gulf: there lies his lot,**  
**Where all things are forgot.**  
**Lust drives him on — lust, desperate and wild,**  
**Fate’s sin-contriving child — **  
**And cure is none; beyond concealment clear,**  
**Kindles sin’s baleful glare.**  
**As an ill coin beneath the wearing touch**  
**Betrays by stain and smutch**  
**Its metal false — such is the sinful wight.**  
**Before, on pinions light,**  
**Fair Pleasure flits, and lures him childlike on,**  
**While home and kin make moan**  
**Beneath the grinding burden of his crime;**  
**Till, in the end of time,**  
**Cast down of heaven, he pours forth fruitless prayer**  
**To powers that will not hear.**  
**And such did Paris come**  
**Unto Atrides’ home,**  
**And thence, with sin and shame his welcome to repay,**  
**Ravished the wife away — **  
**And she, unto her country and her kin**  
**Leaving the clash of shields and spears and arming ships,**  
**And bearing unto Troy destruction for a dower,**  
**And overbold in sin,**  
**Went fleetly thro’ the gates, at midnight hour.**  
**Oft from the prophets’ lips**  
**Moaned out the warning and the wail — Ah woe\!**  
**Woe for the home, the home\! and for the chieftains, woe\!**  
**Woe for the bride-bed, warm**  
**Yet from the lovely limbs, the impress of the form**  
**Of her who loved her lord, a while ago\!**  
**And woe\! for him who stands**  
**Shamed, silent, unreproachful, stretching hands**  
**That find her not, and sees, yet will not see,**  
**That she is far away\!**  
**And his sad fancy, yearning o’er the sea,**  
**Shall summon and recall**  
**Her wraith, once more to queen it in his hall.**  
**And sad with many memories,**  
**The fair cold beauty of each sculptured face — **  
**And all to hatefulness is turned their grace,**  
**Seen blankly by forlorn and hungering eyes\!**  
**And when the night is deep,**  
**Come visions, sweet and sad, and bearing pain**  
**Of hopings vain — **  
**Void, void and vain, for scarce the sleeping sight**  
**Has seen its old delight,**  
**When thro’ the grasps of love that bid it stay**  
**It vanishes away**  
**On silent wings that roam adown the ways of sleep.**  
**Such are the sights, the sorrows fell,**  
**About our hearth — and worse, whereof I may not tell.**  
**But, all the wide town o’er,**  
**Each home that sent its master far away**  
**From Hellas’ shore,**  
**Feels the keen thrill of heart, the pang of loss, today.**  
**For, truth to say,**  
**The touch of bitter death is manifold\!**  
**Familiar was each face, and dear as life,**  
**That went unto the war,**  
**But thither, whence a warrior went of old,**  
**Doth nought return — **  
**Only a spear and sword, and ashes in an urn\!**  
**For Ares, lord of strife,**  
**Who doth the swaying scales of battle hold,**  
**War’s money-changer, giving dust for gold,**  
**Sends back, to hearts that held them dear,**  
**Scant ash of warriors, wept with many a tear,**  
**Light to the hand, but heavy to the soul;**  
**Yea, fills the light urn full**  
**With what survived the flame — **  
**Death’s dusty measure of a hero’s frame\!**  
***Alas\!* one cries, *and yet alas again\!***  
***Our chief is gone, the hero of the spear,***  
***And hath not left his peer\!***  
***Ah woe\!* another moans — *my spouse is slain,***  
***The death of honour, rolled in dust and blood,***  
***Slain for a woman’s sin, a false wife’s shame\!***  
**Such muttered words of bitter mood**  
**Rise against those who went forth to reclaim;**  
**Yea, jealous wrath creeps on against th’ Atrides’ name.**  
**And others, far beneath the Ilian wall,**  
**Sleep their last sleep — the goodly chiefs and tall,**  
**Couched in the foeman’s land, whereon they gave**  
**Their breath, and lords of Troy, each in his Trojan grave.**  
**Therefore for each and all the city’s breast**  
**Is heavy with a wrath supprest,**  
**As deep and deadly as a curse more loud**  
**Flung by the common crowd;**  
**And, brooding deeply, doth my soul await**  
**Tidings of coming fate,**  
**Buried as yet in darkness’ womb.**  
**For not forgetful is the high gods’ doom**  
**Against the sons of carnage: all too long**  
**Seems the unjust to prosper and be strong,**  
**Till the dark Furies come,**  
**And smite with stern reversal all his home,**  
**Down into dim obstruction — he is gone,**  
**And help and hope, among the lost, is none\!**  
**O’er him who vaunteth an exceeding fame,**  
**Impends a woe condign;**  
**The vengeful bolt upon his eyes doth flame,**  
**Sped from the hand divine.**  
**This bliss be mine, ungrudged of God, to feel — **  
**To tread no city to the dust,**  
**Nor see my own life thrust**  
**Down to a slave’s estate beneath another’s heel\!**  
**Behold, throughout the city wide**  
**Have the swift feet of Rumour hied,**  
**Roused by the joyful flame:**  
**But is the news they scatter, sooth?**  
**Or haply do they give for truth**  
**Some cheat which heaven doth frame?**  
**A child were he and all unwise,**  
**Who let his heart with joy be stirred,**  
**To see the beacon-fires arise,**  
**And then, beneath some thwarting word,**  
**Sicken anon with hope deferred.**  
**The edge of woman’s insight still**  
**Good news from true divideth ill;**  
**Light rumours leap within the bound**  
**That fences female credence round,**  
**But, lightly born, as lightly dies**  
**The tale that springs of her surmise.**  
**Soon shall we know whereof the bale-fires tell,**  
**The beacons, kindled with transmitted flame;**  
**Whether, as well I deem, their tale is true,**  
**Or whether like some dream delusive came**  
**The welcome blaze but to befool our soul.**  
**For lo\! I see a herald from the shore**  
**Draw hither, shadowed with the olive-wreath — **  
**And thirsty dust, twin-brother of the clay,**  
**Speaks plain of travel far and truthful news — **  
**No dumb surmise, nor tongue of flame in smoke,**  
**Fitfully kindled from the mountain pyre;**  
**But plainlier shall his voice say, *All is well,***  
**Or — but away, forebodings adverse, now,**  
**And on fair promise fair fulfilment come\!**  
**And whoso for the state prays otherwise,**  
**Himself reap harvest of his ill desire\!**  
**Enter HERALD**  
**O land of Argos, fatherland of mine\!**  
**To thee at last, beneath the tenth year’s sun,**  
**My feet return; the bark of my emprise,**  
**Tho’ one by one hope’s anchors broke away,**  
**Held by the last, and now rides safely here.**  
**Long, long my soul despaired to win, in death,**  
**Its longed-for rest within our Argive land:**  
**And now all hail, O earth, and hail to thee,**  
**New-risen sun\! and hail our country’s God,**  
**High-ruling Zeus, and thou, the Pythian lord,**  
**Whose arrows smote us once — smite thou no more\!**  
**Was not thy wrath wreaked full upon our heads,**  
**O king Apollo, by Scamander’s side?**  
**Turn thou, be turned, be saviour, healer, now\!**  
**And hail, all gods who rule the street and mart,**  
**And Hermes hail\! my patron and my pride,**  
**Herald of heaven, and lord of heralds here\!**  
**And Heroes, ye who sped us on our way — **  
**To one and all I cry, *Receive again***  
***With grace such Argives as the spear has spared.***  
**Ah, home of royalty, beloved halls,**  
**And solemn shrines, and gods that front the morn\!**  
**Benign as erst, with sun-flushed aspect greet**  
**The king returning after many days.**  
**For as from night flash out the beams of day,**  
**So out of darkness dawns a light, a king,**  
**On you, on Argos — Agamemnon comes.**  
**Then hail and greet him well\! such meed befits**  
**Him whose right hand hewed down the towers of Troy**  
**With the great axe of Zeus who righteth wrong — **  
**And smote the plain, smote down to nothingness**  
**Each altar, every shrine; and far and wide**  
**Dies from the whole land’s face its offspring fair.**  
**Such mighty yoke of fate he set on Troy — **  
**Our lord and monarch, Atreus’ elder son,**  
**And comes at last with blissful honour home;**  
**Highest of all who walk on earth today — **  
**Not Paris nor the city’s self that paid**  
**Sin’s price with him, can boast, *Whate’er befal,***  
***The guerdon we have won outweighs it all.***  
**But at Fate’s judgment-seat the robber stands**  
**Condemned of rapine, and his prey is torn**  
**Forth from his hands, and by his deed is reaped**  
**A bloody harvest of his home and land**  
**Gone down to death, and for his guilt and lust**  
**His father’s race pays double in the dust.

 

CHORUS**  
**Hail, herald of the Greeks, new-come from war.

 

HERALD**  
**All hail\! not death itself can fight me now.

 

CHORUS**  
**Was thine heart wrung with longing for thy land?

 

HERALD**  
**So that this joy doth brim mine eyes with tears.

 

CHORUS**  
**On you too then this sweet distress did fall — 

 

HERALD**  
**How say’st thou? make me master of thy word.

 

CHORUS**  
**You longed for us who pined for you again.

 

HERALD**  
**Craved the land us who craved it, love for love?

 

CHORUS**  
**Yea, till my brooding heart moaned out with pain.

 

HERALD**  
**Whence they despair, that mars the army’s joy?

 

CHORUS**  
***Sole cure of wrong is silence,* saith the saw.

 

HERALD**  
**Thy kings afar, couldst thou fear other men?

 

CHORUS**  
**Death had been sweet, as thou didst say but now.

 

HERALD**  
**’Tis true; Fate smiles at last. Throughout our toil,**  
**These many years, some chances issued fair,**  
**And some, I wot, were chequered with a curse.**  
**But who, on earth, hath won the bliss of heaven,**  
**Thro’ time’s whole tenor an unbroken weal?**  
**I could a tale unfold of toiling oars,**  
**Ill rest, scant landings on a shore rock-strewn,**  
**All pains, all sorrows, for our daily doom.**  
**And worse and hatefuller our woes on land;**  
**For where we couched, close by the foeman’s wall,**  
**The river-plain was ever dank with dews,**  
**Dropped from the sky, exuded from the earth,**  
**A curse that clung unto our sodden garb,**  
**And hair as horrent as a wild beast’s fell.**  
**Why tell the woes of winter, when the birds**  
**Lay stark and stiff, so stern was Ida’s snow?**  
**Or summer’s scorch, what time the stirless wave**  
**Sank to its sleep beneath the noonday sun?**  
**Why mourn old woes? their pain has passed away;**  
**And passed away, from those who fell, all care,**  
**For evermore, to rise and live again.**  
**Why sum the count of death, and render thanks**  
**For life by moaning over fate malign?**  
**Farewell, a long farewell to all our woes\!**  
**To us, the remnant of the host of Greece,**  
**Comes weal beyond all counterpoise of woe;**  
**Thus boast we rightfully to yonder sun,**  
**Like him far-fleeted over sea and land.**  
***The Argive host prevailed to conquer Troy,***  
***And in the temples of the gods of Greece***  
***Hung up these spoils, a shining sign to Time.***  
**Let those who learn this legend bless aright**  
**The city and its chieftains, and repay**  
**The meed of gratitude of Zeus who willed**  
**And wrought the deed. So stands the tale fulfilled.

 

CHORUS**  
**Thy words o’erbear my doubt: for news of good,**  
**The ear of age hath ever youth enow:**  
**But those within the Clytemnestra’s self**  
**Would fain hear all; glad thou their ears and mine.**  
***Re-enter CLYTEMNESTRA***  
***Last night, when first the fiery courier came,***  
**In sign that Troy is ta’en and razed to earth,**  
**So wild a cry of joy my lips gave out,**  
**That I was chidden — *Hath the beacon watch***  
***Made sure unto thy soul the sack to Troy?***  
***A very woman thou, whose heart leaps light***  
***At wandering rumours\!* — and with words like these**  
**They showed me how I strayed, misled of hope.**  
**Yet on each shrine I set the sacrifice,**  
**And, in the strain they held for feminine,**  
**Went heralds thro’ the city, to and fro,**  
**With voice of loud proclaim, announcing joy;**  
**And in each fane they lit and quenched with wine**  
**The spicy perfumes fading in the flame.**  
**All is fulfilled: I spare your longer tale — **  
**The king himself anon shall tell me all.**  
**Remains to think what honour best may greet**  
**My lord, the majesty of Argos, home.**  
**What day beams fairer on a woman’s eyes**  
**Than this whereon she flings the portal wide,**  
**To hail her lord, heaven-shielded, home from war?**  
**This to my husband, that he tarry not,**  
**But turn the city’s longing into joy\!**  
**Yea, let him come, and coming may he find**  
**A wife no other than he left her, true**  
**And faithful as a watch-dog to his home,**  
**His foemen’s foe, in all her duties leal,**  
**Trusty to keep for ten long years unmarred**  
**The store whereon he set his master-seal.**  
**Be steel deep-dyed, before ye look to see**  
**Ill joy, ill fame, from other wight, in me\!

 

HERALD**  
**’Tis fairly said: thus speaks a noble dame,**  
**Nor speaks amiss, when truth informs the boast.  \[*Exit Clytemnestra.*

 

CHORUS**  
**So has she spoken — be it yours to learn**  
**By clear interpreters her specious word.**  
**Turn to me, herald — tell me if anon**  
**The second well-loved lord of Argos comes?**  
**Hath Menelaus safely sped with you?

 

HERALD**  
**Alas — brief boon unto my friends it were,**  
**To flatter them, for truth, with falsehoods fair\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Speak joy if truth be joy, but truth, at worst — **  
**Too plainly, truth and joy are her divorced.

 

HERALD**  
**The hero and his bark were rapt away**  
**Far from the Grecian fleet? ’tis truth I say.

 

CHORUS**  
**Whether in all men’s sight from Ilion borne,**  
**Or from the fleet by stress of weather torn?

 

HERALD**  
**Full on the mark thy shaft of speech doth light,**  
**And one short word hath told long woes aright.

 

CHORUS**  
**But say what now of him each comrade saith?**  
**What their forebodings, of his life of death?

 

HERALD**  
**Ask me no more: the truth is known to none,**  
**Save the earth-fostering, all-surveying Sun.

 

CHORUS**  
**Say by what doom the fleet of Greece was driven?**  
**How rose, how sank the storm, the wrath of heaven?

 

HERALD**  
**Nay, ill it were to mar with sorrow’s tale**  
**The day of blissful news. The gods demand**  
**Thanksgiving sundered from solicitude.**  
**If one as herald came with rueful face**  
**To say, *The curse has fallen, and the host***  
***Gone down to death; and one wide wound has reached***  
***The city’s heart, and out of many homes***  
***Many are cast and consecrate to death,***  
***Beneath the double scourge, that Ares loves,***  
***The bloody pair, the fire and sword of doom — ***  
**If such sore burden weighed upon my tongue,**  
**‘Twere fit to speak such words as gladden fiends.**  
**But — coming as he comes who bringeth news**  
**Of safe return from toil, and issues fair,**  
**To men rejoicing in a weal restored — **  
**Dare I to dash good words with ill, and say**  
**How the gods’ anger smote the Greeks in storm?**  
**For fire and sea, that erst held bitter feud,**  
**Now swore conspiracy and pledged their faith,**  
**Wasting the Argives worn with toil and war.**  
**Night and great horror of the rising wave**  
**Came o’er us, and the blasts that blow from Thrace**  
**Clashed ship with ship, and some with plunging prow**  
**Thro’s scudding drifts of spray and raving storm**  
**Vanished, as strays by some ill shepherd driven.**  
**And when at length the sue rose bright, we saw**  
**Th’ Ægæan sea-field flecked with flowers of death,**  
**Corpses of Grecian men and shattered hulls.**  
**For us indeed, some god, as well I deem,**  
**No human power, laid hand upon our helm,**  
**Snatched us or prayed us from the powers of air,**  
**And brought our bark thro’ all, unharmed in hull:**  
**And saving Fortune sat and steered us fair,**  
**So that no surge should gulf us deep in brine,**  
**Nor grind our keel upon a rocky shore.**  
**So ‘scaped we death that lurks beneath the sea,**  
**But, under day’s white light, mistrustful all**  
**Of fortune’s smile, we sat and brooded deep,**  
**Shepherds forlorn of thoughts that wandered wild,**  
**O’er this new woe; for smitten was our host,**  
**And lost as ashes scattered from the pyre.**  
**Of whom if any draw his life-breath yet,**  
**Be well assured, he deems of us as dead,**  
**As we of him no other fate forebode.**  
**But heaven save all\! If Menelaus live,**  
**He will not tarry, but will surely come:**  
**Therefore if anywhere the high sun’s ray**  
**Descries him upon earth, preserved by Zeus,**  
**Who wills not yet to wipe his race away,**  
**Hope still there is that homeward he may wend.**  
**Enough — thou hast the truth unto the end.

 

CHORUS**  
**Say from whose lips the presage fell?**  
**Who read the future all too well,**  
**And named her, in her natal hour,**  
**Helen, the bride with war for dower?**  
**’Twas one of the Invisible,**  
**Guiding his tongue with prescient power.**  
**On fleet, and host, and citadel,**  
**War, sprung from her, and death did lour,**  
**When from the bride-bed’s fine-spun veil**  
**She to the Zephyr spread her sail.**  
**Strong blew the breeze — the surge closed o’er**  
**The cloven track of keel and oar,**  
**But while she fled, there drove along,**  
**Fast in her wake, a mighty throng — **  
**Athirst for blood, athirst for war,**  
**Forward in fell pursuit they sprung,**  
**Then leapt on Simois’ bank ashore,**  
**The leafy coppices among — **  
**No rangers, they, of wood and field,**  
**But huntsmen of the sword and shield.**  
**Heaven’s jealousy, that works its will,**  
**Sped thus on Troy its destined ill,**  
**Well named, at once, the Bride and Bane;**  
**And loud rang out the bridal strain;**  
**But they to whom that song befel**  
**Did turn anon to tears again;**  
**Zeus tarries, but avenges still**  
**The husband’s wrong, the household’s stain\!**  
**He, the hearth’s lord, brooks not to see**  
**Its outraged hospitality.**  
**Even now, and in far other tone,**  
**Troy chants her dirge of mighty moan,**  
***Woe upon Paris, woe and hate\!***  
***Who wooed his country’s doom for mate — ***  
**This is the burthen of the groan,**  
**Wherewith she wails disconsolate**  
**The blood so many of her own**  
**Have poured in vain, to fend her fate;**  
**Troy\! thou hast fed and freed to roam**  
**A lion-cub within thy home\!**  
**A suckling creature, newly ta’en**  
**From mother’s teat, still fully fain**  
**Of nursing care; and oft caressed,**  
**Within the arms, upon the breast,**  
**Even as an infant, has it lain;**  
**Or fawns and licks, by hunger pressed,**  
**The hand that will assuage its pain;**  
**In life’s young dawn, a well-loved guest,**  
**A fondling for the children’s play,**  
**A joy unto the old and gray.**  
**But waxing time and growth betrays**  
**The blood-thirst of the lion-race,**  
**And, for the house’s fostering care,**  
**Unbidden all, it revels there,**  
**And bloody recompense repays — **  
**Rent flesh of kine its talons tare:**  
**A mighty beast, that slays and slays,**  
**And mars with blood the household fair,

 

A God-sent pest invincible,**  
**A minister of fate and hell.**  
**Even so to Ilion’s city came by stealth**  
**A spirit as of windless seas and skies,**  
**A gentle phantom-form of joy and wealth,**  
**With love’s soft arrows speeding from it eyes — **  
**Love’s rose, whose thorn doth pierce the soul in subtle wise.**  
**Ah, well-a-day\! the bitter bridal-bed,**  
**When the fair mischief lay by Paris’ side\!**  
**What curse on palace and on people sped**  
**With her, the Fury sent on Priam’s pride,**  
**By angered Zeus\! what tears of many a widowed bride\!**  
**Long, long ago to mortals this was told,**  
**How sweet security and blissful state**  
**Have curses for their children — so men hold — **  
**And for the man of all — too prosperous fate**  
**Springs from a bitter seed some woe insatiate.**  
**Alone, alone, I deem far otherwise;**  
**Not bliss nor wealth it is, but impious deed,**  
**From which that after-growth of ill doth rise\!**  
**Woe springs from wrong, the plant is like the seed — **  
**While Right, in honour’s house, doth its own likeness breed.**  
**Some past impiety, some gray old crime,**  
**Breeds the young curse, that wantons in our ill,**  
**Early or late, when haps th’ appointed time — **  
**And out of light brings power of darkness still,**  
**A master-fiend, a foe, unseen, invincible;**  
**A pride accursed, that broods upon the race**  
**And home in which dark Ate holds her sway — **  
**Sin’s child and Woe’s, that wears its parent’s face;**  
**While Right in smoky cribs shines clear as day,**  
**And decks with weal his life, who walks the righteous way.**  
**From gilded halls that hands polluted raise,**  
**Right turns away with proud averted eyes,**  
**And of the wealth men stamp amiss with praise,**  
**Heedless, to poorer, holier temples hies,**  
**And to Fate’s goal guides all, in its appointed wise.**  
**Hail to thee, chief of Atreus’ race,**  
**Returning proud from Troy subdued\!**  
**How shall I greet thy conquering face?**  
**How nor a fulsome praise obtrude,**  
**Nor stint the meed of gratitude?**  
**For mortal men who fall to ill**  
**Take little heed of open truth,**  
**But seek unto its semblance still:**  
**The show of weeping and of ruth**  
**To the forlorn will all men pay,**  
**But, of the grief their eyes display,**  
**Nought to the heart doth pierce its way.**  
**And, with the joyous, they beguile**  
**Their lips unto a feigned smile,**  
**And force a joy, unfelt the while;**  
**But he who as a shepherd wise**  
**Doth know his flock, can ne’er misread**  
**Truth in the falsehood of his eyes,**  
**Who veils beneath a kindly guise**  
**A lukewarm love in deed.**  
**And thou, our leader — when of yore**  
**Thou badest Greece go forth to war**  
**For Helen’s sake — I dare avow**  
**That then I held thee not as now;**  
**That to my vision thou didst seem**  
**Dyed in the hues of disesteem.**  
**I held thee for a pilot ill,**  
**And reckless, of thy proper will,**  
**Endowing others doomed to die**  
**With vain and forced audacity\!**  
**Now from my heart, ungrudgingly,**  
**To those that wrought, this word be said — **  
***Well fall the labour ye have sped — ***  
**Let time and search, O king, declare**  
**What men within thy city’s bound**  
**Were loyal to the kingdom’s care,**  
**And who were faithless found.  \[*Enter Agamemnon in a chariot, accompanied by Cassandra. He speaks without descending.*

 

AGAMEMNON**  
**First, as is meet, a king’s All-hail be said**  
**To Argos, and the gods that guard the land — **  
**Gods who with me availed to speed us home,**  
**With me availed to wring from Priam’s town**  
**The due of justice. In the court of heaven**  
**The gods in conclave sat and judged the cause,**  
**Not from a pleader’s tongue, and at the close,**  
**Unanimous into the urn of doom**  
**This sentence gave, *On Ilion and her men,***  
***Death:* and where hope drew nigh to pardon’s urn**  
**No hand there was to cast a vote therein.**  
**And still the smoke of fallen Ilion**  
**Rises in sight of all men, and the flame**  
**Of Atè’s hecatomb is living yet,**  
**And where the towers in dusty ashes sink,**  
**Rise the rich fumes of pomp and wealth consumed.**  
**For this must all men pay unto the gods**  
**The meed of mindful hearts and gratitude:**  
**For by our hands the meshes of revenge**  
**Closed on the prey, and for one woman’s sake**  
**Troy trodden by the Argive monster lies — **  
**The foal, the shielded band that leapt the wall,**  
**What time with autumn sank the Pleiades.**  
**Yea, o’er the fencing wall a lion sprang**  
**Ravening, and lapped his fill of blood of kings.**  
**Such prelude spoken to the gods in full,**  
**To you I turn, and to the hidden thing**  
**Whereof ye spake but now: and in that thought**  
**I am as you, and what ye say, say I.**  
**For few are they who have such inborn grace,**  
**As to look up with love, and envy not,**  
**When stands another on the height of weal.**  
**Deep on his heart, whom jealousy hath seized,**  
**Her poison lurking doth enhance his load;**  
**For now beneath his proper woes he chafes,**  
**And sighs withal to see another’s weal.**  
**I speak not idly, but from knowledge sure — **  
**There be who vaunt an utter loyalty,**  
**That is but as the ghost of friendship dead,**  
**A shadow in a glass, of faith gone by.**  
**One only — he who went reluctant forth**  
**Across the seas with me — Odysseus — he**  
**Was loyal unto me with strength and will,**  
**A trusty trace-horse bound unto my car.**  
**Thus — be he yet beneath the light of day,**  
**Or dead, as well I fear — I speak his praise.**  
**Lastly, whate’er be due to men or gods,**  
**With joint debate, in public council held,**  
**We will decide, and warily contrive**  
**That all which now is well may so abide:**  
**For that which haply needs the healer’s art,**  
**That will we medicine, discerning well**  
**If cautery or knife befit the time.**  
**Now, to my palace and the shrines of home,**  
**I will pass in, and greet you first and fair,**  
**Ye gods, who bade me forth, and home again — **  
**And long may Victory tarry in my train\!  \[*Enter Clytemnestra, followed by maidens bearing purple robes.*

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Old men of Argos, lieges of our realm,**  
**Shame shall not bid me shrink lest ye should see**  
**The love I bear my lord. Such blushing fear**  
**Dies at the last from hearts of humankind.**  
**From mine own soul and from no alien lips,**  
**I know and will reveal the life I bore,**  
**Reluctant, through the lingering livelong years,**  
**The while my lord beleaguered Ilion’s wall.**  
**First, that a wife sat sundered from her lord,**  
**In widowed solitude, was utter woe — **  
**And woe, to hear how rumour’s many tongues**  
**All boded evil-woe, when he who came**  
**And he who followed spake of ill on ill,**  
**Keening *Lost, lost, all lost\!* thro’ hall and bower.**  
**Had this my husband met so many wounds,**  
**As by a thousand channels rumour told,**  
**No network e’er was full of holes as he.**  
**Had he been slain, as oft as tidings came**  
**That he was dead, he well might boast him now**  
**A second Geryon of triple frame,**  
**With triple robe of earth above him laid — **  
**For that below, no matter — triply dead,**  
**Dead by one death for every form he bore.**  
**And thus distraught by news of wrath and woe,**  
**Oft for self-slaughter had I slung the noose,**  
**But others wrenched it from my neck away.**  
**Hence haps it that Orestes, thine and mine,**  
**The pledge and symbol of our wedded troth,**  
**Stands not beside us now, as he should stand.**  
**Nor marvel thou at this: he dwells with one**  
**Who guards him loyally; ’tis Phocis’ king,**  
**Strophius, who warned me erst, *Bethink thee, queen,***  
***What woes of doubtful issue well may fall\!***  
***Thy lord in daily jeopardy at Troy,***  
***While here a populace uncurbed may cry,***  
***“Down with the council, down\!” bethink thee too,***  
***’Tis the world’s way to set a harder heel***  
***On fallen power.***  
**For thy child’s absence then**  
**Such mine excuse, no wily afterthought.**  
**For me, long since the gushing fount of tears**  
**Is wept away; no drop is left to shed.**  
**Dim are the eyes that ever watched till dawn,**  
**Weeping, the bale-fires, piled for thy return,**  
**Night after night unkindled. If I slept,**  
**Each sound — the tiny humming of a gnat,**  
**Roused me again, again, from fitful dreams**  
**Wherein I felt thee smitten, saw thee slain,**  
**Thrice for each moment of mine hour of sleep.**  
**All this I bore, and now, released from woe,**  
**A hail my lord as watch-dog of a fold,**  
**As saving stay-rope of a storm-tossed ship,**  
**As column stout that holds the roof aloft,**  
**As only child unto a sire bereaved,**  
**As land beheld, past hope, by crews forlorn,**  
**As sunshine fair when tempest’s wrath is past,**  
**As gushing spring to thirsty wayfarer.**  
**So sweet it is to ‘scape the press of pain.**  
**With such salute I bid my husband hail\!**  
**Nor heaven be wroth therewith\! for long and hard**  
**I bore that ire of old.**  
**Sweet lord, step forth,**  
**Step from thy car, I pray — nay, not on earth**  
**Plant the proud foot, O king, that trod down Troy\!**  
**Women\! why tarry ye, whose task it is**  
**To spread your monarch’s path with tapestry?**  
**Swift, swift, with purple strew his passage fair,**  
**That justice lead him to a home, at last,**  
**He scarcely looked to see.**  
**For what remains,**  
**Zeal unsubdued by sleep shall nerve my hand**  
**To work as right and as the gods command.

 

AGAMEMNON**  
**Daughter of Leda, watcher o’er my home,**  
**Thy greeting well befits mine absence long,**  
**For late and hardly has it reached its end.**  
**Know that the praise which honour bids us crave,**  
**Must come from others’ lips, not from our own:**  
**See too that not in fashion feminine**  
**Thou make a warrior’s pathway delicate;**  
**Not unto me, as to some Eastern lord,**  
**Bowing thyself to earth, make homage loud.**  
**Strew not this purple that shall make each step**  
**An arrogance; such pomp beseems the gods,**  
**Not me. A mortal man to set his foot**  
**On these rich dyes? I hold such pride in fear,**  
**And bid thee honour me as man, not god.**  
**Fear not — such footcloths and all gauds apart,**  
**Loud from the trump of Fame my name is blown;**  
**Best gift of heaven it is, in glory’s hour,**  
**To think thereon with soberness: and thou — **  
**Bethink thee of the adage, *Call none blest***  
***Till peaceful death have crowned a life of weal.***  
**’Tis said: I fain would fare unvexed by fear.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Nay, but unsay it — thwart not thou my will

 

AGAMEMNON**  
**Know, I have said, and will not mar my word.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Was it fear made this meekness to the gods?

 

AGAMEMNON**  
**If cause be cause, ’tis mine for this resolve.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**What, think’st thou, in thy place had Priam done?

 

AGAMEMNON**  
**He surely would have walked on broidered robes.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Then fear not thou the voice of human blame.

 

AGAMEMNON**  
**Yet mighty is the murmur of a crowd.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Shrink not from envy, appanage of bliss.

 

AGAMEMNON**  
**War is not woman’s part, nor war of words.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Yet happy victors well may yield therein.

 

AGAMEMNON**  
**Dost crave for triumph in this petty strife?

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Yield; of thy grace permit me to prevail\!

 

AGAMEMNON**  
**Then, if thou wilt, let some one stoop to loose**  
**Swiftly these sandals, slaves beneath my foot:**  
**And stepping thus upon the sea’s rich dye,**  
**I pray, *Let none among the gods look down***  
***With jealous eye on me* — reluctant all,**  
**To trample thus and mar a thing of price,**  
**Wasting the wealth of garments silver-worth.**  
**Enough hereof: and, for the stranger maid,**  
**Lead her within, but gently: God on high**  
**Looks graciously on him whom triumph’s hour**  
**Has made not pitiless. None willingly**  
**Wear the slave’s yoke — and she, the prize and flower**  
**Of all we won, comes hither in my train,**  
**Gift of the army to its chief and lord.**  
** — Now, since in this my will bows down to thine,**  
**I will pass in on purples to my home.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA

A Sea there is — and who shall stay its springs?**  
**And deep within its breast, a mighty store,**  
**Precious as silver, of the purple dye,**  
**Whereby the dipped robe doth its tint renew.**  
**Enough of such, O king, within thy halls**  
**There lies, a store that cannot fail; but I — **  
**I would have gladly vowed unto the gods**  
**Cost of a thousand garments trodden thus**  
**\(Had once the oracle such gift required\),**  
**Contriving ransom for thy life preserved.**  
**For while the stock is firm the foliage climbs,**  
**Spreading a shade, what time the dog-star glows;**  
**And thou, returning to thine hearth and home,**  
**Art as a genial warmth in winter hours,**  
**Or as a coolness, when the lord of heaven**  
**Mellows the juice within the bitter grape.**  
**Such boons and more doth bring into a home**  
**The present footstep of its proper lord.**  
**Zeus, Zeus, Fulfilment’s lord\! my vows fulfil,**  
**And whatsoe’er it be, work forth thy will\!  \[*Exeunt all but Cassandra and the Chorus.*

 

CHORUS**  
**  Wherefore for ever on the wings of fear**  
**Hovers a vision drear**  
**Before my boding heart? a strain,**  
**Unbidden and unwelcome, thrills mine ear,**  
**Oracular of pain.**  
**Not as of old upon my bosom’s throne**  
**Sits Confidence, to spurn**  
**Such fears, like dreams we know not to discern.**  
**Old, old and gray long since the time has grown,**  
**Which saw the linked cables moor**  
**The fleet, when erst it came to Ilion’s sandy shore;**  
**And now mine eyes and not another’s see**  
**Their safe return.**  
**Yet none the less in me**  
**The inner spirit sings a boding song,**  
**Self-prompted, sings the Furies’ strain — **  
**And seeks, and seeks in vain,**  
**To hope and to be strong\!**  
**Ah\! to some end of Fate, unseen, unguessed,**  
**Are these wild throbbings of my heart and breast — **  
**Yea, of some doom they tell — **  
**Each pulse, a knell.**  
**Lief, lief I were, that all**  
**To unfulfilment’s hidden realm might fall.**  
**Too far, too far our mortal spirits strive,**  
**Grasping at utter weal, unsatisfied — **  
**Till the fell curse, that dwelleth hard beside,**  
**Thrust down the sundering wall. Too fair they blow,**  
**The gales that waft our bark on Fortune’s tide\!**  
**Swiftly we sail, the sooner all to drive**  
**Upon the hidden rock, the reef of woe.**  
**Then if the hand of caution warily**  
**Sling forth into the sea**  
**Part of the freight, lest all should sink below,**  
**From the deep death it saves the bark: even so,**  
**Doom-laden though it be, once more may rise**  
**His household, who is timely wise.**  
**How oft the famine-stricken field**  
**Is saved by God’s large gift, the new year’s yield\!**  
**But blood of man once spilled,**  
**Once at his feet shed forth, and darkening the plain, — **  
**Nor chant nor charm can call it back again.**  
**So Zeus hath willed:**  
**Else had he spared the leech Asclepius, skilled**  
**To bring man from the dead: the hand divine**  
**Did smite himself with death — a warning and a sign.**  
**Ah me\! if Fate, ordained of old,**  
**Held not the will of gods constrained, controlled,**  
**Helpless to us-ward, and apart — **  
**Swifter than speech my heart**  
**Had poured its presage out\!**  
**Now, fretting, chafing in the dark of doubt,**  
**’Tis hopeless to unfold**  
**Truth, from fear’s tangled skein; and, yearning to proclaim**  
**Its thought, my soul is prophecy and flame.**  
**Re-enter CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Get thee within, thou too, Cassandra, go\!**  
**For Zeus to thee in gracious mercy grants**  
**To share the sprinklings of the lustral bowl,**  
**Beside the altar of his guardianship,**  
**Slave among many slaves. What, haughty still?**  
**Step from the car; Alcmena’s son, ’tis said,**  
**Was sold perforce and bore the yoke of old.**  
**Ay, hard it is, but, if such fate befal,**  
**’Tis a fair chance to serve within a home**  
**Of ancient wealth and power. An upstart lord,**  
**To whom wealth’s harvest came beyond his hope,**  
**Is as a lion to his slaves, in all**  
**Exceeding fierce, immoderate in sway.**  
**Pass in: thou hearest what our ways will be.

 

CHORUS**  
**Clear unto thee, O maid, is her command,**  
**But thou — within the toils of Fate thou art — **  
**If such thy will, I urge thee to obey;**  
**Yet I misdoubt thou dost nor hear nor heed.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**I wot — unless like swallows she doth use**  
**Some strange barbarian tongue from oversea — **  
**My words must speak persuasion to her soul.

 

CHORUS**  
**Obey: there is no gentler way than this.**  
**Step from the car’s high seat and follow her.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Truce to this bootless waiting here without\!**  
**I will not stay: beside the central shrine**  
**The victims stand, prepared for knife and fire — **  
**Offerings from hearts beyond all hope made glad.**  
**Thou — if thou reckest aught of my command,**  
**‘Twere well done soon: but if thy sense be shut**  
**From these my words, let thy barbarian hand**  
**Fulfil by gesture the default of speech.

 

CHORUS**  
**No native is she, thus to read thy words**  
**Unaided: like some wild thing of the wood,**  
**New-trapped, behold\! she shrinks and glares on thee.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**’Tis madness and the rule of mind distraught,**  
**Since she beheld her city sink in fire,**  
**And hither comes, nor brooks the bit, until**  
**In foam and blood her wrath be champed away.**  
**See ye to her; unqueenly ’tis for me,**  
**Unheeded thus to cast away my words.  \[*Exit Clytemnestra.*

 

CHORUS**  
**But with me pity sits in anger’s place**  
**Poor maiden, come thou from the car; no way**  
**There is but this — take up thy servitude.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Woe, woe, alas\! Earth, Mother Earth\! and thou**  
**Apollo, Apollo\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Peace\! shriek not to the bright prophetic god,**  
**Who will not brook the suppliance of woe.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Woe, woe, alas\! Earth, Mother Earth\! and thou**  
**Apollo, Apollo\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Hark, with wild curse she calls anew on him,**  
**Who stands far off and loathes the voice of wail.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Apollo, Apollo\!**  
**God of all ways, but only Death’s to me,**  
**Once and again, O thou, Destroyer named,**  
**thou hast destroyed me, thou, my love of old\!

 

CHORUS**  
**She grows presageful of her woes to come,**  
**Slave tho’ she be, instinct with prophecy.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Apollo, Apollo\!**  
**God of all ways, but only Death’s to me,**  
**O thou Apollo, thou Destroyer named\!**  
**What way hast led me, to what evil home?

 

CHORUS**  
**Know’st thou it not? The home of Atreus’ race:**  
**Take these my words for sooth and ask no more.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Home cursed of God\! Bear witness unto me,**  
**Ye visioned woes within — **  
**The blood-stained hands of them that smite their kin — **  
**The strangling noose, and, spattered o’er**  
**With human blood, the reeking floor\!

 

CHORUS**  
**How like a sleuth-hound questing on the track,**  
**Keen-scented unto blood and death she hies\!

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Ah\! can the ghostly guidance fail,**  
**Whereby my prophet-soul is onwards led?**  
**Look\! for their flesh the spectre-children wail,**  
**Their sodden limbs on which their father fed\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Long since we knew of thy prophetic fame, — **  
**But for those deeds we seek no prophet’s tongue.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**God\! ’tis another crime — **  
**Worse than the storied woe of olden time,**  
**Cureless, abhorred, that one is plotting here — **  
**A shaming death, for those that should be dear\!**  
**Alas\! and far away, in foreign land,**  
**He that should help doth stand\!

 

CHORUS**  
**I knew th’ old tales the city rings withal — **  
**But now thy speech is dark, beyond my ken.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**O wretch, O purpose fell\!**  
**Thou for thy wedded lord**  
**The cleansing wave hast poured — **  
**A treacherous welcome\!**  
**           How the sequel tell?**  
**Too soon ‘twill come, too soon, for now, even now,**  
**She smites him, blow on blow\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Riddles beyond my rede — I peer in vain**  
**Thro’ the dim films that screen the prophecy.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**  God\! a new sight\! a net, a snare off hell,**  
**Set by her hand — herself a snare more fell\!**  
**A wedded wife, she slays her lord,**  
**Helped by another hand\!**  
**             Ye powers, whose hate**  
**Of Atreus’ home no blood can satiate,**  
**Raise the wild cry above the sacrifice abhorred\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Why biddest thou some fiend, I know not whom,**  
**Shriek o’er the house? Thine is no cheering word.**  
**Back to my heart in frozen fear I feel**  
**My waning life-blood run — **  
**The blood that round the wounding steel**  
**Ebbs slow, as sinks life’s parting sun — **  
**Swift, swift and sure, some woe comes pressing on\!

 

CASSANDRA**  
**    Away, away — keep him away — **  
**The monarch of the herd, the pasture’s pride,**  
**Far from his mate\! In treach’rous wrath,**  
**Muffling his swarthy horns, with secret scathe**  
**She gores his fenceless side\!**  
**Hark\! in the brimming bath,**  
**The heavy plash — the dying cry — **  
**Hark — in the laver — hark, he falls by treachery\!

 

CHORUS**  
**I read amiss dark sayings such as thine,**  
**Yet something warns me that they tell of ill.**  
**O dark prophetic speech,**  
**Ill tidings dost thou teach**  
**Ever, to mortals here below\!**  
**Ever some tale of awe and woe**  
**Thro’ all thy windings manifold**  
**Do we unriddle and unfold\!

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Ah well-a-day\! the cup of agony,**  
**Whereof I chant, foams with a draught for me.**  
**Ah lord, ah leader, thou hast led me here — **  
**Was’t but to die with thee whose doom is near?

 

CHORUS**  
**  Distraught thou art, divinely stirred,**  
**And wailest for thyself a tuneless lay,**  
**As piteous as the ceaseless tale**  
**Wherewith the brown melodious bird**  
**Doth ever Itys\! Itys\! wail,**  
**Deep-bowered in sorrow, all its little lifetime’s day\!

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Ah for thy fate, O shrill-voiced nightingale\!**  
**Some solace for thy woes did heaven afford,**  
**Clothed thee with soft brown plumes, and life apart from wail — **  
**But for my death is edged the double-biting sword\!

 

CHORUS**  
**What pangs are these, what fruitless pain,**  
**Sent on thee from on high?**  
**Thou chantest terror’s frantic strain,**  
**Yet in shrill measured melody.**  
**How thus unerring canst thou sweep along**  
**The prophet’s path of boding song?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**  Woe, Paris, woe on thee\! thy bridal joy**  
**Was death and fire upon thy race and Troy\!**  
**And woe for thee, Scamander’s flood\!**  
**Beside thy banks, O river fair,**  
**I grew in tender nursing care**  
**From childhood unto maidenhood\!**  
**Now not by thine, but by Cocytus’ stream**  
**And Acheron’s banks shall ring my boding scream.

 

CHORUS**  
**    Too plain is all, too plain\!**  
**A child might read aright thy fateful strain.**  
**Deep in my heart their piercing fang**  
**Terror and sorrow set, the while I heard**  
**That piteous, low, tender word,**  
**Yet to mine ear and heart a crushing pang.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Woe for my city, woe for Ilion’s fall\!**  
**Father, how oft with sanguine stain**  
**Streamed on thine altar-stone the blood of cattle, slain**  
**That heaven might guard our wall\!**  
**But all was shed in vain.**  
**Low lie the shattered towers whereas they fell,**  
**And I — ah burning heart\! — shall soon lie low as well.

 

CHORUS**  
**    Of sorrow is thy song, of sorrow still\!**  
**Alas, what power of ill**  
**Sits heavy on thy heart and bids thee tell**  
**In tears of perfect moan thy deadly tale?**  
**Some woe — I know not what — must close thy piteous wail.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**List\! for no more the presage of my soul,**  
**Bride-like, shall peer from its secluding veil;**  
**But as the morning wind blows clear the east,**  
**More bright shall blow the wind of prophecy,**  
**And as against the low bright line of dawn**  
**Heaves high and higher yet the rolling wave,**  
**So in the clearing skies of prescience**  
**Dawns on my soul a further, deadlier woe,**  
**And I will speak, but in dark speech no more.**  
**Bear witness, ye, and follow at my side — **  
**I scent the trail of blood, shed long ago.**  
**Within this house a choir abidingly**  
**Chants in harsh unison the chant of ill;**  
**Yea, and they drink, for more enhardened joy,**  
**Man’s blood for wine, and revel in the halls,**  
**Departing never, Furies of the home.**  
**They sit within, they chant the primal curse,**  
**Each spitting hatred on that crime of old,**  
**The brother’s couch, the love incestuous**  
**That brought forth hatred to the ravisher.**  
**Say, is my speech or wild and erring now,**  
**Or doth its arrow cleave the mark indeed?**  
**They called me once, *The prophetess of lies,***  
***The wandering hag, the pest of every door — ***  
**Attest ye now, *She knows in very sooth***  
***The house’s curse, the storied infamy.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Yet how should oath — how loyally soe’er**  
**I swear it — aught avail thee? In good sooth,**  
**My wonder meets thy claim: I stand amazed**  
**That thou, a maiden born beyond the seas,**  
**Dost as a native know and tell aright**  
**Tales of a city of an alien tongue.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**That is my power — a boon Apollo gave.

 

CHORUS**  
**God though he were, yearning for mortal maid?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Ay\! what seemed shame of old is shame no more.

 

CHORUS**  
**Such finer sense suits not with slavery.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**He strove to win me, panting for my love.

 

CHORUS**  
**Came ye by compact unto bridal joys?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Nay — for I plighted troth, then foiled the god.

 

CHORUS**  
**Wert thou already dowered with prescience?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Yea — prophetess to Troy of all her doom.

 

CHORUS**  
**How left thee then Apollo’s wrath unscathed?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**I, false to him, seemed prophet false to all.

 

CHORUS**  
**Not so — to us at least thy words seem sooth.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Woe for me, woe\! Again the agony — **  
**Dread pain that sees the future all too well**  
**With ghastly preludes whirls and racks my soul.**  
**Behold ye — yonder on the palace roof**  
**The spectre-children sitting — look, such things**  
**As dreams are made on, phantoms as of babes,**  
**Horrible shadows, that a kinsman’s hand**  
**Hath marked with murder, and their arms as full — **  
**A rueful burden — see, they hold them up,**  
**The entrails upon which their father fed\!**  
**For this, for this, I say there plots revenge**  
**A coward lion, couching in the lair — **  
**Guarding the gate against my master’s foot — **  
**My master-mine — I bear the slave’s yoke now,**  
**And he, the lord of ships, who trod down Troy,**  
**Knows not the fawning treachery of tongue**  
**Of this thing false and dog-like — how her speech**  
**Glazes and sleeks her purpose, till she win**  
**By ill fate’s favour the desired chance,**  
**Moving like Ate to a secret end.**  
**O aweless soul\! the woman slays her lord — **  
**Woman? what loathsome monster of the earth**  
**Were fit comparison? The double snake — **  
**Or Scylla, where she dwells, the seaman’s bane,**  
**Girt round about with rocks? some hag of hell,**  
**Raving a truceless curse upon her kin?**  
**Hark — even now she cries exultingly**  
**The vengeful cry that tells of battle turned — **  
**How fain, forsooth, to greet her chief restored\!**  
**Nay, then, believe me not: what skills belief**  
**Or disbelief? Fate works its will — and thou**  
**Wilt see and say in ruth, *Her tale was true.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Ah— ’tis Thyestes’ feast on kindred flesh — **  
**I guess her meaning and with horror thrill,**  
**Hearing no shadow’d hint of th’ o’er — true tale,**  
**But its full hatefulness: yet, for the rest,**  
**Far from the track I roam, and know no more.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**’Tis Agamemnon’s doom thou shalt behold.

 

CHORUS**  
**Peace, hapless woman, to thy boding words\!

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Far from my speech stands he who sains and saves.

 

CHORUS**  
**Ay — were such doom at hand — which God forbid\!

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Thou prayest idly — these move swift to slay.

 

CHORUS**  
**What man prepares a deed of such despite?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Fool\! thus to read amiss mine oracles.

 

CHORUS**  
**Deviser and device are dark to me.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Dark\! all too well I speak the Grecian tongue.

 

CHORUS**  
**Ay — but in thine, as in Apollo’s strains,**  
**Familiar is the tongue, but dark the thought.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Ah ah the fire\! it waxes, nears me now — **  
**Woe, woe for me, Apollo of the dawn\!**  
**Lo, how the woman-thing, the lioness**  
**Couched with the wolf — her noble mate afar — **  
**Will slay me, slave forlorn\! Yea, like some witch,**  
**She drugs the cup of wrath, that slays her lord**  
**With double death — his recompense for me\!**  
**Ay, ’tis for me, the prey he bore from Troy,**  
**That she hath sworn his death, and edged the steel\!**  
**Ye wands, ye wreaths that cling around my neck,**  
**Ye showed me prophetess yet scorned of all — **  
**I stamp you into death, or e’er I die — **  
**Down, to destruction\!**  
**         Thus I stand revenged — **  
**Go, crown some other with a prophet’s woe.**  
**Look\! it is he, it is Apollo’s self**  
**Rending from me the prophet-robe he gave.**  
**God\! while I wore it yet, thou saw’st me mocked**  
**There at my home by each malicious mouth — **  
**To all and each, an undivided scorn.**  
**The name alike and fate of witch and cheat — **  
**Woe, poverty, and famine — all I bore;**  
**And at this last the god hath brought me here**  
**Into death’s toils, and what his love had made,**  
**His hate unmakes me now: and I shall stand**  
**Not now before the altar of my home,**  
**But me a slaughter-house and block of blood**  
**Shall see hewn down, a reeking sacrifice.**  
**Yet shall the gods have heed of me who die,**  
**For by their will shall one requite my doom.**  
**He, to avenge his father’s blood outpoured,**  
**Shall smite and slay with matricidal hand.**  
**Ay, he shall come — tho’ far away he roam,**  
**A banished wanderer in a stranger’s land — **  
**To crown his kindred’s edifice of ille**  
**Called home to vengeance by his father’s fall:**  
**Thus have the high gods sworn, and shall fulfil.**  
**And now why mourn I, tarrying on earth,**  
**Since first mine Ilion has found its fate**  
**And I beheld, and those who won the wall**  
**Pass to such issue as the gods ordain?**  
**I too will pass and like them dare to die\!  \[*Turns and looks upon the palace door.***  
**Portal of Hades, thus I bid thee hail\!**  
**Grant me one boon — a swift and mortal stroke,**  
**That all unwrong by pain, with ebbing blood**  
**Shed forth in quiet death, I close mine eyes.

 

CHORUS**  
**Maid of mysterious woes, mysterious lore,**  
**Long was thy prophecy: but if aright**  
**Thou readest all thy fate, how, thus unscared,**  
**Dost thou approach the altar of thy doom,**  
**As fronts the knife some victim, heaven-controlled?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Friends, there is no avoidance in delay.

 

CHORUS**  
**Yet who delays the longest, his the gain.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**The day is come — flight were small gain to me\!

 

CHORUS**  
**O brave endurance of a soul resolved\!

 

CASSANDRA**  
**That were ill praise, for those of happier doom.

 

CHORUS**  
**All fame is happy, even famous death.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Ah sire, ah brethren, famous once were ye\!  \[*She moves to enter the house, then starts back.*

 

CHORUS**  
**What fear is this that scares thee from the house?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Pah\!

 

CHORUS**  
**What is this cry? some dark despair of soul?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Pah\! the house fumes with stench and spilth of blood.

 

CHORUS**  
**How? ’tis the smell of household offerings.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**’Tis rank as charnel-scent from open graves.

 

CHORUS**  
**Thou canst not mean this scented Syrian nard?

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Nay, let me pass within to cry aloud**  
**The monarch’s fate and mine — enough of life.**  
**Ah friends\!**  
**Bear to me witness, since I fall in death,**  
**That not as birds that shun the bush and scream**  
**I moan in idle terror. This attest**  
**When for my death’s revenge another dies,**  
**A woman for a woman, and a man**  
**Falls, for a man ill-wedded to his curse.**  
**Grant me this boon — the last before I die.

 

CHORUS**  
**Brave to the last\! I mourn thy doom foreseen.

 

CASSANDRA**  
**Once more one utterance, but not of wail,**  
**Though for my death — and then I speak no more.**  
**Sun\! thou whose beam I shall not see again,**  
**To thee I cry, Let those whom vengeance calls**  
**To slay their kindred’s slayers, quit withal**  
**The death of me, the slave, the fenceless prey.**  
**Ah state of mortal man\! in time of weal,**  
**A line, a shadow\! and if ill fate fall,**  
**One wet sponge-sweep wipes all our trace away — **  
**And this I deem less piteous, of the twain.  \[*Exit into the palace.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Too true it is\! our mortal state**  
**With bliss is never satiate,**  
**And none, before the palace high**  
**And stately of prosperity,**  
**Cries to us with a voice of fear,**  
***Away\! ’tis ill to enter here\!***  
**Lo\! this our lord hath trodden down,**  
**By grace of heaven, old Priam’s town,**  
**And praised as god he stands once more**  
**On Argos’ shore\!**  
**Yet now — if blood shed long ago**  
**Cries out that other blood shall flow — **  
**His life-blood, his, to pay again**  
**The stern requital of the slain — **  
**Peace to that braggart’s vaunting vain,**  
**Who, having heard the chieftain’s tale,**  
**Yet boasts of bliss untouched by bale\!  \[*A loud cry from within.*

 

VOICE OF AGAMEMNON

O I am sped — a deep, a mortal blow.

 

CHORUS**  
**Listen, listen\! who is screaming as in mortal agony?

 

VOICE OF AGAMEMNON**  
**O\! O\! again, another, another blow\!

 

CHORUS**  
**The bloody act is over — I have heard the monarch’s cry — **  
**Let us swiftly take some counsel, lest we too be doomed to die.

 

ONE OF THE CHORUS**  
**’Tis best, I judge, aloud for aid to call,**  
**“Ho\! loyal Argives\! to the palace, all\!”

 

ANOTHER**  
**Better, I deem, ourselves to bear the aid,**  
**And drag the deed to light, while drips the blade.

 

ANOTHER**  
**Such will is mine, and what thou say’st I say:**  
**Swiftly to act\! the time brooks no delay.

 

ANOTHER**  
**Ay, for ’tis plain, this prelude of their song**  
**Foretells its close in tyranny and wrong.

 

ANOTHER**  
**Behold, we tarry — but thy name, Delay,**  
**They spurn, and press with sleepless hand to slay.

 

ANOTHER**  
**I know not what ‘twere well to counsel now — **  
**Who wills to act, ’tis his to counsel how.

 

ANOTHER**  
**Thy doubt is mine: for when a man is slain,**  
**I have no words to bring his life again.

 

ANOTHER**  
**What? e’en for life’s sake, bow us to obey**  
**These house-defilers and their tyrant sway?

 

ANOTHER**  
**Unmanly doom\! ‘twere better far to die — **  
**Death is a gentler lord than tyranny.

 

ANOTHER**  
**Think well — must cry or sign of woe or pain**  
**Fix our conclusion that the chief is slain?

 

ANOTHER**  
**Such talk befits us when the deed we see — **  
**Conjecture dwells afar from certainty.

 

LEADER OF THE CHORUS**  
**I read one will from many a diverse word,**  
**To know aright, how stands it with our lord\!  \[*The scene opens, disclosing Clytemnestra, who comes forward. The body of Agamemnon lies, muffled in a long robe, within a silver-sided laver; the corpse of Cassandra is laid beside him.*

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Ho, ye who heard me speak so long and oft**  
**The glozing word that led me to my will — **  
**Hear how I shrink not to unsay it all\!**  
**How else should one who willeth to requite**  
**Evil for evil to an enemy**  
**Disguised as friend, weave the mesh straitly round him,**  
**Not to be overleaped, a net of doom?**  
**This is the sum and issue of old strife,**  
**Of me deep-pondered and at length fulfilled.**  
**All is avowed, and as I smote I stand**  
**With foot set firm upon a finished thing\!**  
**I turn not to denial: thus I wrought**  
**So that he could nor flee nor ward his doom.**  
**Even as the trammel hems the scaly shoal,**  
**I trapped him with inextricable toils,**  
**The ill abundance of a baffling robe;**  
**Then smote him, once, again — and at each wound**  
**He cried aloud, then as in death relaxed**  
**Each limb and sank to earth; and as he lay,**  
**Once more I smote him, with the last third blow,**  
**Sacred to Hades, saviour of the dead.**  
**And thus he fell, and as he passed away,**  
**Spirit with body chafed; each dying breath**  
**Flung from his breast swift bubbling jets of gore,**  
**And the dark sprinklings of the rain of blood**  
**Fell upon me; and I was fain to feel**  
**That dew — not sweeter is the rain of heaven**  
**To cornland, when the green sheath teems with grain.**  
**Elders of Argos — since the thing stands so,**  
**I bid you to rejoice, if such your will:**  
**Rejoice or not, I vaunt and praise the deed,**  
**And well I ween, if seemly it could be,**  
**‘Twere not ill done to pour libations here,**  
**Justly — ay, more than justly — on his corpse**  
**Who filled his home with curses as with wine,**  
**And thus returned to drain the cup he filled.

 

CHORUS**  
**I marvel at thy tongue’s audacity,**  
**To vaunt thus loudly o’er a husband slain.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Ye hold me as a woman, weak of will,**  
**And strive to sway me: but my heart is stout,**  
**Nor fears to speak its uttermost to you,**  
**Albeit ye know its message. Praise or blame,**  
**Even as ye list, — I reck not of your words.**  
**Lo\! at my feet lies Agamemnon slain,**  
**My husband once — and him this hand of mine,**  
**A right contriver, fashioned for his death.**  
**Behold the deed\!

 

CHORUS**  
**  Woman, what deadly birth,**  
**What venomed essence of the earth**  
**Or dark distilment of the wave,**  
**To thee such passion gave,**  
**Nerving thine hand**  
**To set upon thy brow this burning crown,**  
**The curses of thy land?**  
***Our king by thee cut off, hewn down\!***  
***Go forth* — they cry — *accursèd and forlorn,***  
***To hate and scorn\!*

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**O ye just men, who speak my sentence now,**  
**The city’s hate, the ban of all my realm\!**  
**Ye had no voice of old to launch such doom**  
**On him, my husband, when he held as light**  
**My daughter’s life as that of sheep or goat,**  
**One victim from the thronging fleecy fold\!**  
**Yea, slew in sacrifice his child and mine,**  
**The well-loved issue of my travail-pangs,**  
**To lull and lay the gales that blew from Thrace.**  
**That deed of his, I say, that stain and shame,**  
**Had rightly been atoned by banishment;**  
**But ye, who then were dumb, are stern to judge**  
**This deed of mine that doth affront your ears.**  
**Storm out your threats, yet knowing this for sooth,**  
**That I am ready, if your hand prevail**  
**As mine now doth, to bow beneath your sway:**  
**If God say nay, it shall be yours to learn**  
**By chastisement a late humility.

 

CHORUS**  
**  Bold is thy craft, and proud**  
**Thy confidence, thy vaunting loud;**  
**Thy soul, that chose a murd’ress’ fate,**  
**Is all with blood elate — **  
**Maddened to know**  
**The blood not yet avenged, the damnèd spot**  
**Crimson upon thy brow.**  
**But Fate prepares for thee thy lot — **  
**Smitten as thou didst smite, without a friend,**  
**To meet thine end\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Hear then the sanction of the oath I swear — **  
**By the great vengeance for my murdered child,**  
**By Atè, by the Fury unto whom**  
**This man lies sacrificed by hand of mine,**  
**I do not look to tread the hall of Fear,**  
**While in this hearth and home of mine there burns**  
**The light of love — Ægisthus — as of old**  
**Loyal, a stalwart shield of confidence — **  
**As true to me as this slain man was false,**  
**Wronging his wife with paramours at Troy,**  
**Fresh from the kiss of each Chryseis there\!**  
**Behold him dead — behold his captive prize,**  
**Seeres and harlot — comfort of his bed,**  
**True prophetess, true paramour — I wot**  
**The sea-bench was not closer to the flesh,**  
**Full oft, of every rower, than was she**  
**See, ill they did, and ill requites them now.**  
**His death ye know: she as a dying swan**  
**Sang her last dirge, and lies, as erst she lay,**  
**Close to his side, and to my couch has left**  
**A sweet new taste of joys that know no fear.

 

CHORUS**  
**    Ah woe and well-a-day\! I would that Fate — **  
**Not bearing agony too great,**  
**Nor stretching me too long on couch of pain — **  
**Would bid mine eyelids keep**  
**The morningless and unawakening sleep\!**  
**For life is weary, now my lord is slain,**  
**The gracious among kings\!**  
**Hard fate of old he bore and many grievous things,**  
**And for a woman’s sake, on Ilian land — **  
**Now is his life hewn down, and by a woman’s hand\!

 

O Helen, O infatuate soul,**  
**Who bad’st the tides of battle roll,**  
**O’erwhelming thousands, life on life,**  
**‘Neath Ilion’s wall\!**  
**And now lies dead the lord of all.**  
**The blossom of thy storied sin**  
**Bears blood’s inexpiable stain,**  
**O thou that erst, these halls within,**  
**Wert unto all a rock of strife,**  
**A husband’s bane\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Peace\! pray not thou for death as though**  
**Thine heart was whelmed beneath this woe,**  
**Nor turn thy wrath aside to ban**  
**The name of Helen, nor recall**  
**How she, one bane of many a man,**  
**Sent down to death the Danaan lords,**  
**To sleep at Troy the sleep of swords,**  
**And wrought the woe that shattered all.

 

CHORUS**  
**Fiend of the race\! that swoopest fell**  
**Upon the double stock of Tantalus,**  
**Lording it o’er me by a woman’s will,**  
**Stern, manful, and imperious — **  
**A bitter sway to me\!**  
**Thy very form I see,**  
**Like some grim raven, perched upon the slain,**  
**Exulting o’er the crime, aloud, in tuneless strain\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Right was the word — thou namest well**  
**The brooding race-fiend, triply fell\!**  
**From him it is that murder’s thirst,**  
**Blood-lapping, inwardly is nursed — **  
**Ere time the ancient scar can sain,**  
**New blood comes welling forth again.

 

CHORUS**  
**Grim is his wrath and heavy on our home,**  
**That fiend of whom thy voice has cried,**  
**Alas, an omened cry of woe unsatisfied,**  
**An all-devouring doom\!**  
**As woe, as Zeus\! from Zeus all things befall — **  
**Zeus the high cause and finisher of all\! — **  
**Lord of our mortal state, by him are willed**  
**All things, by him fulfilled\!**  
**Yet ah my king, my king no more\!**  
**What words to say, what tears to pour**  
**Can tell my love for thee?**  
**The spider-web of treachery**  
**She wove and wound, thy life around,**  
**And lo\! I see thee lie,**  
**And thro’ a coward, impious wound**  
**Pant forth thy life and die\!**  
**A death of shame — ah woe on woe\!**  
**A treach’rous hand, a cleaving blow\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**My guilt thou harpest, o’er and o’er\!**  
**I bid thee reckon me no more**  
**As Agamemnon’s spouse.**  
**The old Avenger, stern of mood**  
**For Atreus and his feast of blood,**  
**Hath struck the lord of Atreus’ house,**  
**And in the semblance of his wife**  
**The king hath slain. — **  
**Yea, for the murdered children’s life,**  
**A chieftain’s in requital ta’en.

 

CHORUS**  
**Thou guiltless of this murder, thou\!**  
**Who dares such thought avow?**  
**Yet it may be, wroth for the parent’s deed,**  
**The fiend hath holpen thee to slay the son.**  
**Dark Ares, god of death, is pressing on**  
**Thro’ streams of blood by kindred shed,**  
**Exacting the accompt for children dead,**  
**For clotted blood, for flesh on which their sire did feed.**  
**Yet ah my king, my king no more\!**  
**What words to say, what tears to pour**  
**Can tell my love for thee?**  
**The spider-web of treachery**  
**She wove and wound, thy life around,\]**  
**And lo\! I see thee lie,**  
**And thro’ a coward, impious wound**  
**Pant forth thy life and die\!**  
**A death of shame — ah woe on woe\!**  
**A treach’rous hand, a cleaving blow\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**      I deem not that the death he died**  
**Had overmuch of shame:**  
**For this was he who did provide**  
**Foul wrong unto his house and name:**  
**His daughter, blossom of my womb,**  
**He gave unto a deadly doom,**  
**Iphigenia, child of tears\!**  
**And as he wrought, even so he fares.**  
**Nor be his vaunt too loud in hell;**  
**For by the sword his sin he wrought,**  
**And by the sword himself is brought**  
**Among the dead to dwell.

 

CHORUS**  
**      Ah whither shall I fly?**  
**For all in ruin sinks the kingly hall;**  
**Nor swift device nor shift of thought have I,**  
**To ‘scape its fall.**  
**A little while the gentler raindrops fail;**  
**I stand distraught — a ghastly interval,**  
**Till on the roof-tree rings the bursting hail**  
**Of blood and doom. Even now fate whets the steel**  
**On whetstones new and deadlier than of old,**  
**The steel that smites, in Justice’ hold,**  
**Another death to deal.

 

O Earth\! that I had lain at rest**  
**And lapped for ever in thy breast,**  
**Ere I had seen my chieftain fall**  
**Within the laver’s silver wall,**  
**Low-lying on dishonoured bier\!**  
**And who shall give him sepulchre,**  
**And who the wail of sorrow pour?**  
**Woman, ’tis thine no more\!**  
**A graceless gift unto his shade**  
**Such tribute, by his murd’ress paid\!**  
**Strive not thus wrongly to atone**  
**The impious deed thy hand hath done.**  
**Ah who above the godlike chief?**  
**Shall weep the tears of loyal grief?**  
**Who speak above his lowly grave**  
**The last sad praises of the brave?

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Peace\! for such task is none of thine.**  
**By me he fell, by me he died,**  
**And now his burial rites be mine\!**  
**Yet from these halls no mourners’ train**  
**Shall celebrate his obsequies;**  
**Only by Acheron’s rolling tide**  
**His child shall spring unto his side,**  
**And in a daughter’s loving wise**  
**Shall clasp and kiss him once again\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Lo\! sin by sin and sorrow dogg’d by sorrow — **  
**And who the end can know?**  
**The slayer of today shall die tomorrow — **  
**The wage of wrong is woe.**  
**While Time shall be, while Zeus in heaven is lord,**  
**His law is fixed and stern;**  
**On him that wrought shall vengeance be outpoured — **  
**The tides of doom return.**  
**The children of the curse abide within**  
**These halls of high estate — **  
**And none can wrench from off the home of sin**  
**The clinging grasp of fate.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Now walks thy word aright, to tell**  
**This ancient truth of oracle;**  
**But I with vows of sooth will pray**  
**To him, the power that holdeth sway**  
**O’er all the race of Pleisthenes — **  
***Tho’ dark the deed and deep the guilt,***  
***With this last blood my hands have spilt,***  
***I pray thee let thine anger cease\!***  
***I pray thee pass from us away***  
***To some new race in other lands,***  
***There, if thou wilt, to wrong and slay***  
***The lives of men by kindred hands.***  
**For me’tis all sufficient meed,**  
**Tho’ little wealth or power were won,**  
**So I can say, *’Tis past and done.***  
***The bloody lust and murderous,***  
***The inborn frenzy of our house,***  
***Is ended, by my deed\!*  \[*Enter Ægisthus.*

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**Dawn of the day of rightful vengeance, hail\!**  
**I dare at length aver that gods above**  
**Have care of men and heed of earthly wrongs.**  
**I, I who stand and thus exult to see**  
**This man lie wound in robes the Furies wove,**  
**Slain in requital of his father’s craft.**  
**Take ye the truth, that Atreus, this man’s sire,**  
**The lord and monarch of this land of old,**  
**Held with my sire Thyestes deep dispute,**  
**Brother with brother, for the prize of sway,**  
**And drave him from his home to banishment.**  
**Thereafter, the lorn exile homeward stole**  
**And clung a suppliant to the heart divine,**  
**And for himself won this immunity — **  
**Not with his own blood to defile the land**  
**That gave him birth. But Atreus, godless sire**  
**Of him who here lies dead, this welcome planned — **  
**With zeal that was not love he feigned to hold**  
**In loyal joy a day of festal cheer,**  
**And bade my father to his board, and set**  
**Before him flesh that was his children once.**  
**First, sitting at the upper board alone,**  
**He hid the fingers and the feet, but gave**  
**The rest — and readily Thyestes took**  
**What to his ignorance no semblance wore**  
**Of human flesh, and ate: behold what curse**  
**That eating brought upon our race and name\!**  
**For when he knew what all-unhallowed thing**  
**He thus had wrought, with horror’s bitter cry**  
**Back-starting, spewing forth the fragments foul,**  
**On Pelops’ house a deadly curse he spake — **  
***As darkly as I spurn this damnèd food,***  
***So perish all the race of Pleisthenes\!***  
**Thus by that curse fell he whom here ye see,**  
**And I — who else? — this murder wove and planned;**  
**For me, an infant yet in swaddling bands,**  
**Of the three children youngest, Atreus sent**  
**To banishment by my sad father’s side:**  
**But Justice brought me home once more, grown now**  
**To manhood’s years; and stranger tho’ I was,**  
**My right hand reached unto the chieftain’s life,**  
**Plotting and planning all that malice bade.**  
**And death itself were honour now to me,**  
**Beholding him in Justice’ ambush ta’en.

 

CHORUS**  
**Ægisthus, for this insolence of thine**  
**That vaunts itself in evil, take my scorn.**  
**Of thine own will, thou sayest, thou hast slain**  
**The chieftain, by thine own unaided plot**  
**Devised the piteous death: I rede thee well,**  
**Think not thy head shall ‘scape, when right prevails,**  
**The people’s ban, the stones of death and doom.

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**This word from thee, this word from one who rows**  
**Low at the oars beneath, what time we rule,**  
**We of the upper tier? Thou’lt know anon,**  
**’Tis bitter to be taught again in age,**  
**By one so young, submission at the word.**  
**But iron of the chain and hunger’s throes**  
**Can minister unto an o’erswoln pride**  
**Marvellous well, ay, even in the old.**  
**Hast eyes, and seest not this? Peace — kick not thus**  
**Against the pricks, unto thy proper pain\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Thou womanish man, waiting till war did cease,**  
**Home-watcher and defiler of the couch,**  
**And arch-deviser of the chieftain’s doom\!

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**Bold words again\! but they shall end in tears.**  
**The very converse, thine, of Orpheus’ tongue:**  
**He roused and led in ecstasy of joy**  
**All things that heard his voice melodious;**  
**But thou as with the futile cry of curs**  
**Wilt draw men wrathfully upon thee. Peace\!**  
**Or strong subjection soon shall tame thy tongue.

 

CHORUS**  
**Ay, thou art one to hold an Argive down — **  
**Thou, skilled to plan the murder of the king,**  
**But not with thine own hand to smite the blow\!

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**That fraudful force was woman’s very part,**  
**Not mine, whom deep suspicion from of old**  
**Would have debarred. Now by his treasure’s aid**  
**My purpose holds to rule the citizens.**  
**But whoso will not bear my guiding hand,**  
**Him for his corn-fed mettle I will drive**  
**Not as a trace-horse, light-caparisoned,**  
**But to the shafts with heaviest harness bound.**  
**Famine, the grim mate of the dungeon dark,**  
**Shall look on him and shall behold him tame.

 

CHORUS**  
**Thou losel soul, was then thy strength too slight**  
**To deal in murder, while a woman’s hand,**  
**Staining and shaming Argos and its gods,**  
**Availed to slay him? Ho, if anywhere**  
**The light of life smite on Orestes’ eyes,**  
**Let him, returning by some guardian fate,**  
**Hew down with force her paramour and her\!

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**How thy word and act shall issue, thou shalt shortly understand.

 

CHORUS**  
**Up to action, O my comrades\! for the fight is hard at hand.**  
**Swift, your right hands to the sword hilt\! bare the weapon as for strife — 

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**Lo\! I too am standing ready, hand on hilt for death or life.

 

CHORUS**  
**’Twas thy word and we accept it: onward to the chance of war\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Nay, enough, enough, my champion\! we will smite and slay no more.**  
**Already have we reaped enough the harvest-field of guilt:**  
**Enough of wrong and murder, let no other blood be spilt.**  
**Peace, old men\! and pass away unto the homes by Fate decreed,**  
**Lest ill valour meet our vengeance— ’twas a necessary deed.**  
**But enough of toils and troubles — be the end, if ever, now,**  
**Ere thy talon, O Avenger, deal another deadly blow.**  
**’Tis a woman’s word of warning, and let who will list thereto.

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**But that these should loose and lavish reckless blossoms of the tongue,**  
**And in hazard of their fortune cast upon me words of wrong,**  
**And forget the law of subjects, and revile their ruler’s word — 

 

CHORUS**  
**Ruler? but ’tis not for Argives, thus to own a dastard lord\!

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**I will follow to chastise thee in my coming days of sway.

 

CHORUS**  
**Not if Fortune guide Orestes safely on his homeward way.

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**Ah, well I know how exiles feed on hopes of their return.

 

CHORUS**  
**Fare and batten on pollution of the right, while ’tis thy turn.

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**Thou shalt pay, be well assurèd, heavy quittance for thy pride.

 

CHORUS**  
**Crow and strut, with her to watch thee, like a cock, his mate beside\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Heed not thou too highly of them — let the cur-pack growl and yell:**  
**I and thou will rule the palace and will order all things well.  \[*Exeunt.*

ORESTES

 

LORD of the shades and patron of the realm**  
**That erst my father swayed, list now my prayer,**  
**Hermes, and save me with thine aiding arm,**  
**Me who from banishment returning stand**  
**On this my country; lo, my foot is set**  
**On this grave-mound, and herald-like, as thou,**  
**Once and again, I bid my father hear.**  
**And these twin locks, from mine head shorn, I bring,**  
**And one to Inachus the river-god,**  
**My young life’s nurturer, I dedicate,**  
**And one in sign of mourning unfulfilled**  
**I lay, though late, on this my father’s grave.**  
**For O my father, not beside thy corse**  
**Stood I to wail thy death, nor was my hand**  
**Stretched out to bear thee forth to burial.**  
**What sight is yonder? what this woman-throng**  
**Hitherward coming, by their sable garb**  
**Made manifest as mourners? What hath chanced?**  
**Doth some new sorrow hap within the home\!**  
**Or rightly may I deem that they draw near**  
**Bearing libations, such as soothe the ire**  
**Of dead men angered, to my father’s grave?**  
**Nay, such they are indeed; for I descry**  
**Electra, mine own sister, pacing hither,**  
**In moody grief conspicuous. Grant, O Zeus,**  
**Grant me my father’s murder to avenge — **  
**Be thou my willing champion\!**  
**                 Pylades,**  
**Pass we aside, till rightly I discern**  
**Wherefore these women throng in suppliance.  \[*Exeunt Pylades and Orestes; enter the Chorus, bearing vessels for libation; Electra follows them; they pace slowly towards the tomb of Agamemnon.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Forth from the royal halls by high command**  
**I bear libations for the dead.**  
**Rings on my smitten breast my smiting hand,**  
**And all my cheek is rent and red,**  
**Fresh-furrowed by my nails, and all my soul**  
**This many a day doth feed on cries of dole.**  
**And trailing tatters of my vest,**  
**In looped and windowed raggedness forlorn,**  
**Hang rent around my breast,**  
**Even as I, by blows of Fate most stern**  
**Saddened and torn.**  
**Oracular thro’ visions, ghastly clear,**  
**Bearing a blast of wrath from realms below,**  
**And stiffening each rising hair with dread,**  
**Came out of dreamland Fear,**  
**And, loud and awful, bade**  
**The shriek ring out at midnight’s witching hour,**  
**And brooded, stern with woe,**  
**Above the inner house, the woman’s bower.**  
**And seers inspired did read the dream on oath,**  
**Chanting aloud *In realms below***  
***The dead are wroth;***  
***Against their slayers yet their ire doth glow.***  
**Therefore to bear this gift of graceless worth — 

 

O Earth, my nursing mother\! — **  
**The woman god-accurs’d doth send me forth**  
**Lest one crime bring another.**  
**Ill is the very word to speak, for none**  
**Can ransom or atone**  
**For blood once shed and darkening the plain.**  
**O hearth of woe and bane,**  
**O state that low doth lie\!**  
**Sunless, accursed of men, the shadows brood**  
**Above the home of murdered majesty.**  
**Rumour of might, unquestioned, unsubdued,**  
**Pervading ears and soul of lesser men,**  
**Is silent now and dead.**  
**Yet rules a viler dread;**  
**For bliss and power, however won,**  
**As gods, and more than gods, dazzle our mortal ken.**  
**Justice doth mark, with scales that swiftly sway,**  
**Some that are yet in light;**  
**Others in interspace of day and night,**  
**Till Fate arouse them, stay;**  
**And some are lapped in night, where all things are undone.**  
**On the life-giving lap of Earth**  
**Blood hath flowed forth,**  
**And now, the seed of vengeance, clots the plain — **  
**Unmelting, uneffaced the stain.**  
**And Atè tarries long, but at the last**  
**The sinner’s heart is cast**  
**Into pervading, waxing pangs of pain.**  
**Lo, when man’s force doth ope**  
**The virgin doors, there is nor cure nor hope**  
**For what is lost, — even so, I deem,**  
**Though in one channel ran Earth’s every stream,**  
**Laving the hand defiled from murder’s stain,**  
**It were vain.**  
**And upon me — ah me\! — the gods have laid**  
**The woe that wrapped round Troy,**  
**What time they led me down from home and kin**  
**Unto a slave’s employ — **  
**The doom to bow the head**  
**And watch our master’s will**  
**Work deeds of good and ill — **  
**To see the headlong sway of force and sin,**  
**And hold restrained the spirit’s bitter hate,**  
**Wailing the monarch’s fruitless fate,**  
**Hiding my face within my robe, and fain**  
**Of tears, and chilled with frost of hidden pain.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Handmaidens, orderers of the palace-halls,**  
**Since at my side ye come, a suppliant train,**  
**Companions of this offering, counsel me**  
**As best befits the time: for I, who pour**  
**Upon the grave these streams funereal,**  
**With what fair word can I invoke my sire?**  
**Shall I aver, *Behold, I bear these gifts***  
***From well-loved wife unto her well-loved lord,***  
**When ’tis from her, my mother, that they come?**  
**I dare not say it: of all words I fail**  
**Wherewith to consecrate unto my sire**  
**These sacrificial honours on his grave.**  
**Or shall I speak this word, as mortals use — **  
***Give back, to those who send these coronals,***  
***Full recompense — of ills for acts malign?***  
***Or shall I pour this draught for Earth to drink,***  
**Sans word or reverence, as my sire was slain,**  
**And homeward pass with unreverted eyes,**  
**Casting the bowl away, as one who flings**  
**The household cleansings to the common road?**  
**Be art and part, O friends, in this my doubt,**  
**Even as ye are in that one common hate**  
**Whereby we live attended: fear ye not**  
**The wrath of any man, nor hide your word**  
**Within your breast: the day of death and doom**  
**Awaits alike the freeman and the slave.**  
**Speak, then, if aught thou know’st to aid us more.

 

CHORUS**  
**Thou biddest; I will speak my soul’s thought out,**  
**Revering as a shrine thy father’s grave.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Say then thy say, as thou his tomb reverest.

 

CHORUS**  
**Speak solemn words to them that love, and pour.

 

ELECTRA**  
**And of his kin whom dare I name as kind?

 

CHORUS**  
**Thyself; and next, whoe’er Ægisthus scorns.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Then ’tis myself and thou my prayer must name.

 

CHORUS**  
**Whoe’er they be, ’tis thine to know and name them.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Is there no other we may claim as ours?

 

CHORUS**  
**Think of Orestes, though far-off he be.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Right well in this too hast thou schooled my thought.

 

CHORUS**  
**Mindfully, next, on those who shed the blood — 

 

ELECTRA**  
**Pray on them what? expound, instruct my doubt.

 

CHORUS**  
**This: *Upon them some god or mortal come — *

 

ELECTRA**  
**As judge or as avenger? speak thy thought.

 

CHORUS**  
**Pray in set terms, *Who shall the slayer slay.*

 

ELECTRA**  
**Beseemeth it to ask such boon of heaven?

 

CHORUS**  
**How not, to wreak a wrong upon a foe?

 

ELECTRA**  
**O mighty Hermes, warder of the shades,**  
**Herald of the upper and of under world,**  
**Proclaim and usher down my prayer’s appeal**  
**Unto the god below, that they with eyes**  
**Watchful behold these halls, my sire’s of old — **  
**And unto Earth, the mother of all things,**  
**And foster-nurse, and womb that takes their seed.**  
**Lo, I that pour these draughts for men now dead,**  
**Call on my father, who yet holds in ruth**  
**Me and mine own Orestes, Father, speak — **  
***How shall thy children rule thine halls again?***  
***Homeless we are and sold; and she who sold***  
***Is she who bore us; and the price she took***  
***Is he who joined with her to work thy death,***  
***Ægisthus, her new lord. Behold me here***  
***Brought down to slave’s estate, and far away***  
***Wanders Orestes, banished from the wealth***  
***That once was thine, the profit of thy care,***  
***Whereon these revel in a shameful joy.***  
***Father, my prayer is said; ’tis thine to hear — ***  
***Grant that some fair fate bring Orestes home,***  
***And unto me grant these — a purer soul***  
***Than is my mother’s, a more stainless hand.***  
**These be my prayers for us: for thee, O sire,**  
**I cry that one may come to smite thy foes,**  
**And that the slayers may in turn be slain.**  
**Cursed is their prayer, and thus I bar its path,**  
**Praying mine own, a counter-curse on them.**  
**And thou, send up to us the righteous boon**  
**For which we pray; thine aids be heaven and earth,**  
**And justice guide the right to victory.  \[*To the Chorus.***  
**Thus have I prayed, and thus I shed these streams,**  
**And follow ye the wont, and as with flowers**  
**Crown ye with many a tear and cry the dirge**  
**Your lips ring out above the dead man’s grave.  \[*She pours the libations.*

 

CHORUS**  
**          Woe, woe, woe\!**  
**Let the teardrop fall, plashing on the ground**  
**Where our lord lies low:**  
**Fall and cleanse away the cursed libation’s stain,**  
**Shed on this grave-mound,**  
**Fenced wherein together, gifts of good or bane**  
**From the dead are found.**  
**Lord of Argos, hearken\!**  
**Though around thee darken**  
**Mist of death and hell, arise and hear\!**  
**Hearken and awaken to our cry of woe\!**  
**Who with might of spear**  
**Shall our home deliver?**  
**Who like Ares bend until it quiver,**  
**Bend the northern bow?**  
**Who with hand upon the hilt himself will thrust will glaive,**  
** Thrust and slay and save?

 

ELECTRA**  
**Lo\! the earth drinks them, to my sire they pass — **  
**Learn ye with me of this thing new and strange.

 

CHORUS**  
**Speak thou; my breast doth palpitate with fear.

 

ELECTRA**  
**I see upon the tomb a curl new shorn.

 

CHORUS**  
**Shorn from what man or what deep-girded maid?

 

ELECTRA**  
**That may he guess who will; the sign is plain.

 

CHORUS**  
**Let me learn this of thee; let youth prompt age.

 

ELECTRA**  
**None is there here but I, to clip such gift.

 

CHORUS**  
**For they who thus should mourn him hate him sore.

 

ELECTRA**  
**And lo\! in truth the hair exceeding like — 

 

CHORUS**  
**Like to what locks and whose? instruct me that.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Like unto those my father’s children wear.

 

CHORUS**  
**Then is this lock Orestes’ secret gift?

 

ELECTRA**  
**Most like it is unto the curls he wore.

 

CHORUS**  
**Yet how dared he to come unto his home?

 

ELECTRA**  
**He hath but sent it, clipt to mourn his sire.

 

CHORUS**  
**It is a sorrow grievous at his death,**  
**That he should live, yet never dare return.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Yea, and my heart o’erflows with gall of grief,**  
**And I am pierced as with a cleaving dart;**  
**Like to the first drops after drought, my tears**  
**Fall down at will, a bitter bursting tide,**  
**As on this lock I gaze; I cannot deem**  
**That any Argive save Orestes’ self**  
**Was ever lord thereof; nor, well I wot,**  
**Hath she, the murd’ress, shorn and laid this lock**  
**To mourn him whom she slew — my mother she,**  
**Bearing no mother’s heart, but to her race**  
**A loathing spirit, loathed itself of heaven\!**  
**Yet to affirm, as utterly made sure,**  
**That this adornment cometh of the hand**  
**Of mine Orestes, brother of my soul,**  
**I may not venture, yet hope flatters fair\!**  
**Ah well-a-day, that this dumb hair had voice**  
**To glad mine ears, as might a messenger,**  
**Bidding me sway no more ‘twixt fear and hope,**  
**Clearly commanding, *Cast me hence away,***  
***Clipped was I from some head thou lovest not;***  
**Or, *I am kin to thee, and here, as thou,***  
***I come to weep and deck our father’s grave.***  
**Aid me, ye gods\! for well indeed ye know**  
**How in the gale and counter-gale of doubt,**  
**Like to the seaman’s bark, we whirl and stray.**  
**But, if God will our life, how strong shall spring,**  
**From seed how small, the new tree of our home\! — **  
**Lo ye, a second sign — these footsteps, look, — **  
**Like to my own, a corresponsive print;**  
**And look, another footmark, — this his own,**  
**And that the foot of one who walked with him.**  
**Mark, how the heel and tendons’ print combine,**  
**Measured exact, with mine coincident\!**  
**Alas\! for doubt and anguish rack my mind.

 

ORESTES \(approaching suddenly\)**  
**Pray thou, in gratitude for prayers fulfilled,**  
***Fair fall the rest of what I ask of heaven.*

 

ELECTRA**  
**Wherefore? what win I from the gods by prayer?

 

ORESTES**  
**This, that thine eyes behold thy heart’s desire.

 

ELECTRA**  
**On whom of mortals know’st thou that I call?

 

ORESTES**  
**I know thy yearning for Orestes deep.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Say then wherein event hath crowned my prayer?

 

ORESTES**  
**I, I am he; seek not one more akin.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Some fraud, O stranger, weavest thou for me?

 

ORESTES**  
**Against myself I weave it, if I weave.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Ah, thou hast mind to mock me in my woe\!

 

ORESTES**  
**’Tis at mine own I mock them, mocking thine.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Speak I with thee then as Orestes’ self?

 

ORESTES**  
**My very face thou see’st and know’st me not,**  
**And yet but now, when thou didst see the lock**  
**Shorn for my father’s grave, and when thy quest**  
**Was eager on the footprints I had made,**  
**Even I, thy brother, shaped and sized as thou,**  
**Fluttered thy spirit, as at sight of me\!**  
**Lay now this ringlet whence ’twas shown, and judge,**  
**And look upon this robe, thine own hands’ work,**  
**The shuttle-prints, the creature wrought thereon — **  
**Refrain thyself, nor prudence lose in joy,**  
**For well I wot, our kin are less than kind.

 

ELECTRA**  
**O thou that art unto our father’s home**  
**Love, grief, and hope, for thee the tears ran down,**  
**For thee, the son, the saviour that should be;**  
**Trust thou thine arm and win thy father’s halls\!**  
**O aspect sweet of fourfold love to me,**  
**Whom upon thee the heart’s constraint bids call**  
**As on my father, and the claim of love**  
**From me unto my mother turns to thee,**  
**For she is very hate; to thee too turns**  
**What of my heart went out to her who died**  
**A ruthless death upon the altar-stone;**  
**And for myself I love thee — thee that wast**  
**A brother leal, sole stay of love to me.**  
**Now by thy side be strength and right, and Zeus**  
**Saviour almighty, stand to aid the twain\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Zeus, Zeus\! look down on our estate and us,**  
**The orphaned brood of him, our eagle-sire,**  
**Whom to his death a fearful serpent brought,**  
**Enwinding him in coils; and we, bereft**  
**And foodless, sink with famine, all too weak**  
**To bear unto the eyrie, as he bore,**  
**Such quarry as he slew. Lo\! I and she,**  
**Electra, stand before thee, fatherless,**  
**And each alike cast out and homeless made.

 

ELECTRA**  
**And if thou leave to death the brood of him**  
**Whose altar blazed for thee, whose reverence**  
**Was thine, all thine, — whence, in the after years,**  
**Shall any hand like his adorn thy shrine**  
**With sacrifice of flesh? the eaglets slain,**  
**Thou wouldst not have a messenger to bear**  
**Thine omens, once so clear, to mortal men;**  
**So, if this kingly stock be withered all,**  
**None on high festivals will fend thy shrine.**  
**Stoop thou to raise us\! strong the race shall show,**  
**Though puny now it seem, and fallen low.

 

CHORUS**  
**O children, saviours of your father’s home,**  
**Beware ye of your words, lest one should hear**  
**And bear them, for the tongue hath lust to tell,**  
**Unto our masters — whom God grant to me**  
**In pitchy reek of fun’ral flame to see\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Nay, mighty is Apollo’s oracle**  
**And shall not fail me, whom it bade to pass**  
**Thro’ all this peril; clear the voice rang out**  
**With many warnings, sternly threatening**  
**To my hot heart the wintry chill of pain,**  
**Unless upon the slayers of my sire**  
**I pressed for vengeance: this the god’s command — **  
**That I, in ire for home and wealth despoiled,**  
**Should with a craft like theirs the slayers slay:**  
**Else with my very life I should atone**  
**This deed undone, in many a ghastly wise.**  
**For he proclaimed unto the ears of men**  
**That offerings, poured to angry power of death,**  
**Exude again, unless their will be done,**  
**As grim disease on those that poured them forth — **  
**As leprous ulcers mounting on the flesh**  
**And with fell fangs corroding what of old**  
**Wore natural form; and on the brow arise**  
**White poisoned hairs, the crown of this disease.**  
**He spake, moreover, of assailing fiends**  
**Empowered to quit on me my father’s blood,**  
**Wreaking their wrath on me, what time in night**  
**Beneath shut lids the spirit’s eye sees clear.**  
**The dart that flies in darkness, sped from hell**  
**By spirits of the murdered dead who call**  
**Unto their kin for vengeance, formless fear,**  
**The nighttide’s visitant, and madness’ curse**  
**Should drive and rack me; and my tortured frame**  
**Should be chased forth from man’s community**  
**As with the brazen scorpions of the scourge.**  
**For me and such as me no lustral bowl**  
**Should stand, no spilth of wine be poured to God**  
**For me, and wrath unseen of my dead sire**  
**Should drive me from the shrine; no man should dare**  
**To take me to his hearth, nor dwell with me:**  
**Slow, friendless, cursed of all should be mine end,**  
**And pitiless horror wind me for the grave.**  
**This spake the god — this dare I disobey?**  
**Yea, though I dared, the deed must yet be done;**  
**For to that end diverse desires combine, — **  
**The god’s behest, deep grief for him who died,**  
**And last, the grievous blank of wealth despoiled — **  
**All these weigh on me, urge that Argive men,**  
**Minions of valour, who with soul of fire**  
**Did make of fenced Troy a ruinous heap,**  
**Be not left slaves to two and each a woman\!**  
**For he, the man, wears woman’s heart; if not,**  
**Soon shall he know, confronted by a man.  \[*Orestes, Electra, and the Chorus gather round the tomb of Agamemnon for the invocation which follows.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Mighty Fates, on you we call\!**  
**Bid the will of Zeus ordain**  
**Power to those to whom again**  
**Justice turns with hand and aid\!**  
**Grievous was the prayer one made — **  
**Grievous let the answer fall\!**  
**Where the mighty doom is set,**  
**Justice claims aloud her debt.**  
**Who in blood hath dipped the steel,**  
**Deep in blood her meed shall feel\!**  
**List an immemorial word — **  
***Whosoe’er shall take the sword***  
***Shall perish by the sword.*

 

ORESTES**  
**Father, unblest in death, O father mine\!**  
**What breath of word or deed**  
**Can I waft on thee from this far confine**  
**Unto thy lowly bed, — **  
**Waft upon thee, in midst of darkness lying,**  
**Hope’s counter-gleam of fire?**  
**Yet the loud dirge of praise brings grace undying**  
**Unto each parted sire.

 

CHORUS**  
**O child, the spirit of the dead,**  
**Altho’ upon his flesh have fed**  
**The grim teeth of the flame,**  
**Is quelled not; after many days**  
**The sting of wrath his soul shall raise,**  
**A vengeance to reclaim\!**  
**To the dead rings loud our cry — **  
**Plain the living’s treachery — **  
**Swelling, shrilling, urged on high,**  
**The vengeful dirge, for parents slain,**  
**Shall strive and shall attain.

 

ELECTRA**  
**    Hear me too, even me, O father, hear\!**  
**Not by one child alone these groans, these tears are shed**  
**Upon thy sepulchre.**  
**Each, each, where thou art lowly laid,**  
**Stands, a suppliant, homeless made:**  
**Ah, and all is full of ill,**  
**Comfort is there none to say\!**  
**Strive and wrestle as we may,**  
**Still stands doom invincible,

 

CHORUS**  
**    Nay, if so he will, the god**  
**Still our tears to joy can turn.**  
**He can bid a triumph-ode**  
**Drown the dirge beside this urn;**  
**He to kingly halls can greet**  
**The child restored, the homeward-guided feet.

 

ORESTES**  
**Ah my father\! hadst thou lain**  
**Under Ilion’s wall,**  
**By some Lycian spearman slain,**  
**Thou hadst left in this thine hall**  
**Honour; thou hadst wrought for us**  
**Fame and life most glorious.**  
**Over-seas if thou hadst died,**  
**Heavily had stood thy tomb,**  
**Heaped on high; but, quenched in pride,**  
**Grief were light unto thy home.

 

CHORUS**  
**Loved and honoured hadst thou lain**  
**By the dead that nobly fell,**  
**In the underworld again,**  
**Where are throned the kings of hell,**  
**Full of sway adorable**  
**Thou hadst stood at their right hand — **  
**Thou that wert, in mortal land,**  
**By Fate’s ordinance and law,**  
**King of kings who bear the crown**  
**And the staff, to which in awe**  
**Mortal men bow down.

 

ELECTRA**  
**  Nay, O father, I were fain**  
**Other fate had fallen on thee.**  
**Ill it were if thou hadst lain**  
**One among the common slain,**  
**Fallen by Scamander’s side — **  
**Those who slew thee there should be\!**  
**Then, untouched by slavery,**  
**We had heard as from afar**  
**Deaths of those who should have died**  
**‘Mid the chance of war.

 

CHORUS**  
**O child, forbear\! things all too high thou sayest.**  
**Easy, but vain, thy cry\!**  
**A boon above all gold is that thou prayest,**  
**An unreached destiny,**  
**As of the blessèd land that far aloof**  
**Beyond the north wind lies;**  
**Yet doth your double prayer ring loud reproof;**  
**A double scourge of sighs**  
**Awakes the dead; th’ avengers rise, though late;**  
**Blood stains the guilty pride**  
**Of the accursed who rule on earth, and Fate**  
**Stands on the children’s side.

 

ELECTRA**  
**That hath sped thro’ mine ear, like a shaft from a bow\!**  
**Zeus, Zeus\! it is thou who dost send from below**  
**A doom on the desperate doer — ere long**  
**On a mother a father shall visit his wrong.

 

CHORUS**  
**    Be it mine to upraise thro’ the reek of the pyre**  
**The chant of delight, while the funeral fire**  
**Devoureth the corpse of a man that is slain**  
**And a woman laid low\!**  
**For who bids me conceal it\! outrending control,**  
**Blows ever the stern blast of hate thro’ my soul,**  
**And before me a vision of wrath and of bane**  
**Flits and waves to and fro.

 

ORESTES**  
**Zeus, thou alone to us art parent now.**  
**Smite with a rending blow**  
**Upon their heads, and bid the land be well:**  
**Set right where wrong hath stood; and thou give ear,

 

O Earth, unto my prayer — **  
**Yea, hear, O mother Earth, and monarchy of hell\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Nay, the law is sternly set — **  
**Blood drops shed upon the ground**  
**Plead for other bloodshed yet;**  
**Loud the call of death doth sound,**  
**Calling guilt of olden time,

 

A Fury, crowning crime with crime.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Where, where are ye, avenging powers,**  
**Puissant Furies of the slain?**  
**Behold the relics of the race**  
**Of Atreus, thrust from pride of place\!

 

O Zeus, what home henceforth is ours,**  
**What refuge to attain?

 

CHORUS**  
**Lo, at your wail my heart throbs, wildly stirred;**  
**Now am I lorn with sadness,**  
**Darkened in all my soul, to hear your sorrow’s word.**  
**Anon to hope, the seat of strength, I rise, — **  
**She, thrusting grief away, lifts up mine eyes**  
**To the new dawn of gladness.

 

ORESTES**  
**Skills it to tell of aught save wrong on wrong,**  
**Wrought by our mother’s deed?**  
**Though now she fawn for pardon, sternly strong**  
**Standeth our wrath, and will nor hear nor heed;**  
**Her children’s soul is wolfish, born from hers,**  
**And softens not by prayers.

 

CHORUS**  
**    I dealt upon my breast the blow**  
**That Asian mourning women know;**  
**Wails from my breast the fun’ral cry,**  
**The Cissian weeping melody;**  
**Stretched rendingly forth, to tatter and tear,**  
**My clenched hands wander, here and there,**  
**From head to breast; distraught with blows**  
**Throb dizzily my brows.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Aweless in hate, O mother, sternly brave\!**  
**As in a foeman’s grave**  
**Thou laid’st in earth a king, but to the bier**  
**No citizen drew near, — **  
**Thy husband, thine, yet for his obsequies,**  
**Thou bad’st no wail arise\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Alas, the shameful burial thou dost speak\!**  
**Yet I the vengeance of his shame will wreak — **  
**That do the gods command\!**  
**That shall achieve mine hand\!**  
**Grant me to thrust her life away, and I**  
**Will dare to die\!

 

CHORUS**  
**List thou the deed\! Hewn down and foully torn,**  
**He to the tomb was borne;**  
**Yea, by her hand, the deed who wrought,**  
**With like dishonour to the grave was brought,**  
**And by her hand she strove, with strong desire,**  
**Thy life to crush, O child, by murder of thy sire:**  
**Bethink thee, hearing, of the shame, the pain**  
**Wherewith that sire was slain\!

 

ELECTRA**  
**Yea, such was the doom of my sire; well-a-day,**  
**I was thrust from his side, — **  
**As a dog from the chamber they thrust me away,**  
**And in place of my laughter rose sobbing and tears,**  
**As in darkness I lay.**  
**O father, if this word can pass to thine ears,**  
**To thy soul let it reach and abide\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Let it pass, let it pierce, thro’ the sense of thine ear,**  
**To thy soul, where in silence it waiteth the hour\!**  
**The past is accomplished; but rouse thee to hear**  
**What the future prepareth; wake and appear,**  
**Our champion, in wrath and in power\!

 

ORESTES**  
**O father, to thy loved ones come in aid.

 

ELECTRA**  
**With tears I call on thee.

 

CHORUS**  
**        Listen and rise to light\!**  
**Be thou with us, be thou against the foe\!**  
**Swiftly this cry arises — even so**  
**Pray we, the loyal band, as we have prayed\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Let their might meet with mine, and their right with my right.

 

ELECTRA**  
**O ye gods, it is yours to decree.

 

CHORUS**  
**Ye call unto the dead; I quake to hear.**  
**Fate is ordained of old, and shall fulfil your prayer.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Alas, the inborn curse that haunts our home,**  
**Of Atè’s bloodstained scourge the tuneless sound\!**  
**Alas, deep insufferable doom,**  
**The stanchless wound\!

 

ORESTES**  
**It shall be stanched, the task is ours, — **  
**Not by a stranger’s, but by kindred hand,**  
**Shall be chased forth the blood-fiend of our land.**  
**Be this our spoken spell, to call Earth’s nether powers\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Lords of a dark eternity,**  
**To you has come the children’s cry,**  
**Send up from hell, fulfil your aid**  
**To them who prayed.

 

ORESTES**  
**O father, murdered in unkingly wise,**  
**Fulfil my prayer, grant me thine halls to sway.

 

ELECTRA**  
**To me, too, grant this boon — dark death to deal**  
**Unto Ægisthus, and to ‘scape my doom.

 

ORESTES**  
**So shall the rightful feasts that mortals pay**  
**Be set for thee; else, not for thee shall rise**  
**The scented reek of altars fed with flesh,**  
**But thou shalt lie dishonoured: hear thou me\!

 

ELECTRA**  
**I too, from my full heritage restored,**  
**Will pour the lustral streams, what time I pass**  
**Forth as a bride from these paternal halls,**  
**And honour first, beyond all graves, thy tomb.

 

ORESTES**  
**Earth, send my sire to fend me in the fight\!

 

ELECTRA**  
**Give fair-faced fortune, O Persephone\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Bethink thee, father, in the laver slain — 

 

ELECTRA**  
**Bethink thee of the net they handselled for thee\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Bonds not of brass ensnared thee, father mine.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Yea, the ill craft of an enfolding robe.

 

ORESTES**  
**By this our bitter speech arise, O sire\!

 

ELECTRA**  
**Raise thou thine head at love’s last, dearest call\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Yea, speed forth Right to aid thy kinsmen’s cause;**  
**Grip for grip, let them grasp the foe, if thou**  
**Willest in triumph to forget thy fall.

 

ELECTRA**  
**Hear me, O father, once again hear me.**  
**Lo\! at thy tomb, two fledglings of thy brood — **  
**A man-child and a maid; hold them in ruth,**  
**Nor wipe them out, the last of Pelops’ line.**  
**For while they live, thou livest from the dead;**  
**Children are memory’s voices, and preserve**  
**The dead from wholly dying: as a net**  
**Is ever by the buoyant corks upheld,**  
**Which save the flex-mesh, in the depth submerged.**  
**Listen, this wail of ours doth rise for thee,**  
**And as thou heedest it thyself art saved.

 

CHORUS**  
**In sooth, a blameless prayer ye spake at length — **  
**The tomb’s requital for its dirge denied:**  
**Now, for the rest, as thou art fixed to do,**  
**Take fortune by the hand and work thy will.

 

ORESTES**  
**The doom is set; and yet I fain would ask — **  
**Not swerving from the course of my resolve, — **  
**Wherefore she sent these offerings, and why**  
**She softens all too late her cureless deed?**  
**An idle boon it was, to send them here**  
**Unto the dead who recks not of such gifts.**  
**I cannot guess her thought, but well I ween**  
**Such gifts are skilless to atone such crime.**  
**Be blood once spilled, and idle strife he strives**  
**Who seeks with other wealth or wine outpoured**  
**To atone the deed. So stands the word, nor fails.**  
**Yet would I know her thought; speak, if thou knowest.

 

CHORUS**  
**I know it, son; for at her side I stood.**  
**’Twas the night-wandering terror of a dream**  
**That flung her shivering from her couch, and bade her — **  
**Her, the accursed of God — these offerings send.

 

ORESTES**  
**Heard ye the dream, to tell it forth aright?

 

CHORUS**  
**Yea, from herself; her womb a serpent bare.

 

ORESTES**  
**What then the sum and issue of the tale?

 

CHORUS**  
**Even as a swaddled child, she lull’d the thing.

 

ORESTES**  
**What suckling craved the creature, born full-fanged?

 

CHORUS**  
**Yet in her dreams she proffered it the breast.

 

ORESTES**  
**How? did the hateful thing not bite her teat?

 

CHORUS**  
**Yea, and sucked forth a blood-gout in the milk.

 

ORESTES**  
**Not vain this dream — it bodes a man’s revenge.

 

CHORUS**  
**Then out of sleep she started with a cry,**  
**And thro’ the palace for their mistress’ aid**  
**Full many lamps, that erst lay blind with night,**  
**Flared into light; then, even as mourners use,**  
**She sends these offerings, in hope to win**  
**A cure to cleave and sunder sin from doom.

 

ORESTES**  
**Earth and my father’s grave, to you I call — **  
**Give this her dream fulfilment, and thro’ me.**  
**I read it in each part coincident**  
**With what shall be; for mark, that serpent sprang**  
**From the same womb as I, in swaddling bands**  
**By the same hands was swathed, lipped the same breast,**  
**And sucking forth the same sweet mother’s-milk**  
**Infused a clot of blood; and in alarm**  
**She cried upon her wound the cry of pain.**  
**The rede is clear: the thing of dread she nursed,**  
**The death of blood she dies; and I, ’tis I,**  
**In semblance of a serpent, that must slay her.**  
**Thou art my seer, and thus I read the dream.

 

CHORUS**  
**So do; yet ere thou doest, speak to us,**  
**Bidding some act, some, by not acting, aid.

 

ORESTES**  
**Brief my command: I bid my sister pass**  
**In silence to the house, and all I bid**  
**This my design with wariness conceal,**  
**That they who did by craft a chieftain slay**  
**May by like craft and in like noose be ta’en,**  
**Dying the death which Loxias foretold — **  
**Apollo, king and prophet undisproved.**  
**I with this warrior Pylades will come**  
**In likeness of a stranger, full equipt**  
**As travellers come, and at the palace gates**  
**Will stand, as stranger, yet in friendship’s bond**  
**Unto this house allied; and each of us**  
**Will speak the tongue that round Parnassus sounds,**  
**Feigning such speech as Phocian voices use.**  
**And what if none of those that tend the gates**  
**Shall welcome us with gladness, since the house**  
**With ills divine is haunted? if this hap,**  
**We at the gate will bide, till, passing by,**  
**Some townsman make conjecture and proclaim,**  
***How? is Ægisthus here, and knowingly***  
***Keeps suppliants aloof, by bolt and bar?***  
**Then shall I win my way; and if I cross**  
**The threshold of the gate, the palace’ guard,**  
**And find him throned where once my father sat — **  
**Or if he come anon, and face to face**  
**Confronting, drop his eyes from mine — I swear**  
**He shall not utter, *Who art thou and whence?***  
**Ere my steel leap, and compassed round with death**  
**Low he shall lie: and thus, full-fed with doom,**  
**The Fury of the house shall drain once more**  
**A deep third draught of rich unmingled blood.**  
**But thou, O sister, look that all within**  
**Be well prepared to give these things event.**  
**And ye — I say ‘twere well to bear a tongue**  
**Full of fair silence and of fitting speech**  
**As each beseems the time; and last, do thou,**  
**Hermes the warder-god, keep watch and ward,**  
**And guide to victory my striving sword.  \[*Exit with Pylades.*

 

CHORUS**  
**  Many and marvellous the things of fear**  
**Earth’s breast doth bear;**  
**And the sea’s lap with many monsters teems,**  
**And windy levin-bolts and meteor-gleams**  
**Breed many deadly things — **  
**Unknown and flying forms, with fear upon their wings,**  
**And in their tread is death;**  
**And rushing whirlwinds, of whose blasting breath**  
**Man’s tongue can tell.**  
**But who can tell aright the fiercer thing,**  
**The aweless soul, within man’s breast inhabiting?**  
**Who tell, how, passion-fraught and love-distraught,**  
**The woman’s eager, craving thought**  
**Doth wed mankind to woe and ruin fell?**  
**Yea, how the loveless love that doth possess**  
**The woman, even as the lioness,**  
**Doth rend and wrest apart, with eager strife,**  
**The link of wedded life?**  
**Let him be the witness, whose thought is not borne on light wings thro’ the air,**  
**But abideth with knowledge, what thing was wrought by Althea’s despair;**  
**For she marr’d the life-grace of her son, with ill counsel rekindled the flame**  
**That was quenched as it glowed on the brand, what time from his mother he came,**  
**With the cry of a new-born child; and the brand from the burning she won,**  
**For the Fates had foretold it coeval, in life and in death, with her son.**  
**Yea, and man’s hate tells of another, even Scylla of murderous guile,**  
**Who slew for an enemy’s sake her father, won o’er by the wile**  
**And the gifts of Cretan Minos, the gauds of the high-wrought gold;**  
**For she clipped from her father’s head the lock that should never wax old,**  
**As he breathed in the silence of sleep, and knew not her craft and her crime — **  
**But Hermes, the guard of the dead, doth grasp her, in fulness of time.**  
**And since of the crimes of the cruel I tell, let my singing record**  
**The bitter wedlock and loveless, the curse on these halls outpoured**  
**The crafty device of a woman, whereby did a chieftain fall,**  
**A warrior stern in his wrath, the fear of his enemies all, — **  
**A song of dishonour, untimely\! and cold is the hearth that was warm,**  
**And ruled by the cowardly spear, the woman’s unwomanly arm.**  
**But the summit and crown of all crimes is that which in Lemnos befel;**  
**A woe and a mourning it is, a shame and a spitting to tell;**  
**And he that in aftertime doth speak of his deadliest thought,**  
**Doth say, *It is like to the deed that of old time in Lemnos was wrought;***  
**And loathed of men were the doers, and perished, they and their seed,**  
**For the gods brought hate upon them; none loveth the impious deed.**  
**It is well of these tales to tell; for the sword in the grasp of Right**  
**With a cleaving, a piercing blow to the innermost heart doth smite,**  
**And the deed unlawfully done is not trodden down nor forgot,**  
**When the sinner outsteppeth the law and heedeth the high God not;**  
**But Justice hath planted the anvil, and Destiny forgeth the sword**  
**That shall smite in her chosen time; by her is the child restored;**  
**And, darkly devising, the Fiend of the house, world-cursed, will repay**  
**The price of the blood of the slain that was shed in the bygone day.  \[*Enter Orestes and Pylades, in guise of travellers.*

 

ORESTES \(knocking at the palace gate\)**  
**What ho\! slave, ho\! I smite the palace gate**  
**In vain, it seems; what ho, attend within, — **  
**Once more, attend; come forth and ope the halls,**  
**If yet Ægisthus holds them hospitable.

 

SLAVE \(from within\)**  
**Anon, anon\!**  
**\[*Opens the door.***  
**Speak, from what land art thou, and sent from whom?

 

ORESTES**  
**Go, tell to them who rule the palace halls,**  
**Since ’tis to them I come with tidings new — **  
**\(Delay not — Night’s dark car is speeding on,**  
**And time is now for wayfarers to cast**  
**Anchor in haven, wheresoe’er a house**  
**Doth welcome strangers\) — that there now come forth**  
**Some one who holds authority within — **  
**The queen, or, if some man, more seemly were it;**  
**For when man standeth face to face with man,**  
**No stammering modesty confounds their speech,**  
**But each to each doth tell his meaning clear.  \[*Enter Clytemnestra.*

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Speak on, O strangers; have ye need of aught?**  
**Here is whate’er beseems a house like this — **  
**Warm bath and bed, tired Nature’s soft restorer,**  
**And courteous eyes to greet you; and if aught**  
**Of graver import needeth act as well,**  
**That, as man’s charge, I to a man will tell.

 

ORESTES

A Daulian man am I, from Phocis bound,**  
**And as with mine own travel-scrip self-laden**  
**I went toward Argos, parting hitherward**  
**With travelling foot, there did encounter me**  
**One whom I knew not and who knew not me,**  
**But asked my purposed way nor hid his own,**  
**And, as we talked together, told his name — **  
**Strophius of Phocis; then he said, “Good sir,**  
**Since in all case thou art to Argos bound,**  
**Forget not this my message, heed it well,**  
**Tell to his own, *Orestes is no more.***  
**And — whatsoe’er his kinsfolk shall resolve,**  
**Whether to bear his dust unto his home,**  
**Or lay him here, in death as erst in life**  
**Exiled for aye, a child of banishment — **  
**Bring me their hest, upon thy backward road;**  
**For now in brazen compass of an urn**  
**His ashes lie, their dues of weeping paid.”**  
**So much I heard, and so much tell to thee,**  
**Not knowing if I speak unto his kin**  
**Who rule his home; but well, I deem, it were,**  
**Such news should earliest reach a parent’s ear.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Ah woe is me\! thy word our ruin tells;**  
**From roof-tree unto base are we despoiled. — **  
**O thou whom nevermore we wrestle down,**  
**Thou Fury of this home, how oft and oft**  
**Thou dost descry what far aloof is laid,**  
**Yea, from afar dost bend th’ unerring bow**  
**And rendest from my wretchedness its friends;**  
**As now Orestes — who, a brief while since,**  
**Safe from the mire of death stood warily, — **  
**Was the home’s hope to cure th’ exulting wrong;**  
**Now thou ordainest, *Let the ill abide.*

 

ORESTES**  
**To host and hostess thus with fortune blest,**  
**Lief had I come with better news to bear**  
**Unto your greeting and acquaintanceship;**  
**For what goodwill lies deeper than the bond**  
**Of guest and host? and wrong abhorred it were,**  
**As well I deem, if I, who pledged my faith**  
**To one, and greetings from the other had,**  
**Bore not aright the tidings ‘twixt the twain.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Whate’er thy news, thou shalt not welcome lack,**  
**Meet and deserved, nor scant our grace shall be.**  
**Hadst thou thyself not come, such tale to tell,**  
**Another, sure, had borne it to our ears.**  
**But lo\! the hour is here when travelling guests,**  
**Fresh from the daylong labour of the road,**  
**Should win their rightful due. Take him within  \[*To the slave.***  
**To the man-chamber’s hospitable rest — **  
**Him and these fellow-farers at his side;**  
**Give them such guest-right as beseems our halls;**  
**I bid thee do as thou shalt answer for it.**  
**And I unto the prince who rules our home**  
**Will tell the tale, and, since we lack not friends,**  
**With them will counsel how this hap to bear.\[*Exit Clytemnestra.*

 

CHORUS**  
**        So be it done — **  
**Sister — servants, when draws nigh**  
**Time for us aloud to cry,**  
***Orestes and his victory?***  
**O holy earth and holy tomb**  
**Over the grave — pit heaped on high,**  
**Where low doth Agamemnon lie,**  
**The king of ships, the army’s lord\!**  
**Now is the hour — give ear and come,**  
**For now doth Craft her aid afford,**  
**And Hermes, guard of shades in hell,**  
**Stands o’er their strife, to sentinel**  
**The dooming of the sword.**  
**I wot the stranger worketh woe within — **  
**For lo\! I see come forth, suffused with tears,**  
**Orestes’ nurse. What ho, Kilissa — thou**  
**Beyond the doors? Where goest thou? Methinks**  
**Some grief unbidden walketh at thy side.\[*Enter Kilissa, a nurse.*

 

KILISSA**  
**My mistress bids me, with what speed I may,**  
**Call in Ægisthus to the stranger guests,**  
**That he may come, and standing face to face,**  
**A man with men, may thus more clearly learn**  
**This rumour new. Thus speaking, to her slaves**  
**She hid beneath the glance of fictive grief**  
**Laughter for what is wrought — to her desire**  
**Too well; but ill, ill, ill besets the house,**  
**Brought by the tale these guests have told so clear.**  
**And he, God wot, will gladden all his heart**  
**Hearing this rumour. Woe and well-a-day\!**  
**The bitter mingled cup of ancient woes,**  
**Hard to be borne, that here in Atreus’ house**  
**Befel, was grievous to mine inmost heart,**  
**But never yet did I endure such pain.**  
**All else I bore with set soul patiently;**  
**But now — alack, alack\! — Orestes dear,**  
**The day — and night-long travail of my soul\!**  
**Whom from his mother’s womb, a new-born child,**  
**I clasped and cherished\! Many a time and oft**  
**Toilsome and profitless my service was,**  
**When his shrill outcry called me from my couch\!**  
**For the young child, before the sense is born,**  
**Hath but a dumb thing’s life, must needs be nursed**  
**As its own nature bids. The swaddled thing**  
**Hath nought of speech, whate’er discomfort come — **  
**Hunger or thirst or lower weakling need, — **  
**For the babe’s stomach works its own relief.**  
**Which knowing well before, yet oft surprised,**  
**’Twas mine to cleanse the swaddling clothes — poor I**  
**Was nurse to tend and fuller to make white;**  
**Two works in one, two handicrafts I took,**  
**When in mine arms the father laid the boy.**  
**And now he’s dead — alack and well — a — day\!**  
**Yet must I go to him whose wrongful power**  
**Pollutes this house — fair tidings these to him\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Say then with what array she bids him come?

 

KILISSA**  
**What say’st thou\! Speak more clearly for mine ear.

 

CHORUS**  
**Bids she bring henchmen, or to come alone?

 

KILISSA**  
**She bids him bring a spear-armed body-guard.

 

CHORUS**  
**Nay, tell not that unto our loathed lord,**  
**But speed to him, put on the mien of joy,**  
**Say, *Come along, fear nought, the news is good:***  
**A bearer can tell straight a twisted tale.

 

KILISSA**  
**Does then thy mind in this new tale find joy?

 

CHORUS**  
**What if Zeus bid our ill wind veer to fair?

 

KILISSA**  
**And how? the home’s hope with Orestes dies.

 

CHORUS**  
**Not yet — a seer, though feeble, this might see.

 

KILISSA**  
**What say’st thou? Know’st thou aught this tale belying?

 

CHORUS**  
**Go, tell the news to him, perform thine hest, — **  
**What the gods will, themselves can well provide.

 

KILISSA**  
**Well, I will go, herein obeying thee;**  
**And luck fall fair, with favour sent from heaven.  \[*Exit.*

 

CHORUS**  
**    Zeus, sire of them who on Olympus dwell,**  
**Hear thou, O hear my prayer\!**  
**Grant to my rightful lords to prosper well**  
**Even as their zeal is fair\!**  
**For right, for right goes up aloud my cry — **  
**Zeus, aid him, stand anigh\!**  
**Into his father’s hall he goes**  
**To smite his father’s foes.**  
**Bid him prevail\! by thee on throne of triumph set,**  
**Twice, yea and thrice with joy shall acquit the debt.**  
**Bethink thee, the young steed, the orphan foal**

**Of doom is harnessed fast.**  
**Guide him aright, plant firm a lasting goal,**  
**Speed thou his pace, — O that no chance may mar**

**And ye who dwell within the inner chamber**  
**Where shines the stored joy of gold — **  
**Gods of one heart, O hear ye, and remember;**  
**Up and avenge the blood shed forth of old,**  
**With sudden rightful blow;**  
**Then let the old curse die, nor be renewed**  
**With progeny of blood, — **  
**Once more, and not again, be latter guilt laid low\!**  
**O thou who dwell’st in Delphi’s mighty cave,**  
**Grant us to see this home once more restored**  
**Unto its rightful lord\!**  
**Let it look forth, from veils of death, with joyous eye**  
**Unto the dawning light of liberty;**  
**And Hermes, Maia’s child, lend hand to save,**  
**Willing the right, and guide**  
**Our state with Fortune’s breeze adown the favouring tide.**  
**Whate’er in darkness hidden lies,**  
**He utters at his will;**  
**He at his will throws darkness on our eye,**  
**By night and eke by day inscrutable.**  
**Then, then shall wealth atone**  
**The ills that here were done.**  
**Then, then will we unbind,**  
**Fling free on wafting wind**  
**Of joy, the woman’s voice that waileth now**  
**In piercing accents for a chief laid low;**  
**And this our songs shall be — **  
***Hail to the commonwealth restored\!***  
***Hail to the freedom won to me\!***  
***All hail\! for doom hath passed from him, my well — loved lord\!***  
**And thou, O child, when Time and Chance agree,**  
**Up to the deed that for thy sire is done\!**  
**And if she wail unto thee, *Spare, O son — ***  
**Cry, *Aid, O father* — and achieve the deed,**  
**The horror of man’s tongue, the gods’ great need\!**  
**Hold in thy breast such heart as Perseus had,**  
**The bitter woe work forth,**  
**Appease the summons of the dead,**  
**The wrath of friends on earth;**  
**Yea, set within a sign of blood and doom,**  
**And do to utter death him that pollutes thy home.  \[*Enter Ægisthus.*

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**Hither and not unsummoned have I come;**  
**For a new rumour, borne by stranger men**  
**Arriving hither, hath attained mine ears.**  
**Of hap unwished-for, even Orestes’ death.**  
**This were new sorrow, a blood-bolter’s load**  
**Laid on the house that doth already bow**  
**Beneath a former wound that festers deep.**  
**Dare I opine these words have truth and life?**  
**Or are they tales, of woman’s terror born,**  
**That fly in the void air, and die disproved?**  
**Canst thou tell aught, and prove it to my soul?

 

CHORUS**  
**What we have heard, we heard; go thou within**  
**Thyself to ask the strangers of their tale.**  
**Strengthless are tidings, thro’ another heard;**  
**Question is his to whom the tale is brought.

 

ÆGISTHUS**  
**I too will meet and test the messenger,**  
**Whether himself stood witness of the death**  
**Or tells it merely from dim rumour learnt:**  
**None shall cheat me, whose soul hath watchful eyes.  \[*Exit.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Zeus, Zeus\! what word to me is given?**  
**What cry or prayer, invoking heaven,**  
**Shall first by me be uttered?**  
**What speech of craft — nor all revealing,**  
**Nor all too warily concealing — **  
**Ending my speech, shall aid the deed?**  
**For lo\! in readiness is laid**  
**The dark emprise, the rending blade;**  
**Blood-dropping daggers shall achieve**  
**The dateless doom of Atreus’ name,**  
**Or — kindling torch and joyful flame**  
**In sign of new-won liberty — **  
**Once more Orestes shall retrieve**  
**His father’s wealth, and throned on high,**  
**Shall hold the city’s fealty.**  
**So mighty is the grasp whereby,**  
**Heaven-holpen, he shall trip and throw**  
**Unseconded, a double foe.**  
**Ho for the victory\!  \[*A loud cry within.*

 

VOICE OF ÆGISTHUS**  
**Help, help, alas\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Ho there, ho\! how is’t within?**  
**Is’t done? is’t over? Stand we here aloof**  
**While it is wrought, that guiltless we may seem**  
**Of this dark deed; with death is strife fulfilled.\[*Enter a slave.*

 

SLAVE**  
**O woe, O woe, my lord is done to death\!**  
**Woe, woe, and again, Ægisthus gone\!**  
**Hasten, fling wide the doors, unloose the bolts**  
**Of the queen’s chamber. O for some young strength**  
**To match the need\! but aid availeth nought**  
**To him laid low for ever. Help, help, help\!**  
**Sure to deaf ears I shout, and call in vain**  
**To slumber ineffectual. What ho\!**  
**The queen\! how fareth Clytemnestra’s self?**  
**Her neck too, hers, is close upon the steel,**  
**And soon shall sink, hewn thro’ as justice wills.  \[*Enter Clytemnestra.*

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**What ails thee, raising this ado for us?

 

SLAVE**  
**I say the dead are come to slay the living.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Alack, I read thy riddles all to clear — **  
**We slew by craft and by like craft shall die.**  
**Swift, bring the axe that slew my lord of old;**  
**I’ll know anon or death or victory — **  
**So stands the curse, so I confront it here.  \[*Enter Orestes, his sword dropping with blood.*

 

ORESTES**  
**Thee too I seek: for him what’s done will serve.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Woe, woe\! Ægisthus, spouse and champion, slain\!

 

ORESTES**  
**What, lov’st the man? then in his grave lie down,**  
**Be his in death, desert him nevermore\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Stay, child, and fear to strike, O son, this breast**  
**Pillowed thine head full oft, while, drowsed with sleep,**  
**Thy toothless mouth drew mother’s milk from me.

 

ORESTES**  
**Can I my mother spare? speak, Pylades.

 

PYLADES**  
**Where then would fall the hest Apollo gave**  
**At Delphi, where the solemn compact sworn?**  
**Choose thou the hate of all men, not of gods.

 

ORESTES**  
**Thou dost prevail; I hold thy counsel good.  \[*To Clytemnestra.***  
**Follow; I will to slay thee at his side.**  
**With him whom in his life thou lovedst more**  
**Than Agamemnon, sleep in death, the meed**  
**For hate where love, and love where hate was due\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**I nursed thee young; must I forego mine eld?

 

ORESTES**  
**Thou slew’st my father; shalt thou dwell with me?

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Fate bore a share in these things, O my child\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Fate also doth provide this doom for thee.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Beware, O child, a parent’s dying curse.

 

ORESTES**  
**A parent who did cast me out to ill\!

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Not cast thee out, but to a friendly home.

 

ORESTES**  
**Born free, I was by twofold bargain sold.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Where then the price that I received for thee?

 

ORESTES**  
**The price of shame; I taunt thee not more plainly.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Nay, but recount thy father’s lewdness too.

 

ORESTES**  
**keeping, chide not him who toils without.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**’Tis hard for wives to live as widows, child.

 

ORESTES**  
**The absent husband toils for them at home.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Thou growest fain to slay thy mother, child.

 

ORESTES**  
**Nay, ’tis thyself wilt slay thyself, not I.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Beware thy mother’s vengeful hounds from hell.

 

ORESTES**  
**How shall I ‘scape my father’s, sparing thee?

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Living, I cry as to a tomb, unheard.

 

ORESTES**  
**My father’s fate ordains this doom for thee.

 

CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Ah, me\! this snake it was I bore and nursed.

 

ORESTES**  
**Ay, right prophetic was thy visioned fear.**  
**Shameful thy deed was — die the death of shame\!  \[*Exit, driving Clytemnestra before him.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Lo, even for these I mourn, a double death:**  
**Yet since Orestes, driven on by doom,**  
**Thus crowns the height of murders manifold,**  
**I say, ’tis well that not in night and death**  
**Should sink the eye and light of this our home.**  
**There came on Priam’s race and name**  
**A vengeance; though it tarried long,**  
**With heavy doom it came.**  
**Came, too, on Agamemnon’s hall**  
**A lion-pair, twin swordsmen strong.**  
**And last, the heritage doth fall**  
**To him to whom from Pythian cave**  
**The god his deepest counsel gave.**  
**Cry out, rejoice\! our kingly hall**  
**Hath ‘scaped from ruin — ne’er again**  
**Its ancient wealth be wasted all**  
**By two usurpers, is sin-defiled — **  
**An evil path of woe and bane\!**  
**On him who dealt the dastard blow**  
**Comes Craft, Revenge’s scheming child.**  
**And hand in hand with him doth go,**  
** Eager for fight,**  
**The child of Zeus, whom men below**  
**Call Justice, naming her aright.**  
**And on her foes her breath**  
**Is as the blast of death;**  
**For her the god who dwells in deep recess**  
**Beneath Parnassus’ brow,**  
**Summons with loud acclaim**  
**To rise, though late and lame,**  
**And come with craft that worketh righteousness.**  
**For even o’er powers divine this law is strong — **  
***Thou shalt not serve the wrong.***  
**To that which ruleth heaven beseems it that we bow.**  
**Lo, freedom’s light hath come\!**  
**Lo, now is rent away**  
**The grim and curbing bit that held us dumb.**  
**Up to the light, ye halls\! this many a day**  
**Too low on earth ye lay.**  
**And Time, the great Accomplisher,**  
**Shall cross the threshold, whensoe’er**  
**He choose with purging hand to cleanse**  
**The palace, driving all pollution thence.**  
**And fair the cast of Fortune’s die**  
**Before our state’s new lords shall lie,**  
**Not as of old, but bringing fairer doom.**  
**Lo, freedom’s light hath come\!  \[*The scene opens, disclosing Orestes standing over the corpses of Ægisthus and Clytemnestra; in one hand he holds his sword, in the other the robe in which Agamemnon was entangled and slain.*

 

ORESTES**  
**There lies our country’s twofold tyranny,**  
**My father’s slayers, spoilers of my home.**  
**Erst were they royal, sitting on the throne,.**  
**And loving are they yet, — their common fate**  
**Tells the tale truly, shows their trothplight firm.**  
**They swore to work mine ill — starred father’s death,**  
**They swore to die together; ’tis fulfilled.**  
**O ye who stand, this great doom’s witnesses,**  
**Behold this too, the dark device which bound**  
**My sire unhappy to his death, — behold**  
**The mesh which trapped his hands, enwound his feet\!**  
**Stand round, unfold it— ’tis the trammel — net**  
**That wrapped a chieftain; hold it that he see,**  
**The father — not my sire, but he whose eye**  
**Is judge of all things, the all — seeing Sun\!**  
**Let him behold my mother’s damnèd deed,**  
**Then let him stand, when need shall be to me,**  
**Witness that justly I have sought and slain**  
**My mother; blameless was Ægisthus’ doom — **  
**He died the death law bids adulterers die.**  
**But she who plotted this accursed thing**  
**To slay her lord, by whom she bare beneath**  
**Her girdle once the burden of her babes,**  
**Beloved erewhile, now turned to hateful foes — **  
**What deem ye of her? or what venomed thing,**  
**Sea-snake or adder, had more power than she**  
**To poison with a touch the flesh unscarred?**  
**So great her daring, such her impious will.**  
**How name her, if I may not speak a curse?**  
**A lion-springe\! a laver’s swathing cloth,**  
**Wrapping a dead man, twining round his feet — **  
**A net, a trammel, an entangling robe?**  
**Such were the weapon of some strangling thief,**  
**The terror of the road, a cut-purse hound — **  
**With such device full many might he kill,**  
**Full oft exult in heat of villainy.**  
**Ne’er have my house so cursed an indweller — **  
**Heaven send me, rather, childless to be slain\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Woe for each desperate deed\!**  
**Woe for the queen, with shame of life bereft\!**  
**And ah, for him who still is left,**  
**Madness, dark blossom of a bloody seed\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Did she the deed or not? this robe gives proof,**  
**Imbrued with blood that bathed Ægisthus’ sword:**  
**Look, how the spurted stain combines with time**  
**To blur the many dyes that once adorned**  
**Its pattern manifold\! I now stand here,**  
**Made glad, made sad with blood, exulting, wailing — **  
**Hear, O thou woven web that slew my sire\!**  
**I grieve for deed and death and all my home — **  
**Victor, pollution’s damnèd stain for prize.

 

CHORUS**  
**Alas, that none of mortal men**  
**Can pass his life untouched by pain\!**  
**Behold, one woe is here — **  
**Another loometh near.

 

ORESTES**  
**Hark ye and learn — for what the end shall be**  
**For me I know not: breaking from the curb,**  
**My spirit whirls me off, a conquered prey,**  
**Borne as a charioteer by steeds distraught**  
**Far from the course, and madness in my breast**  
**Burneth to chant its song, and leap, and rave — **  
**Hark ye and learn, friends, ere my reason goes\!**  
**I say that rightfully I slew my mother,**  
**A thing God-scorned, that foully slew my sire.**  
**And chiefest wizard of the spell that bound me**  
**Unto this deed I name the Pythian seer**  
**Apollo, who foretold that if I slew,**  
**The guilt of murder done should pass from me;**  
**But if I spared, the fate that should be mine**  
**I dare not blazon forth — the bow of speech**  
**Can reach not to the mark, that doom to tell.**  
**And now behold me, how with branch and crown**  
**I pass, a suppliant made meet to go**  
**Unto Earth’s midmost shrine, the holy ground**  
**Of Loxias, and that renowned light**  
**Of ever-burning fire, to ‘scape the doom**  
**Of kindred murder: to no other shrine**  
**\(So Loxias bade\) may I for refuge turn.**  
**Bear witness, Argives, in the aftertime,**  
**How came on me this dread fatality.**  
**Living, I pass a banished wanderer hence,**  
**To leave in death the memory of this cry.

 

CHORUS**  
**Nay, but the deed is well; link not thy lips**  
**To speech ill-starred, nor vent ill-boding words — **  
**Who hast to Argos her full freedom given,**  
**Lopping two serpents’ heads with timely blow.

 

ORESTES**  
**Look, look, alas\!**  
**Handmaidens, see — what Gorgon shapes throng up,**  
**Dusky their robes and all their hair enwound — **  
**Snakes coiled with snakes — off, off, I must away\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Most loyal of all sons unto thy sire,**  
**What visions thus distract thee? Hold, abide;**  
**Great was thy victory, and shalt thou fear?

 

ORESTES**  
**These are no dreams, void shapes of haunting ill,**  
**But clear to sight my mother’s hell-hounds come\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Nay, the fresh bloodshed still imbrues thine hands,**  
**And thence distraction sinks into thy soul.

 

ORESTES**  
**O king Apollo — see, they swarm and throng — **  
**Black blood of hatred dripping from their eyes\!

 

CHORUS**  
**One remedy thou hast; go, touch the shrine**  
**Of Loxias, and rid thee of these woes.

 

ORESTES**  
**Ye can behold them not, but I behold them.**  
**Up and away\! I dare abide no more.  \[*Exit.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Farewell than as thou mayst, — the god thy friend**  
**Guard thee and aid with chances favouring.**  
**Behold, the storm of woe divine**  
**That raves and beats on Atreus’ line**  
**Its great third blast hath blown.**  
**First was Thyestes’ loathly woe — **  
**The rueful feast of long ago,**  
**On children’s flesh, unknown.**  
**And next the kingly chief’s despite,**  
**When he who led the Greeks to fight**  
**Was in the bath hewn down.**  
**And now the offspring of the race**  
**Stands in the third, the saviour’s place,**  
**To save — or to consume?**  
**O whither, ere it be fulfilled,**  
**Ere its fierce blast be hushed and stilled,**  
**Shall blow the wind of doom?  \[*Exeunt.*

THE PYTHIAN PRIESTESS

 

FIRST, in this prayer, of all the gods I name**  
**The prophet-mother Earth; and Themis next,**  
**Second who sat — for so with truth is said — **  
**On this her mother’s shrine oracular.**  
**Then by her grace, who unconstrained allowed,**  
**There sat thereon another child of Earth — **  
**Titanian Phœbe. She, in aftertime,**  
**Gave o’er the throne, as birth-gift to a god,**  
**Phœbus, who in his own bears Phœbe’s name.**  
**He from the lake and ridge of Delos’ isle**  
**Steered to the port of Pallas’ Attic shores,**  
**The home of ships; and thence he passed and came**  
**Unto this land and to Parnassus’ shrine.**  
**And at his side, with awe revering him,**  
**There went the children of Hephæstus’ seed,**  
**The hewers of the sacred way, who tame**  
**The stubborn tract that erst was wilderness.**  
**And all this folk, and Delphos, chieftain — king**  
**Of this their land, with honour gave him home;**  
**And in his breast Zeus set a prophet’s soul,**  
**And gave to him this throne, whereon he sits,**  
**Fourth prophet of the shrine, and, Loxias hight,**  
**Gives voice to that which Zeus, his sire, decrees.**  
**Such gods I name in my preluding prayer,**  
**And after them, I call with honour due**  
**On Pallas, wardress of the fane, and Nymphs**  
**Who dwell around the rock Corycian,**  
**Where in the hollow cave, the wild birds’ haunt,**  
**Wander the feet of lesser gods; and there,**  
**Right well I know it, Bromian Bacchus dwells,**  
**Since he in godship led his Mænad host,**  
**Devising death for Pentheus, whom they rent**  
**Piecemeal, as hare among the hounds. And last,**  
**I call on Pleistus’ springs, Poseidon’s might,**  
**And Zeus most high, the great Accomplisher.**  
**Then as a seeress to the sacred chair**  
**I pass and sit; and may the powers divine**  
**Make this mine entrance fruitful in response**  
**Beyond each former advent, triply blest.**  
**And if there stand without, from Hellas bound,**  
**Men seeking oracles, let each pass in**  
**In order of the lot, as use allows;**  
**For the god guides whate’er my tongue proclaims.  \[*She goes into the interior of the temple; after a short interval, she returns in great fear.***  
**Things fell to speak of, fell for eyes to see,**  
**Have sped me forth again from Loxias’ shrine,**  
**With strength unstrung, moving erect no more,**  
**But aiding with my hands my failing feet,**  
**Unnerved by fear. A beldame’s force is naught — **  
**Is as a child’s, when age and fear combine.**  
**For as I pace towards the inmost fane**  
**Bay-filleted by many a suppliant’s hand,**  
**Lo, at the central altar I descry**  
**One crouching as for refuge — yea, a man**  
**Abhorred of heaven; and from his hands, wherein**  
**A sword new-drawn he holds, blood reeked and fell:**  
**A wand he bears, the olive’s topmost bough,**  
**Twined as of purpose with a deep close tuft**  
**Of whitest wool. This, that I plainly saw,**  
**Plainly I tell. But lo, in front of him,**  
**Crouched on the altar-steps, a grisly band**  
**Of women slumbers — not like women they,**  
**But Gorgons rather; nay, that word is weak,**  
**Nor may I match the Gorgons’ shape with theirs\!**  
**Such have I seen in painted semblance erst — **  
**Winged Harpies, snatching food from Phineus’ board, — **  
**But these are wingless, black, and all their shape**  
**The eye’s abomination to behold.**  
**Fell is the breath — let none draw nigh to it — **  
**Wherewith they snort in slumber; from their eyes**  
**Exude the damnèd drops of poisonous ire:**  
**And such their garb as none should dare to bring**  
**To statues of the gods or homes of men.**  
**I wot not of the tribe wherefrom can come**  
**So fell a legion, nor in what land Earth**  
**Could rear, unharmed, such creatures, nor avow**  
**That she had travailed and brought forth death.**  
**But, for the rest, be all these things a care**  
**Unto the mighty Loxias, the lord**  
**Of this our shrine: healer and prophet he,**  
**Discerner he of portents, and the cleanser**  
**Of other homes — behold, his own to cleanse\!  \[*Exit.*  
\[*The scene opens, disclosing the interior of the temple: Orestes clings to the central altar; the Furies lie slumbering at a little distance; Apollo and Hermes appear from the innermost shrine.*

 

APOLLO**  
**Lo, I desert thee never: to the end,**  
**Hard at thy side as now, or sundered far,**  
**I am thy guard, and to thine enemies**  
**Implacably oppose me: look on them,**  
**These greedy fiends, beneath my craft subdued\!**  
**See, they are fallen on sleep, these beldames old,**  
**Unto whose grim and wizened maidenhood**  
**Nor god nor man nor beast can e’er draw near.**  
**Yea, evil were they born, for evil’s doom,**  
**Evil the dark abyss of Tartarus**  
**Wherein they dwell, and they themselves the hate**  
**Of men on earth, and of Olympian gods.**  
**But thou, flee far and with unfaltering speed;**  
**For they shall hunt thee through the mainland wide**  
**Where’er throughout the tract of travelled earth**  
**Thy foot may roam, and o’er and o’er the seas**  
**And island homes of men. Faint not nor fail,**  
**Too soon and timidly within thy breast**  
**Shepherding thoughts forlorn of this thy toil;**  
**But unto Pallas’ city go, and there**  
**Crouch at her shrine, and in thine arms enfold**  
**Her ancient image: there we well shall find**  
**Meet judges for this cause and suasive pleas,**  
**Skilled to contrive for thee deliverance**  
**From all this woe. Be such my pledge to thee,**  
**For by my hest thou didst thy mother slay.

 

ORESTES**  
**O king Apollo, since right well thou know’st**  
**What justice bids, have heed, fulfil the same, — **  
**Thy strength is all-sufficient to achieve.

 

APOLLO**  
**Have thou too heed, nor let thy fear prevail**  
**Above thy will. And do thou guard him, Hermes,**  
**Whose blood is brother unto mine, whose sire**  
**The same high God. Men call thee guide and guard,**  
**Guide therefore thou and guard my suppliant;**  
**For Zeus himself reveres the outlaw’s right,**  
**Boon of fair escort, upon man conferred.**  
**\[*Exeunt Apollo, Hermes, and Orestes. The Ghost of Clytemnestra rises.*

 

GHOST OF CLYTEMNESTRA**  
**Sleep on\! awake\! what skills your sleep to me — **  
**Me, among all the dead by you dishonoured — **  
**Me from whom never, in the world of death,**  
**Dieth this curse, *’Tis she who smote and slew,***  
**And shamed and scorned I roam? Awake, and hear**  
**My plaint of dead men’s hate intolerable.**  
**Me, sternly slain by them that should have loved,**  
**Me doth no god arouse him to avenge,**  
**Hewn down in blood by matricidal hands.**  
**Mark ye these wounds from which the heart’s blood ran,**  
**And by whose hand, bethink ye\! for the sense**  
**When shut in sleep hath then the spirit-sight,**  
**But in the day the inward eye is blind.**  
**List, ye who drank so oft with lapping tongue**  
**The wineless draughty by me outpoured to soothe**  
**Your vengeful ire\! how oft on kindled shrine**  
**I laid the feast of darkness, at the hour**  
**Abhorred of every god but you alone\!**  
**Lo, all my service trampled down and scorned\!**  
**And he hath baulked your chase, as stag the hounds;**  
**Yea, lightly bounding from the circling toils,**  
**Hath wried his face in scorn, and flieth far.**  
**Awake and hear — for mine own soul I cry — **  
**Awake, ye powers of hell\! the wandering ghost**  
**That once was Clytemnestra calls — Arise\!  \[*The Furies mutter grimly, as in a dream.***  
**Mutter and murmur\! He hath flown afar — **  
**My kin have gods to guard them, I have none\!  \[*The Furies mutter as before.***  
**O drowsed in sleep too deep to heed my pain\!**  
**Orestes flies, who me, his mother, slew.  \[*The Furies give a confused cry.***  
**Yelping, and drowsed again? Up and be doing**  
**That which alone is yours, the deed of hell\!  \[*The Furies give another cry.***  
**Lo, sleep and toil, the sworn confederates,**  
**Have quelled your dragon-anger, once so fell\!

 

THE FURIES \(*muttering more fiercely and loudly*\)**  
**Seize, seize, seize, seize — mark, yonder\!

 

GHOST**  
**In dreams ye chase a prey, and like some hound,**  
**That even in sleep doth ply his woodland toil,**  
**Ye bell and bay. What do ye, sleeping here?**  
**Be not o’ercome with toil, nor, sleep-subdued,**  
**Be heedless of my wrong. Up\! thrill your heart**  
**With the just chidings of my tongue, — such words**  
**Are as a spur to purpose firmly held.**  
**Blow forth on him the breath of wrath and blood,**  
**Scorch him with reek of fire that burns in you,**  
**Waste him with new pursuit — swift, hound him down\!  \[*Ghost sinks.*

 

FIRST FURY \(*awaking*\)**  
**Up\! rouse another as I rouse thee; up\!**  
**Sleep’st thou? Rise up, and spurning sleep away,**  
**See we if false to us this prelude rang.

 

CHORUS OF FURIES**  
**Alack, alack, O sisters, we have toiled,**  
**O much and vainly have we toiled and borne\!**  
**Vainly\! and all we wrought the gods have foiled,**  
**       And turnèd us to scorn\!**  
**He hath slipped from the net, whom we chased: he hath ‘scaped us who should be our prey — **  
**O’ermastered by slumber we sank, and our quarry hath stolen away\!**  
**Thou, child of the high God Zeus, Apollo, hast robbed us and wronged;**  
**Thou, a youth, hast down-trodden the right that to godship more ancient belonged;**  
**Thou hast cherished thy suppliant man; the slayer, the God-forsaken,**  
**The bane of a parent, by craft from out of our grasp thou hast taken;**  
**A god, thou hast stolen from us, the avengers, a matricide son — **  
**And who shall consider thy deed and say, *It is rightfully done?***  
**The sound of chiding scorn**  
**Came from the land of dream;**  
**Deep to mine inmost heart I felt it thrill and burn,**  
**Thrust as a strong-grasped goad, to urge**  
**Onward the chariot’s team.**  
**Thrilled, chilled with bitter inward pain**  
**I stand as one beneath the doomsman’s scourge.**  
**Shame on the younger gods who tread down right,**  
**Sitting on thrones of might\!**  
**Woe on the altar of earth’s central fane\!**  
**Clotted on step and shrine,**  
**Behold, the guilt of blood, the ghastly stain\!**  
**Woe upon thee, Apollo\! uncontrolled,**  
**Unbidden, hast thou, prophet-god, imbrued**  
**The pure prophetic shrine with wrongful blood\!**  
**For thou too heinous a respect didst hold**  
**Of man, too little heed of powers divine\!**  
**And us the Fates, the ancients of the earth,**  
**Didst deem as nothing worth.**  
**Scornful to me thou art, yet shalt not fend**  
**My wrath from him; though unto hell he flee,**  
**There too are we\!**  
**And he, the blood-defiled, should feel and rue,**  
**Though I were not, fiend-wrath that shall not end,**  
**Descending on his head who foully slew.  \[*Re — enter Apollo from the inner shrine.*

 

APOLLO**  
**Out\! I command you. Out from this my home — **  
**Haste, tarry not\! Out from the mystic shrine,**  
**Lest thy lot be to take into thy breast**  
**The winged bright dart that from my golden string**  
**Speeds hissing as a snake, — lest, pierced and thrilled**  
**With agony, thou shouldst spew forth again**  
**Black frothy heart’s-blood, drawn from mortal men,**  
**Belching the gory clots sucked forth from wounds.**  
**These be no halls where such as you can prowl — **  
**Go where men lay on men the doom of blood,**  
**Heads lopped from necks, eyes from their spheres plucked out,**  
**Hacked flesh, the flower of youthful seed crushed out,**  
**Feet hewn away, and hands, and death beneath**  
**The smiting stone, low moans and piteous**  
**Of men impaled — Hark, hear ye for what feast**  
**Ye hanker ever, and the loathing gods**  
**Do spit upon your craving? Lo, your shape**  
**Is all too fitted to your greed; the cave**  
**Where lurks some lion, lapping gore, were home**  
**More meet for you. Avaunt from sacred shrines,**  
**Nor bring pollution by your touch on all**  
**That nears you. Hence\! and roam unshepherded — **  
**No god there is to tend sn\]uch herd as you.

 

CHORUS**  
**O king Apollo, in our turn hear us.**  
**Thou hast not only part in these ill things,**  
**But art chief cause and doer of the same.

 

APOLLO**  
**How? stretch thy speech to tell this, and have done.

 

CHORUS**  
**Thine oracle bade this man slay his mother.

 

APOLLO**  
**I bade him quit his sire’s death, — wherefore not?

 

CHORUS**  
**Then didst thou aid and guard red-handed crime.

 

APOLLO**  
**Yea, and I bade him to this temple flee.

 

CHORUS**  
**And yet forsooth dost chide us following him\!

 

APOLLO**  
**Ay — not for you it is, to near this fane.

 

CHORUS**  
**Yet is such office ours, imposed by fate.

 

APOLLO**  
**What office? vaunt the thing ye deem so fair.

 

CHORUS**  
**From home to home we chase the matricide.

 

APOLLO**  
**What? to avenge a wife who slays her lord?

 

CHORUS**  
**That is not blood outpoured by kindred hands.

 

APOLLO**  
**How darkly ye dishonour and annul**  
**The troth to which the high accomplishers,**  
**Hera and Zeus, do honour. Yea, and thus**  
**Is Aphrodite to dishonour cast,**  
**The queen of rapture unto mortal men.**  
**Know that above the marriage-bed ordained**  
**For man and woman standeth Right as guard,**  
**Enhancing sanctity of troth-plight sworn;**  
**Therefore, if thou art placable to those**  
**Who have their consort slain, nor will’st to turn**  
**On them the eye of wrath, unjust art thou**  
**In hounding to his doom the man who slew**  
**His mother. Lo, I know thee full of wrath**  
**Against one deed, but all too placable**  
**Unto the other, minishing the crime.**  
**But in this cause shall Pallas guard the right.

 

CHORUS**  
**Deem not my quest shall ever quit that man.

 

APOLLO**  
**Follow then, make thee double toil in vain\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Think not by speech mine office to curtail.

 

APOLLO**  
**None hast thou, that I would accept of thee\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Yea, high thine honour by the throne of Zeus:**  
**But I, drawn on by scent of mother’s blood,**  
**Seek vengeance on this man and hound him down.

 

APOLLO**  
**But I will stand beside him; ’tis for me**  
**To guard my suppliant: gods and men alike**  
**Do dread the curse of such an one betrayed,**  
**And in me Fear and Will say, *Leave him not.*  \[*Exeunt omnes.***  
***The scene changes to Athens. In the foreground, the Temple of Athena on the Acropolis; her statue stands in the centre; Orestes is seen clinging to it.*

 

ORESTES**  
**Look on me, queen Athena; lo, I come**  
**By Loxias’ behest; thou of thy grace**  
**Receive me, driven of avenging powers — **  
**Not now a red — hand slayer unannealed,**  
**But with guilt fading, half effaced, outworn**  
**On many homes and paths of mortal men.**  
**For to the limit of each land, each sea,**  
**I roamed, obedient to Apollo’s hest,**  
**And come at last, O Goddess, to thy fane,**  
**And clinging to thine image, bide my doom.  \[*Enter the Chorus of Furies, questing like hounds.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Ho\! clear is here the trace of him we seek:**  
**Follow the track of blood, the silent sign\!**  
**Like to some hound that hunts a wounded fawn,**  
**We snuff along the scent of dripping gore,**  
**And inwardly we pant, for many a day**  
**Toiling in chase that shall fordo the man;**  
**For o’er and o’er the wide land have I ranged,**  
**And o’er the wide sea, flying without wings,**  
**Swift as a sail I pressed upon his track,**  
**Who now hard by is crouching, well I wot,**  
**For scent of mortal blood allures me here.**  
**Follow, seek him — round and round**  
**Scent and snuff and scan the ground,**  
**Lest unharmed he slip away,**  
**He who did his mother slay\!**  
**Hist — he is there\! See him his arms entwine**  
**Around the image of the maid divine — **  
**Thus aided, for the deed he wrought**  
**Unto the judgment wills he to be brought.**  
**It may not be\! a mother’s blood, poured forth**  
**Upon the stainèd earth,**  
**None gathers up: it lies — bear witness, Hell\! — **  
**For aye indelible\!**  
**And thou who sheddest it shalt give thine own**  
**That shedding to atone\!**  
**Yea, from thy living limbs I suck it out,**  
**Red, clotted, gout by gout, — **  
**A draught abhorred of men and gods; but I**  
**Will drain it, suck thee dry;**  
**Yea, I will waste thee living, nerve and vein;**  
**Yea, for thy mother slain,**  
**Will drag thee downward, there where thou shalt dree**  
**The weird of agony\!**  
**And thou and whatsoe’er of men hath sinned — **  
**Hath wronged or God, or friend,**  
**Or parent, — learn ye how to all and each**  
**The arm of doom can reach\!**  
**Sternly requiteth, in the world beneath,**  
**The judgment-seat of Death;**  
**Yea, Death, beholding every man’s endeavour,**  
**Recordeth it for ever.

 

ORESTES**  
**I, schooled in many miseries, have learnt**  
**How many refuges of cleansing shrines**  
**There be; I know when law alloweth speech**  
**And when imposeth silence. Lo, I stand**  
**Fixed now to speak, for he whose word is wise**  
**Commands the same. Look, how the stain of blood**  
**Is dull upon mine hand and wastes away,**  
**And laved and lost therewith is the deep curse**  
**Of matricide; for while the guilt was new,**  
**’Twas banished from me at Apollo’s hearth,**  
**Atoned and purified by death of swine.**  
**Long were my word if I should sum the tale,**  
**How oft since then among my fellow-men**  
**I stood and brought no curse. Time cleanses all — **  
**Time, the coeval of all things that are.**  
**Now from pure lips, in words of omen fair,**  
**I call Athena, lady of this land,**  
**To come, my champion: so, in aftertime,**  
**She shall not fail of love and service leal,**  
**Not won by war, from me and from my land**  
**And all the folk of Argos, vowed to her.**  
**Now, be she far away in Libyan land**  
**Where flows from Triton’s lake her natal wave, — **  
**Stand she with planted feet, or in some hour**  
**Of rest conceal them, champion of her friends**  
**Where’er she be, — or whether o’er the plain**  
**Phlegræan she look forth, as warrior bold — **  
**I cry to her to come, where’er she be**  
**\(And she, as goddess, from afar can hear\),**  
**And aid and free me, set among my foes.

 

CHORUS**  
**Thee not Apollo nor Athena’s strength**  
**Can save from perishing, a castaway**  
**Amid the Lost, where no delight shall meet**  
**Thy soul — a bloodless prey of nether powers,**  
**A shadow among shadows. Answerest thou**  
**Nothing? dost cast away my words with scorn,**  
**Thou, prey prepared and dedicate to me?**  
**Not as a victim slain upon the shrine,**  
**But living shalt thou see thy flesh my food.**  
**Hear now the binding chant that makes thee mine.**  
**Weave the weird dance, — behold the hour**  
**To utter forth the chant of hell,**  
**Our sway among mankind to tell,**  
**The guidance of our power.**  
**Of Justice are we ministers,**  
**And whosoe’er of men may stand**  
**Lifting a pure unsullied hand,**  
**That man no doom of ours incurs,**  
**And walks thro’ all his mortal path**  
**Untouched by woe, unharmed by wrath.**  
**But if, as yonder man, he hath**  
**Blood on the hands he strives to hide,**  
**We stand avengers at his side,**  
**Decreeing, *Thou hast wronged the dead:***  
***We are doom’s witnesses to thee.***  
**The price of blood his hands have shed,**  
**We wring from him; in life, in death,**  
**Hard at his side are we\!**  
**Night, Mother Night, who brought me forth, a torment**  
**To living men and dead,**  
**Hear me, O hear\! by Leto’s stripling son**  
**I am dishonoured:**  
**He hath ta’en from me him who cowers in refuge,**  
**To me made consecrate, — **  
**A rightful victim, him who slew his mother,**  
**Given o’er to me and Fate.**  
**Hear the hymn of hell,**  
**O’er the victim sounding, — **  
**Chant of frenzy, chant of ill,**  
**Sense and will confounding\!**  
**Round the soul entwining**  
**Without lute or lyre — **  
**Soul in madness pining,**  
**Wasting as with fire\!**  
**Fate, all — pervading Fate, this service spun, commanding**  
**That I should bide therein:**  
**Whosoe’er of mortals, made perverse and lawless,**  
**Is stained with blood of kin,**  
**By his side are we, and hunt him ever onward,**  
**Till to the Silent Land,**  
**The realm of death, he cometh; neither yonder**  
**In freedom shall he stand.**  
**Hear the hymn of hell,**  
**O’er the victim sounding, — **  
**Chant of frenzy, chant of ill,**  
**Sense and will confounding\!**  
**Round the soul entwining**  
**Without lute or lyre — **  
**Soul in madness pining,**  
**Wasting as with fire\!**  
**When from womb of Night we sprang, on us this labour**  
**Was laid and shall abide.**  
**Gods immortal are ye, yet beware ye touch not**  
**That which is our pride\!**  
**None may come beside us gathered round the blood feast — **  
**For us no garments white**  
**Gleam on a festal day; for us a darker fate is,**  
**Another darker rite.**  
**That is mine hour when falls an ancient line — **  
**When in the household’s heart**  
**The god of blood doth slay by kindred hands, — **  
**Then do we bear our part:**  
**On him who slays we sweep with chasing cry:**  
**Though he be triply strong,**  
**We wear and waste him; blood atones for blood,**  
**New pain for ancient wrong.**  
**I hold this task— ’tis mine, and not another’s.**  
**The very gods on high,**  
**Though they can silence and annul the prayers**  
**Of those who on us cry,**  
**They may not strive with us who stand apart,**  
**A race by Zeus abhorred,**  
**Blood-boltered, held unworthy of the council**  
**And converse of heaven’s lord.**  
**Therefore the more I leap upon my prey;**  
**Upon their head I bound;**  
**My foot is hard; as one that trips a runner**  
**I cast them to the ground;**  
**Yea, to the depth of doom intolerable;**  
**And they who erst were great,**  
**And upon earth held high their pride and glory,**  
**Are brought to low estate,**  
**In underworld they waste and are diminished,**  
**The while around them fleet**  
**Dark wavings of my robes, and, subtly woven,**  
**The paces of my feet.**  
**Who falls infatuate, he sees not, neither knows he**  
**That we are at his side;**  
**So closely round about him, darkly flitting,**  
**The cloud of guilt doth glide.**  
**Heavily ’tis uttered, how around his hearthstone**  
**The mirk of hell doth rise.**  
**Stern and fixed the law is; we have hands t’ achieve it,**  
**Cunning to devise.**  
**Queens are we and mindful of our solemn vengeance.**  
**Not by tear or prayer**  
**Shall a man avert it. In unhonoured darkness,**  
**Far from gods, we fare,**  
**Lit unto our task with torch of sunless regions,**  
**And o’er a deadly way — **  
**Deadly to the living as to those who see not**  
**Life and light of day — **  
**Hunt we and press onward. Who of mortals hearing**  
**Doth not quake for awe,**  
**Hearing all that Fate thro’ hand of God hath given us**  
**For ordinance and law?**  
**Yea, this right to us, in dark abysm and backward**  
**Of ages it befel:**  
**None shall wrong mine office, tho’ in nether regions**  
**And sunless dark I dwell.  \[*Enter Athena from above.*

 

ATHENA**  
**Far off I heard the clamour of your cry,**  
**As by Scamander’s side I set my foot**  
**Asserting right upon the land given o’er**  
**To me by those who o’er Achaia’s host**  
**Held sway and leadership: no scanty part**  
**Of all they won by spear and sword, to me**  
**They gave it, land and all that grew thereon,**  
**As chosen heirloom for my Theseus’ clan.**  
**Thence summoned, sped I with a tireless foot, — **  
**Hummed on the wind, instead of wings, the fold**  
**Of this mine ægis, by my feet propelled,**  
**As, linked to mettled horses, speeds a car.**  
**And now, beholding here Earth’s nether brood,**  
**I fear it nought, yet are mine eyes amazed**  
**With wonder. Who are ye? of all I ask,**  
**And of this stranger to my statue clinging.**  
**But ye — your shape is like no human form,**  
**Like to no goddess whom the gods behold,**  
**Like to no shape which mortal women wear.**  
**Yet to stand by and chide a monstrous form**  
**Is all unjust — from such words Right revolts.

 

CHORUS**  
**O child of Zeus, one word shall tell thee all.**  
**We are the children of eternal Night,**  
**And Furies in the underworld are called.

 

ATHENA**  
**I know your lineage now and eke your name.

 

CHORUS**  
**Yea, and eftsoons indeed my rights shalt know.

 

ATHENA**  
**Fain would I learn them; speak them clearly forth.

 

CHORUS**  
**We chase from home the murderers of men.

 

ATHENA**  
**And where at last can he that slew make pause?

 

CHORUS**  
**Where this is law — *All joy abandon here.*

 

ATHENA**  
**Say, do ye bay this man to such a flight?

 

CHORUS**  
**Yea, for of choice he did his mother slay.

 

ATHENA**  
**Urged by no fear of other wrath and doom?

 

CHORUS**  
**What spur can rightly goad to matricide?

 

ATHENA**  
**Two stand to plead — one only have I heard.

 

CHORUS**  
**He will not swear nor challenge us to oath.

 

ATHENA**  
**The form of justice, not its deed, thou willest.

 

CHORUS**  
**Prove thou that word; thou art not scant of skill.

 

ATHENA**  
**I say that oaths shall not enforce the wrong.

 

CHORUS**  
**Then test the cause, judge and award the right.

 

ATHENA**  
**Will ye to me then this decision trust?

 

CHORUS**  
**Yea, reverencing true child of worthy sire.

 

ATHENA \(to Orestes\)**  
**O man unknown, make thou thy plea in turn.**  
**Speak forth thy land, thy lineage, and thy woes;**  
**The, if thou canst, avert this bitter blame — **  
**If, as I deem, in confidence of right**  
**Thou sittest hard beside my holy place,**  
**Clasping this statue, as Ixion sat,**  
**A sacred suppliant for Zeus to cleanse, — **  
**To all this answer me in words made plain.

 

ORESTES**  
**O queen Athena, first from thy last words**  
**Will I a great solicitude remove.**  
**Not one blood-guilty am I no foul stain**  
**Clings to thine image from my clinging hand;**  
**Whereof one potent proof I have to tell.**  
**Lo, the law stands — *The slayer shall not plead,***  
***Till by the hand of him who cleanses blood***  
***A suckling creature’s blood besprinkle him.***  
**Long since have I this expiation done, — **  
**In many a home, slain beasts and running streams**  
**Have cleansed me. Thus I speak away that fear.**  
**Next, of my lineage quickly thou shalt learn:**  
**An Argive am I, and right well thou know’st**  
**My sire, that Agamemnon who arrayed**  
**The fleet and them that went therein to war — **  
**That chief with whom thy hand combined to crush**  
**To an uncitied heap what once was Troy;**  
**That Agamemnon, when he homeward came,**  
**Was brought unto no honourable death,**  
**Slain by the dark-souled wife who brought me forth**  
**To him, — enwound and slain in wily nets,**  
**Blazoned with blood that in the laver ran.**  
**And I, returning from an exiled youth,**  
**Slew her, my mother — lo, it stands avowed\!**  
**With blood for blood avenging my loved sire;**  
**And in this deed doth Loxias bear part,**  
**Decreeing agonies, to goad my will,**  
**Unless by me the guilty found their doom.**  
**Do thou decide if right or wrong were done — **  
**Thy dooming, whatsoe’er it be, contents me.

 

ATHENA**  
**Too mighty is this matter, whatsoe’er**  
**Of mortals claims to judge hereof aright.**  
**Yea, me, even me, eternal Right forbids**  
**To judge the issues of blood-guilt, and wrath**  
**That follows swift behind. This too gives pause,**  
**That thou as one with all due rites performed**  
**Dost come unsinning, pure, unto my shrine.**  
**Whate’er thou art, in this my city’s name,**  
**As uncondemned, I take thee to my side. — **  
**Yet have these foes of thine such dues by fate,**  
**I may not banish them: and if they fail,**  
**O’erthrown in judgment of the cause, forthwith**  
**Their anger’s poison shall infect the land — **  
**A dropping plague-spot of eternal ill.**  
**Thus stand we with a woe on either hand:**  
**Stay they, or go at my commandment forth,**  
**Perplexity or pain must needs befal.**  
**Yet, as on me Fate hath imposed the cause,**  
**I choose unto me judges that shall be**  
**An ordinance for ever, set to rule**  
**The dues of blood-guilt, upon oath declared.**  
**But ye, call forth your witness and your proof,**  
**Words strong for justice, fortified by oath;**  
**And I, whoe’er are truest in my town,**  
**Them will I choose and bring, and straitly charge,**  
***Look on this cause, discriminating well,***  
***And pledge your oath to utter nought of wrong.*  \[*Exit Athena.*

 

CHORUS**  
**Now are they all undone, the ancient laws,**  
**If here the slayer’s cause**  
**Prevail; new wrong for ancient right shall be**  
**If matricide go free.**  
**Henceforth a deed like his by all shall stand,**  
**Too ready to the hand:**  
**Too oft shall parents in the aftertime**  
**Rue and lament this crime, — **  
**Taught, not in false imagining, to feel**  
**Their children’s thrusting steel:**  
**No more the wrath that erst on murder fell**  
**From us, the queens of hell,**  
**Shall fall, no more our watching gaze impend — **  
**Death shall smite unrestrained.**  
**Henceforth shall one unto another cry,**  
***Lo, they are stricken, lo, they fall and die***  
***Around me\!* and that other answers him,**  
***O thou that lookest that thy woes should cease,***  
***Behold, with dark increase***  
***They throng and press upon thee; yea, and dim***  
***Is all the cure, and every comfort vain\!***  
**Let none henceforth cry out, when falls the blow**  
**Of sudden — smiting woe,**  
**Cry out, in sad reiterated strain,

 

*O Justice, aid\! aid, O ye thrones of hell\!***  
**So though a father or a mother wail**  
**New-smitten by a son, it shall no more avail,**  
**Since, overthrown by wrong, the fane of Justice fell\!**  
**Know that a throne there is that may not pass away,**  
**And one that sitteth on it — even Fear,**  
**Searching with steadfast eyes man’s inner soul:**  
**Wisdom is child of pain, and born with many a tear;**  
**But who henceforth,**  
**What man of mortal men, what nation upon earth,**  
**That holdeth nought in awe nor in the light**  
**Of inner reverence, shall worship Right**  
**As in the older day?**  
**Praise not, O man, the life beyond control,**  
**Nor that which bows unto a tyrant’s sway.**  
**Know that the middle way**  
**Is dearest unto God, and they thereon who wend,**  
**They shall achieve the end;**  
**But they who wander or to left or right**  
**Are sinners in his sight.**  
**Take to thy heart this one, this soothfast word — **  
**Of wantonness impiety is sire;**  
**Only from calm control and sanity unstirred**  
**Cometh true weal, the goal of every man’s desire.**  
**Yea, whatsoe’er befal, hold thou this word of mine:**  
***Bow down at Justice’ shrine,***  
***Turn thou thine eyes away from earthly lure,***  
***Nor with a godless foot that altar spurn.***  
**For as thou dost shall Fate do in return,**  
**And the great doom is sure.**  
**Therefore let each adore a parent’s trust,**  
**And each with loyalty revere the guest**  
**That in his halls doth rest.**  
**For whoso uncompelled doth follow what is just,**  
**He ne’er shall be unblest;**  
**Yea, never to the gulf of doom**  
**That man shall come.**  
**But he whose will is set against the gods,**  
**Who treads beyond the law with foot impure,**  
**Till o’er the wreck of Right confusion broods, — **  
**Know that for him, though now he sail secure,**  
**The day of storm shall be; then shall he strive and fail**  
**Down from the shivered yard to furl the sail,**  
**And call on powers that heed him nought, to save,**  
**And vainly wrestle with the whirling wave.**  
**Hot was his heart with pride — **  
***I shall not fall,* he cried.**  
**But him with watching scorn**  
**The god beholds, forlorn,**  
**Tangled in toils of Fate beyond escape,**  
**Hopeless of haven safe beyond the cape — **  
**Till all his wealth and bliss of bygone day**  
**Upon the reef of Rightful Doom is hurled,**  
**And he is rapt away**  
**Unwept, for ever, to the dead forgotten world.  \[*Re-enter Athena, with twelve Athenian citizens.*

 

ATHENA**  
**O herald, make proclaim, bid all men come.**  
**Then let the shrill blast of the Tyrrhene trump,**  
**Fulfilled with mortal breath, thro’ the wide air**  
**Peal a loud summons, bidding all men heed.**  
**For, till my judges fill this judgment-seat,**  
**Silence behoves, — that this whole city learn**  
**What for all time mine ordinance commands,**  
**And these men, that the cause be judged aright.  \[*Apollo approaches.*

 

CHORUS**  
**O king Apollo, rule what is thine own,**  
**But in this thing what share pertains to thee?

 

APOLLO**  
**First, as a witness come I, for this man**  
**Is suppliant of mine by sacred right,**  
**Guest of my holy hearth and cleansed by me**  
**Of blood-guilt: then, to set me at his side**  
**And in his cause bear part, as part I bore**  
**Erst in his deed, whereby his mother fell.**  
**Let whoso knoweth now announce the cause.

 

ATHENA \(*to the Chorus*\)**  
**’Tis I announce the cause — first speech be yours;**  
**For rightfully shall they whose plaint is tried**  
**Tell the tale first and set the matter clear.

 

CHORUS**  
**Though we be many, brief shall be our tale.**  
**\(*To Orestes*\) Answer thou, setting word to match with word;**  
**And first avow — hast thou thy mother slain?

 

ORESTES**  
**I slew her. I deny no word hereof.

 

CHORUS**  
**Three falls decide the wrestle — this is one.

 

ORESTES**  
**Thou vauntest thee — but o’er no final fall.

 

CHORUS**  
**Yet must thou tell the manner of thy deed.

 

ORESTES**  
**Drawn sword in hand, I gashed her neck, ’Tis told.

 

CHORUS**  
**But by those word, whose craft, wert thou impelled?

 

ORESTES**  
**By oracles of him who here attests me.

 

CHORUS**  
**The prophet-god bade thee thy mother slay?

 

ORESTES**  
**Yea, and thro’ him less ill I fared, till now.

 

CHORUS**  
**If the vote grip thee, thou shalt change that word.

 

ORESTES**  
**Strong is my hope; my buried sire shall aid.

 

CHORUS**  
**Go to now, trust the dead, a matricide\!

 

ORESTES**  
**Yea, for in her combined two stains of sin.

 

CHORUS**  
**How? speak this clearly to the judges’ mind.

 

ORESTES**  
**Slaying her husband, she did slay my sire.

 

CHORUS**  
**Therefore thou livest; death assoils her deed.

 

ORESTES**  
**Then while she lived why didst thou hunt her not?

 

CHORUS**  
**She was not kin by blood to him she slew.

 

ORESTES**  
**And I, am I by blood my mother’s kin?

 

CHORUS**  
**O cursed with murder’s guilt, how else wert thou**  
**The burden of her womb? Dost thou forswear**  
**Thy mother’s kinship, closest bond of love?

 

ORESTES**  
**It is thine hour, Apollo — speak the law,**  
**Averring if this deed were justly done;**  
**For done it is, and clear and undenied.**  
**But if to thee this murder’s cause seem right**  
**Or wrongful, speak — that I to these may tell.

 

APOLLO**  
**To you, Athena’s mighty council-court,**  
**Justly for justice will I plead, even I,**  
**The prophet-god, nor cheat you by one word.**  
**For never spare I from my prophet-seat**  
**One word, of man, of woman, or of state,**  
**Save what the Father of Olympian gods**  
**Commanded unto me. I rede you then,**  
**Bethink you of my plea, how strong it stands,**  
**And follow the decree of Zeus, or sire, — **  
**For oaths prevail not over Zeus’ command.

 

CHORUS**  
**Go to; thou sayest that from Zeus befal**  
**The oracle that this Orestes bade**  
**With vengeance quit the slaying of his sire,**  
**And hold as nought his mother’s right of kin\!

 

APOLLO**  
**Yea, for it stands not with a common death,**  
**That he should die, a chieftain and a king**  
**Decked with the sceptre which high heaven confers — **  
**Die, and by female hands, not smitten down**  
**By a far-shooting bow, held stalwartly**  
**By some strong Amazon. Another doom**  
**Was his: O Pallas, hear, and ye who sit**  
**In judgment, to discern this thing aright\! — **  
**She with a specious voice of welcome true**  
**Hailed him, returning from the mighty mart**  
**Where war for life gives fame, triumphant home;**  
**Then o’er the laver, as he bathed himself;**  
**She spread from head to foot a covering net,**  
**And in the endless mesh of cunning robes**  
**Enwound and trapped her lord, and smote him down.**  
**Lo, ye have heard what doom this chieftain met,**  
**The majesty of Greece, the fleets high lord:**  
**Such as I tell it, let it gall your ears,**  
**Who stand as judges to decide this cause.

 

CHORUS**  
**Zeus, as thou sayest, holds a father’s death**  
**As first of crimes, — yet he of his own act**  
**Cast into chains his father, Cronos old:**  
**How suits that deed with that which now ye tell?**  
**O ye who judge, I bid ye mark by words\!

 

APOLLO**  
**O monsters loathed of all, O scorn of gods,**  
**He that hath bound my loose: a cure there is,**  
**Yea, many a plan that can unbind the chain.**  
**But when the thirsty dust sucks up man’s blood**  
**Once shed in death, he shall arise no more.**  
**No chant nor charm for this my Sire hath wrought.**  
**All else there is, he moulds and shifts at will,**  
**Not scant of strength nor breath, whate’er he do.

 

CHORUS**  
**Think yet for what acquittal thou dost plead:**  
**He who hath shed a mother’s kindred blood,**  
**Shall he in Argos dwell, where dwelt his sire?**  
**How shall he stand before the city’s shrines,**  
**How share the clansmen’s holy lustral bowl?

 

APOLLO**  
**This too I answer; mark a soothfast word:**  
**Not the true parent is the woman’s womb**  
**That bears the child; she doth but nurse the seed**  
**New-sown: the male is parent; she for him,**  
**As stranger for a stranger, hoards the germ**  
**Of life, unless the god its promise blight.**  
**And proof hereof before you will I set.**  
**Birth may from fathers, without mothers, be:**  
**See at your side a witness of the same,**  
**Athena, daughter of Olympian Zeus,**  
**Never within the darkness of the womb**  
**Fostered nor fashioned, but a bud more bright**  
**Than any goddess in her breast might bear.**  
**And I, O Pallas, howsoe’er I may,**  
**Henceforth will glorify thy town, thy clan,**  
**And for this end have sent my suppliant here**  
**Unto thy shrine; that he from this time forth**  
**Be loyal unto thee for evermore,**  
**O goddess — queen, and thou unto thy side**  
**Mayst win and hold him faithful, and his line,**  
**And that for aye this pledge and troth remain**  
**To children’s children of Athenian seed.

 

ATHENA**  
**Enough is said; I bid the judges now**  
**With pure intent deliver just award.

 

CHORUS**  
**We too have shot our every shaft of speech,**  
**And now abide to hear the doom of law.

 

ATHENA \(*to Apollo and Orestes*\)**  
**Say, how ordaining shall I ‘scape your blame?

 

APOLLO**  
**I spake, ye heard; enough. O stranger men,**  
**Heed well your oath as ye decide the cause.

 

ATHENA**  
**O men of Athens, ye who first to judge**  
**The law of bloodshed, hear me now ordain.**  
**Here to all time for Ægeus’ Attic host**  
**Shall stand this council-court of judges sworn,**  
**Here the tribunal, set on Ares’ Hill**  
**Where camped of old the tented Amazons,**  
**What time in hate of Theseus they assailed**  
**Athens, and set against her citadel**  
**A counterwork of new sky-pointing towers,**  
**And there to Ares held their sacrifice,**  
**Where now the rock hath name, even Ares’ Hill.**  
**And hence shall Reverence and her kinsman Fear**  
**Pass to each free man’s heart, by day and night**  
**Enjoining, *Thou shalt do no unjust thing,***  
**So long as law stands as it stood of old**  
**Unmarred by civic change. Look you, the spring**  
**Is pure; but foul it once with influx vile**  
**And muddy clay, and none can drink thereof.**  
**Therefore, O citizens, I bid ye bow**  
**In awe to this command, *Let no man live***  
***Uncurbed by law nor curbed by tyranny;***  
**Nor banish ye the monarchy of Awe**  
**Beyond the walls; untouched by fear divine,**  
**No man doth justice in the world of men.**  
**Therefore in purity and holy dread**  
**Stand and revere; so shall ye have and hold**  
**A saving bulwark of the state and land,**  
**Such as no man hath ever elsewhere known,**  
**Nor in far Scythia, nor in Pelops’ realm.**  
**Thus I ordain it now, a council-court**  
**Pure and unsullied by the lust of gain,**  
**Sacred and swift to vengeance, wakeful ever**  
**To champion men who sleep, the country’s guard.**  
**Thus have I spoken, thus to mine own clan**  
**Commended it for ever. Ye who judge,**  
**Arise, take each his vote, mete out the right,**  
**Your oath revering. Lo, my word is said.  \[*The twelve judges come forward, one by one, to the urns of decision; the first votes; as each of the others follows, the Chorus and Apollo speak alternately.*

 

CHORUS**  
**I rede ye well, beware\! nor put to shame,**  
**In aught, this grievous company of hell.

 

APOLLO**  
**I too would warn you, fear mine oracles — **  
**From Zeus they are, — nor make them void of fruit.

 

CHORUS**  
**Presumptuous is thy claim blood-guilt to judge,**  
**And false henceforth thine oracles shall be.

 

APOLLO**  
**Failed then the counsels of my sire, when turned**  
**Ixion, first of slayers, to his side?

 

CHORUS**  
**These are but words; but I, if justice fail me,**  
**Will haunt this land in grim and deadly deed.

 

APOLLO**  
**Scorn of the younger and the elder gods**  
**Art thou: ’tis I that shall prevail anon.

 

CHORUS**  
**Thus didst thou too of old in Pheres’ halls,**  
**O’erreaching Fate to make a mortal deathless,

 

APOLLO**  
**Was it not well my worshipper to aid,**  
**Then most of all when hardest was the need?

 

CHORUS**  
**I say thou didst annul the lots of life,**  
**Cheating with wine the deities of eld.

 

APOLLO**  
**I say thou shalt anon, thy pleadings foiled,**  
**Spit venom vainly on thine enemies.

 

CHORUS**  
**Since this young god o’errides mine ancient right,**  
**I tarry but to claim your law, not knowing**  
**If wrath of mine shall blast your state or spare.

 

ATHENA**  
**Mine is the right to add the final vote,**  
**And I award it to Orestes’ cause.**  
**For me no mother bore within her womb,**  
**And, save for wedlock evermore eschewed,**  
**I vouch myself the champion of the man,**  
**Not of the woman, yea, with all my soul, — **  
**In heart, as birth, a father’s child alone.**  
**Thus will I not too heinously regard**  
**A woman’s death who did her husband slay,**  
**The guardian of her home; and if the votes**  
**Equal do fall, Orestes shall prevail.**  
**Ye of the judges who are named thereto,**  
**Swiftly shake forth the lots from either urn.  \[*Two judges come forward, one to each urn.*

 

ORESTES**  
**O bright Apollo, what shall be the end?

 

CHORUS

O Night, dark mother mine, dost mark these things?

 

ORESTES**  
**Now shall my doom be life or strangling cords.

 

CHORUS**  
**And mine, lost honour or a wider sway.

 

APOLLO**  
**O stranger judges, sum aright the count**  
**Of votes cast forth, and, parting them, take heed**  
**Ye err not in decision. The default**  
**Of one vote only bringeth ruin deep;**  
**One, cast aright, doth stablish house and home.

 

ATHENA**  
**Behold, this man is free from guilt of blood,**  
**For half the votes condemn him, half set free\!

 

ORESTES

O Pallas, light and safety of my home,**  
**Thou, thou hast given me back to dwell once more**  
**In that my fatherland, amerced of which**  
**I wandered; now shall Grecian lips say this,**  
***The man is Argive once again, and dwells***  
***Again within his father’s wealthy hall,***  
***By Pallas saved, by Loxias, and by Him,***  
***The great third saviour, Zeus omnipotent — ***  
**Who thus in pity for my father’s fate**  
**Doth pluck me from my doom, beholding these,**  
**Confederates of my mother. Lo, I pass**  
**To mine own home, but proffering this vow**  
**Unto thy land and people: *Nevermore,***  
***Thro’ all the manifold years of Time to be,***  
***Shall any chieftain of mine Argive land***  
***Bear hitherward his spears for fight arrayed.***  
**For we, though lapped in earth we then shall lie,**  
**By thwart adversities will work our will**  
**On them who shall transgress this oath of mine,**  
**Paths of despair and journeyings ill-starred**  
**For them ordaining, till their task they rue.**  
**But if this oath be rightly kept, to them**  
**Will we, the dead, be full of grace, the while**  
**With loyal league they honour Pallas’ town.**  
**And now farewell, thou and thy city’s folk — **  
**Firm be thine arms’ grasp, closing with thy foes,**  
**And, strong to save, bring victory to thy spear.  \[*Exit Orestes, with Apollo.*

 

CHORUS**  
**    Woe on you, younger gods\! the ancient right**  
**Ye have o’erridden, rent it from my hands.**  
**I am dishonoured of you, thrust to scorn\!**  
**But heavily my wrath**  
**Shall on this land fling forth the drops that blast and burn.**  
**Venom of vengeance, that shall work such scathe**  
**As I have suffered; where that dew shall fall,**  
**Shall leafless blight arise.**  
**Wasting Earth’s offspring, — Justice, hear my call\! — **  
**And thorough all the land in deadly wise**  
**Shall scatter venom, to exude again**  
**In pestilence of men.**  
**What cry avails me now, what deed of blood,**  
**Unto this land what dark despite?**  
**Alack, alack, forlorn**  
**Are we, a bitter injury have borne\!**  
**Alack, O sisters, O dishonoured brood**  
** Of mother Night\!

 

ATHENA**  
**Nay, bow ye to my words, chafe not nor moan:**  
**Ye are not worsted nor disgraced; behold,**  
**With balanced vote the cause had issue fair,**  
**Nor in the end did aught dishonour thee.**  
**But thus the will of Zeus shone clearly forth,**  
**And his own prophet — god avouched the same,**  
***Orestes slew: his slaying is atoned.***  
**Therefore I pray you, not upon this land**  
**Shoot forth the dart of vengeance; be appeased,**  
**Nor blast the land with blight, nor loose thereon**  
**Drops of eternal venom, direful darts**  
**Wasting and marring nature’s seed of growth.**  
**For I, the queen of Athens’ sacred right,**  
**Do pledge to you a holy sanctuary**  
**Deep in the heart of this my land, made just**  
**By your indwelling presence, while ye sit**  
**Hard by your sacred shrines that gleam with oil**  
**Of sacrifice, and by this folk adored.

 

CHORUS**  
**    Woe on you, younger gods\! the ancient right**  
**Ye have o’erridden, rent it from my hands.**  
**I am dishonoured of you, thrust to scorn\!**  
**But heavily my wrath**  
**Shall on this land fling forth the drops that blast and burn.**  
**Venom of vengeance, that shall work such scathe**  
**As I have suffered; where that dew shall fall,**  
**Shall leafless blight arise.**  
**Wasting Earth’s offspring, — Justice, hear my call\! — **  
**And thorough all the land in deadly wise**  
**Shall scatter venom, to exude again**  
**In pestilence of men.**  
**What cry avails me now, what deed of blood,**  
**Unto this land what dark despite?**  
**Alack, alack, forlorn**  
**Are we, a bitter injury have borne\!**  
**Alack, O sisters, O dishonoured brood**  
** Of mother Night\!

 

ATHENA**  
**Dishonoured are ye not; turn not, I pray,**  
**As goddesses your swelling wrath on men,**  
**Nor make the friendly earth despiteful to them.**  
**I too have Zeus for champion— ’tis enough — **  
**I only of all goddesses do know**  
**To ope the chamber where his thunderbolts**  
**Lie stored and sealed; but here is no such need.**  
**Nay, be appeased, nor cast upon the ground**  
**The malice of thy tongue, to blast the world;**  
**Calm thou thy bitter wrath’s black inward surge,**  
**For high shall be thine honour, set beside me**  
**For ever in this land, whose fertile lap**  
**Shall pour its teeming firstfruits unto you,**  
**Gifts for fair childbirth and for wedlock’s crown:**  
**Thus honoured, praise my spoken pledge for aye.

 

CHORUS**  
**I, I dishonoured in this earth to dwell, — **  
**Ancient of days and wisdom\! I breathe forth**  
**Poison and breath of frenzied ire. O Earth,**  
**Woe, woe for thee, for me\!**  
**From side to side what pains be these that thrill?**  
**Hearken, O mother Night, my wrath, mine agony\!**  
**Whom from mine ancient rights the gods have thrust,**  
**And brought me to the dust — **  
**Woe, woe is me\! — with craft invincible.

 

ATHENA**  
**Older art thou than I, and I will bear**  
**With this thy fury. Know, although thou be**  
**More wise in ancient wisdom, yet have I**  
**From Zeus no scanted measure of the same,**  
**Wherefore take heed unto this prophecy — **  
**If to another land of alien men**  
**Ye go, too late shall ye feel longing deep**  
**For mine. The rolling tides of time bring round**  
**A day of brighter glory for this town;**  
**And thou, enshrined in honour by the halls**  
**Where dwelt Erechtheus, shalt a worship win**  
**From men and from the train of womankind,**  
**Greater than any tribe elsewhere shall pay.**  
**Cast thou not therefore on this soil of mine**  
**Whetstones that sharpen souls to bloodshedding,**  
**The burning goads of youthful hearts, made hot**  
**With frenzy of the spirit, not of wine.**  
**Nor pluck as ‘twere the heart from cocks that strive,**  
**To set it in the breasts of citizens**  
**Of mine, a war-god’s spirit, keen for fight,**  
**Made stern against their country and their kin.**  
**The man who grievously doth lust for fame,**  
**War, full, immitigable, let him wage**  
**Against the stranger; but of kindred birds**  
**I hold the challenge hateful. Such the boon**  
**I proffer thee — within this land of lands,**  
**Most loved of gods, with me to show and share**  
**Fair mercy, gratitude and grace as fair.

 

CHORUS**  
**I, I dishonoured in this earth to dwell, — **  
**Ancient of days and wisdom\! I breathe forth**  
**Poison and breath of frenzied ire. O Earth,**  
**Woe, woe for thee, for me\!**  
**From side to side what pains be these that thrill?**  
**Hearken, O mother Night, my wrath, mine agony\!**  
**Whom from mine ancient rights the gods have thrust,**  
**And brought me to the dust — **  
**Woe, woe is me\! — with craft invincible.

 

ATHENA**  
**I will not weary of soft words to thee,**  
**That never mayst thou say, *Behold me spurned,***  
***An elder by a younger deity,***  
***And from this land rejected and forlorn,***  
***Unhonoured by the men who dwell therein.***  
**But, if Persuasion’s grace be sacred to thee,**  
**Soft in the soothing accents of my tongue,**  
**Tarry, I pray thee; yet, if go thou wilt,**  
**Not rightfully wilt thou on this my town**  
**Sway down the scale that beareth wrath and teen**  
**Or wasting plague upon this folk. ’Tis thine,**  
**If so thou wilt, inheritress to be**  
**Of this my land, its utmost grace to win.

 

CHORUS**  
**O queen, what refuge dost thou promise me?

 

ATHENA**  
**Refuge untouched by bale: take thou my boon.

 

CHORUS**  
**What, if I take it, shall mine honour be?

 

ATHENA**  
**No house shall prosper without grace of thine.

 

CHORUS**  
**Canst thou achieve and grant such power to me?

 

ATHENA**  
**Yea, for my hand shall bless thy worshippers.

 

CHORUS**  
**And wilt thou pledge me this for time eterne?

 

ATHENA**  
**Yea: none can bid me pledge beyond my power.

 

CHORUS**  
**Lo, I desist from wrath, appeased by thee.

 

ATHENA**  
**Then in the land’s heart shalt thou win thee friends.

 

CHORUS**  
**What chant dost bid me raise, to greet the land?

 

ATHENA**  
**Such as aspires towards a victory**  
**Unrued by any: chants from breast of earth,**  
**From wave, from sky; and let the wild winds’ breath**  
**Pass with soft sunlight o’er the lap of land, — **  
**Strong wax the fruits of earth, fair teem the kine,**  
**Unfailing, for my town’s prosperity,**  
**And constant be the growth of mortal seed.**  
**But more and more root out the impious,**  
**For as a gardener fosters what he sows,**  
**So foster I this race, whom righteousness**  
**Doth fend from sorrow. Such the proffered boon.**  
**But I, if wars must be, and their loud clash**  
**And carnage, for my town, will ne’er endure**  
**That aught but victory shall crown her fame.

 

CHORUS**  
**    Lo, I accept it; at her very side**  
**Doth Pallas bid me dwell:**  
**I will not wrong the city of her pride,**  
**Which even Almighty Zeus and Ares hold**  
**Heaven’s earthly citadel,**  
**Loved home of Grecian gods, the young, the old,**  
**The sanctuary divine,**  
**The shield of every shrine\!**  
**For Athens I say forth a gracious prophecy, — **  
**The glory of the sunlight and the skies**  
**Shall bid from earth arise**  
**Warm wavelets of new life and glad prosperity.

 

ATHENA**  
**    Behold, with gracious heart well pleased**  
**I for my citizens do grant**  
**Fulfilment of this covenant:**  
**And here, their wrath at length appeased,**  
**These mighty deities shall stay,**  
**For theirs it is by right to sway**  
**The lot that rules our mortal day,**  
**And he who hath not inly felt**  
**Their stern decree, ere long on him,**  
**Not knowing why and whence, the grim**  
**Life-crushing blow is dealt.**  
**The father’s sin upon the child**  
**Descends, and sin is silent death,**  
**And leads him on the downward path,**  
**By stealth beguiled,**  
**Unto the Furies: though his state**  
**On earth were high, and loud his boast,**  
**Victim of silent ire and hate**  
**He dwells among the Lost.

 

CHORUS**  
**To my blessing now give ear. — **  
**Scorching blight nor singèd air**  
**Never blast thine olives fair\!**  
**Drouth, that wasteth bud and plant,**  
**Keep to thine own place. Avaunt,**  
**Famine fell, and come not hither**  
**Stealthily to waste and wither\!**  
**Let the land, in season due,**  
**Twice her waxing fruits renew;**  
**Teem the kine in double measure;**  
**Rich in new god-given treasure;**  
**Here let men the powers adore**  
**For sudden gifts unhoped before\!

 

ATHENA**  
**  O hearken, warders of the wall**  
**That guards mine Athens, what a dower**  
**Is unto her ordained and given\!**  
**For mighty is the Furies’ power,**  
**And deep-revered in courts of heaven**  
**And realms of hell; and clear to all**  
**They weave thy doom, mortality\!**  
**And some in joy and peace shall sing;**  
**But unto other some they bring**  
**Sad life and tear-dimmed eye.

 

CHORUS**  
**And far away I ban thee and remove,**  
**Untimely death of youths too soon brought low\!**  
**And to each maid, O gods, when time is come for love,**  
**Grant ye a warrior’s heart, a wedded life to know.**  
**Ye too, O Fates, children of mother Night,**  
**Whose children too are we, O goddesses**  
**Of just award, of all by sacred right**  
**Queens, who in time and in eternity**  
**Do rule, a present power for righteousness,**  
**Honoured beyond all gods, hear ye and grant my cry\!

 

ATHENA**  
**And I too, I with joy am fain,**  
**Hearing your voice this gift ordain**  
**Unto my hand. High thanks be thine,**  
**Persuasion, who with eyes divine**  
**Into my tongue didst look thy strength,**  
**To bend and to appease at length**  
**Those who would not be comforted.**  
**Zeus, king of parley, doth prevail,**  
**And ye and I will strive nor fail,**  
**That good may stand in evil’s stead,**  
**And lasting bliss for bale.

 

CHORUS**  
**And nevermore these walls within**  
**Shall echo fierce sedition’s din,**  
**Unslaked with blood and crime;**  
**The thirsty dust shall nevermore**  
**Suck up the darkly streaming gore**  
**Of civic boils, shed out in wrath**  
**And vengeance, crying death for death\!**  
**But man with man and state with state**  
**Shall vow *The pledge of common hate***  
***And common friendship, that for man***  
***Hath oft made blessing out of ban,***  
***Be ours unto all time.*

 

ATHENA**  
**Skill they, or not, the path to find**  
**Of favouring speech and presage kind?**  
**Yea, even from these, who, grim and stern,**  
**Glared anger upon you of old,**  
**O citizens, ye now shall earn**  
**A recompense right manifold.**  
**Deck them aright, extol them high,**  
**Be loyal to their loyalty,**  
**And ye shall make your town and land**  
**Sure, propped on Justice’ saving hand,**  
**And Fame’s eternity.

 

CHORUS**  
**    Hail ye, all hail\! and yet again, all hail,

 

O Athens, happy in a weal secured\!**  
**O ye who sit by Zeus’ right hand, nor fail**  
**Of wisdom set among you and assured,**  
**Loved of the well-loved Goddess-Maid\! the King**  
**Of gods doth reverence you, beneath her guarding wing.

 

ATHENA**  
**All hail unto each honoured guest\!**  
**Whom to the chambers of your rest**  
**’Tis mine to lead, and to provide**  
**The hallowed torch, the guard and guide.**  
**Pass down, the while these altars glow**  
**With sacred fire, to earth below**  
**And your appointed shrine.**  
**There dwelling, from the land restrain**  
**The force of fate, the breath of bane,**  
**But waft on us the gift and gain**  
**Of Victory divine\!**  
**And ye, the men of Cranaos’ seed,**  
**I bid you now with reverence lead**  
**These alien powers that thus are made**  
**Athenian evermore. To you**  
**Fair be their will henceforth, to do**  
**Whate’er may bless and aid\!

 

CHORUS**  
**Hail to you all\! hail yet again,**  
**All who love Athens, gods and men,**  
**Adoring her as Pallas’ home\!**  
**And while ye reverence what ye grant — **  
**My sacred shrine and hidden haunt — **  
**Blameless and blissful be your doom\!

 

ATHENA**  
**Once more I praise the promise of your vows,**  
**And now I bid the golden torches’ glow**  
**Pass down before you to the hidden depth**  
**Of earth, by mine own sacred servants borne,**  
**My loyal guards of statue and of shrine.**  
**Come forth, O flower of Theseus’ Attic land,**  
**O glorious band of children and of wives,**  
**And ye, O train of matrons crowned with eld\!**  
**Deck you with festal robes of scarlet dye**  
**In honour of this day: O gleaming torch,**  
**Lead onward, that these gracious powers of earth**  
**Henceforth be seen to bless the life of men.  \[*Athena leads the procession downwards into the Cave of the Furies, under Areopagus: as they go, the escort of women and children chant aloud.*

 

CHANT**  
**With loyalty we lead you; proudly go,**  
**Night’s childless children, to your home below\!**  
**\(*O citizens, awhile from words forbear\!*\)**  
**To darkness’ deep primeval lair,**  
**Far in Earth’s bosom, downward fare,**  
**Adored with prayer and sacrifice**  
**\(*O citizens, forbear your cries\!*\)**  
**Pass hitherward, ye powers of Dread,**  
**With all your former wrath allayed,**  
**Into the heart of this loved land;**  
**With joy unto your temple wend,**  
**The while upon your steps attend**  
**The flames that fed upon the brand — **  
**\(*Now, now ring out your chant, your joy’s acclaim\!*\)**  
**Behind them, as they downward fare,**  
**Let holy hands libations bear,**  
**And torches’ sacred flame.**  
**All-seeing Zeus and Fate come down**  
**To battle fair for Pallas’ town\!**

## **Prometheus Bound**

![img122.jpg](images/001047.jpg)

 

*E**NTER* HEPHÆSTOS, STRENGTH, *and* FORCE, *leading* PROMETHEUS *in chains* 

 

*Strength*  LO\! to a plain, earth’s boundary remote,**  
**We now are come, — the track as Skythian known,**  
**A desert inaccessible: and now,**  
**Hephæstos, it is thine to do the hests**  
**The Father gave thee, to these lofty crags**  
**To bind this crafty trickster fast in chains**  
**Of adamantine bonds that none can break;**  
**For he, thy choice flower stealing, the bright glory**  
**Of fire that all arts spring from, hath bestowed it**  
**On mortal men. And so for fault like this**  
**He now must pay the Gods due penalty,**  
**That he may learn to bear the sovereign rule**  
**Of Zeus, and cease from his philanthropy.

 

*Heph.*  O Strength, and thou, O Force, the hest of Zeus,**  
**As far as touches you, attains its end,**  
**And nothing hinders. Yet my courage fails**  
**To bind a God of mine own kin by force**  
**To this bare rock where tempests wildly sweep;**  
**And yet I needs must muster courage for it:**  
**’Tis no slight thing the Father’s words to scorn.**  
**O thou of Themis \[*to* PROMETHEUS\] wise in counsel son,**  
**Full deep of purpose, lo\! against my will, **  
**I fetter thee against thy will with bonds**  
**Of bronze that none can loose, the this lone height,**  
**Where thou shalt know nor voice nor face of man,**  
**But scorching in the hot blaze of the sun,**  
**Shalt lose thy skin’s fair beauty. Thou shalt long**  
**For starry-mantled night to hide day’s sheen,**  
**For sun to melt the rime of early dawn;**  
**And evermore the weight of present ill**  
**Shall wear thee down. Unborn as yet is he**  
**Who shall release thee: this the fate thou gain’st**  
**As due reward for thy philanthropy.**  
**For thou, a God not fearing wrath of Gods,**  
**In thy transgression gav’st their power to men;**  
**And therefore on this rock of little ease**  
**Thou still shalt keep thy watch, nor lying down,**  
**Nor knowing sleep, nor ever bending knee;**  
**And many groans and wailings profitless**  
**Thy lips shall utter; for the mind of Zeus**  
**Remains inexorable. Who holds a power**  
**But newly gained  is ever stern of mood.

 

*Strength.*  Let be\! Why linger in this idle pity?**  
**Why dost not hate a God to Gods a foe,**  
**Who gave thy choicest prize to mortal men?

 

*Heph.*  Strange is the power of kin and intercourse. 

 

*Strength.*  I own it; yet to slight the Father’s words,**  
**How may that be? Is not that fear the worse?

 

*Heph.*  Still art thou ruthless, full of savagery.

 

*Strength.*  There is no help in weeping over him:**  
**Spend not thy toil on things that profit not.

 

*Heph.*  O handicraft to me intolerable\!

 

*Strength.*  Why loath’st thou it? Of these thy present griefs**  
**That craft of thine is not one whit the cause.

 

*Heph.*  And yet I would some other had that skill.

 

*Strength.*  All things bring toil except for Gods to reign; **  
**For none but Zeus can boast of freedom true.

 

*Heph.*  Too well I see the proof, and gainsay not.

 

*Strength.*  Wilt thou not speed to fix the chains on him,**  
**Lest He, the Father, see thee loitering here?

 

*Heph.*  Well, here the handcuffs thou mayst see prepared.

 

*Strength.*  In thine hands take him. Then with all thy might**  
**Strike with thine hammer; nail him to the rocks.

 

*Heph.*  The work goes on, I ween, and not in vain.

 

*Strength.*  Strike harder, rivet, give no whit of ease:**  
**A wondrous knack has he to find resource,**  
**Even where all might seem to baffle him.

 

*Heph.*  Lo\! this his arm is fixed inextricably.

 

*Strength.*  Now rivet thou this other fast, that he**  
**May learn, though sharp, that he than Zeus is duller.

 

*Heph.*  No one but he could justly blame my work.

 

*Strength.*  Now drive the stern jaw of the adamant wedge**  
**Right through his chest with all the strength thou hast.

 

*Heph.*  Ah me\! Prometheus, for thy woes I groan.

 

*Strength.*  Again, thou’rt loth, and for the foes of Zeus**  
**Thou groanest: take good heed to it lest thou**  
**Ere long with cause thyself commiserate.

 

*Heph.*  Thou seest a sight unsightly to our eyes.

 

*Strength.*  I see this man obtaining his deserts:**  
**Nay, cast thy breast-chains round about his ribs.

 

*Heph.*  I must needs do it. Spare thine o’ermuch bidding;**  
**Go thou below and rivet both his legs. 

 

*Strength.*  Nay, I will bid thee, urge thee to thy work.

 

*Heph.*  There, it is done, and that with no long toil.

 

*Strength.*  Now with thy full power fix the galling fetters:**  
**Thou hast a stern o’erlooker of thy work.

 

*Heph.*  Thy tongue but utters words that match thy form. 

 

*Strength.*  Choose thou the melting mood; but chide not me**  
**For my self-will and wrath and ruthlessness.

 

*Heph.*  Now let us go, his limbs are bound in chains.

 

*Strength.*  Here then wax proud, and stealing what**  
**belongs**  
**To the Gods, to mortals give it. What can they**  
**Avail to rescue thee from these thy woes?**  
**Falsely the Gods have given thee thy name,**  
**Prometheus, Forethought; forethought thou dost need**  
**To free thyself from this rare handiwork.  \[*Exeunt* HEPHÆSTOS, STRENGTH, *and* FORCE, *leaving* PROMETHEUS *on the rock.*

 

*Prom.*   Thou firmament of God, and swift-winged winds,**  
**Ye springs of rivers, and of ocean waves**  
**That smile innumerous\! Mother of us all,

 

O Earth, and Sun’s all-seeing eye, behold,**  
**I pray, what I, a God, from Gods endure.**  
**Behold in what foul case**  
**I for ten thousand years**  
**Shall struggle in my woe,**  
**In these unseemly chains.**  
**Such doom the new-made Monarch of the Blest**  
**Hath now devised for me.**  
**Woe, woe\! The present and the oncoming pang**  
**I wail, as I search out**  
**The place and hour when end of all these ills**  
**Shall dawn on me at last.**  
**What say I? All too clearly I foresee**  
**The things that come, and nought of pain shall be**  
**By me unlooked-for; but I needs must bear**  
**My destiny as best I may, knowing well**  
**The might resistless of Necessity.**  
**And neither may I speak of this my fate,**  
**Nor hold my peace. For I, poor I, through giving**  
**Great gifts to mortal men, am prisoner made**  
**In these fast fetters; yea, in fennel stalk **  
**I snatched the hidden spring of stolen fire,**  
**Which is to men a teacher of all arts,**  
**Their chief resource. And now this penalty**  
**Of that offence I pay, fast riveted**  
**In chains beneath the open firmament.**  
**Ha\! ha\! What now?**  
**What sound, what odour floats invisibly? **  
**Is it of God or man, or blending both?**  
**And has one come to this remotest rock**  
**To look upon my woes? Or what wills he?**  
**Behold me bound, a God to evil doomed,**  
**The foe of Zeus, and held**  
**In hatred by all Gods**  
**Who tread the courts of Zeus:**  
**And this for my great love,**  
**Too great, for mortal men.**  
**Ah me\! what rustling sounds**  
**Hear I of birds not far?**  
**With the light whirr of wings**  
**The air re-echoeth:**  
**All that draws nigh to me is cause of fear. **  
***Enter Chorus of* Ocean Nymphs, *with wings, floating in the air* 

 

*Chor.*  Nay, fear thou nought: in love**  
**All our array of wings**  
**In eager race hath come**  
**To this high peak, full hardly gaining o’er**  
**Our Father’s mind and will;**  
**And the swift-rushing breezes bore me on:**  
**For lo\! the echoing sound of blows on iron**  
**Pierced to our cave’s recess, and put to flight**  
**My shamefast modesty,**  
**And I in unshod haste, on winged car,**  
**To thee rushed hitherward.

 

*Prom.*  Ah me\! ah me\!**  
**Offspring of Tethys blest with many a child,**  
**Daughters of Old Okeanos that rolls**  
**Round all the earth with never-sleeping stream,**  
**Behold ye me, and see**  
**With what chains fettered fast,**  
**I on the topmost crags of this ravine**  
**Shall keep my sentry-post unenviable.

 

*Chor.*  I see it, O Prometheus, and a mist**  
**Of fear and full of tears comes o’er mine eyes,**  
**Thy frame beholding thus,**  
**Writhing on these high rocks**  
**In adamantine ills.**  
**New pilots now o’er high Olympos rule,**  
**And with new-fashioned laws**  
**Zeus reigns, down-trampling Right,**  
**And all the ancient powers He sweeps away.

 

*Prom.*  Ah\! would that ‘neath the Earth, ‘neath Hades too,**  
**Home of the dead, far down to Tartaros**  
**Unfathomable He in fetters fast**  
**In wrath had hurled me down:**  
**So neither had a God**  
**Nor any other mocked at these my woes;**  
**But now, the wretched plaything of the winds,**  
**I suffer ills at which my foes rejoice.

 

*Chor.*  Nay, which of all the Gods**  
**Is so hard-hearted as to joy in this?**  
**Who, Zeus excepted, doth not pity thee**  
**In these thine ills? But He,**  
**Ruthless, with soul unbent,**  
**Subdues the heavenly host, nor will He cease **  
**Until His heart be satiate with power,**  
**Or some one seize with subtle stratagem**  
**The sovran might that so resistless seemed.

 

*Prom.*  Nay, of a truth, though put to evil shame,**  
**In massive fetters bound,**  
**The Ruler of the Gods**  
**Shall yet have need of me, yes, e’en of me,**  
**To tell the counsel new**  
**That seeks to strip from Him**  
**His sceptre and His might of sovereignty.**  
**In vain will He with words**  
**Or suasion’s honeyed charms**  
**Soothe me, nor will I tell**  
**Through fear of His stern threats,**  
**Ere He shall set me free**  
**From these my bonds, and make,**  
**Of His own choice, amends**  
**For all these outrages.

 

*Chor.*  Full rash art thou, and yield’st**  
**In not a jot to bitterest form of woe;**  
**Thou art o’er-free and reckless in thy speech:**  
**But piercing fear hath stirred**  
**My inmost soul to strife;**  
**For I fear greatly touching thy distress,**  
**As to what haven of these woes of thine**  
**Thou now must steer: the son of Cronos hath**  
**A stubborn mood and heart inexorable.

 

*Prom.*  I know that Zeus is hard,**  
**And keeps the Right supremely to Himself;**  
**But then, I trow, He’ll be**  
**Full pliant in His will,**  
**When He is thus crushed down.**  
**Then, calming down His mood**  
**Of hard and bitter wrath,**  
**He’ll hasten unto me,**  
**As I to Him shall haste,**  
**For friendship and for peace.

 

*Chor.*  Hide it not from us, tell us all the tale:**  
**For what offence Zeus, having seized thee thus,**  
**So wantonly and bitterly insults thee:**  
**If the tale hurt thee not, inform thou us.

 

*Prom.*  Painful are these things to me e’en to speak:**  
**Painful is silence; everywhere is woe.**  
**For when the high Gods fell on mood of wrath**  
**And hot debate of mutual strife was stirred,**  
**Some wishing to hurl Cronos from his throne,**  
**That Zeus, forsooth, might reign; while others strove,**  
**Eager that Zeus might never rule the Gods:**  
**Then I, full strongly seeking to persuade**  
**The Titans, yea, the sons of Heaven and Earth,**  
**Failed of my purpose. Scorning subtle arts,**  
**With counsels violent, they thought that they**  
**By force would gain full easy mastery.**  
**But then not once or twice my mother Themis**  
**And earth, one form though bearing many names, **  
**Had prophesied the future, how ’twould run,**  
**That not by strength nor yet by violence,**  
**But guile, should those who prospered gain the day.**  
**And when in my words I this counsel gave,**  
**They deigned not e’en to glance at it at all.**  
**And then of all that offered, it seemed best**  
**To join my mother, and of mine own will,**  
**Not against His will, take my side with Zeus,**  
**And by my counsels, mine, the dark deep pit**  
**Of Tartaros the ancient Cronos holds,**  
**Himself and his allies. Thus profiting**  
**By me, the mighty ruler of the Gods**  
**Repays me with these evil penalties:**  
**For somehow this disease in sovereignty**  
**Inheres, of never trusting to one’s friends. **  
**And since ye ask me under what pretence**  
**He thus maltreats me, I will show it you:**  
**For soon as He upon His father’s throne**  
**Had sat secure, forthwith to divers Gods**  
**He divers gifts distributed, and His realm**  
**Began to order. But of mortal men**  
**He took no heed, but purposed utterly**  
**To crush their race and plant another new;**  
**And, I excepted, none dared cross His will;**  
**But I did dare, and mortal men I freed**  
**From passing on to Hades thunder-stricken;**  
**And therefore am I bound beneath these woes,**  
**Dreadful to suffer, pitiable to see:**  
**And I, who in my pity thought of men**  
**More than myself, have not been worthy deemed**  
**To gain like favour, but all ruthlessly**  
**I thus am chained, foul shame this sight to Zeus.

 

*Chor.*  Iron-hearted must he be and made of rock**  
**Who is not moved, Prometheus, by thy woes:**  
**Fain could I wish I ne’er had seen such things,**  
**And, seeing them, am wounded to the heart.

 

*Prom.*  Yea, I am piteous for my friends to see.

 

*Chor.*  Didst thou not go to farther lengths than this?

 

*Prom.*  I made men cease from contemplating death. 

 

*Chor.*  What medicine didst thou find for that disease?

 

*Prom.*  Blind hopes I gave to live and dwell with them.

 

*Chor.*  Great service that thou didst for mortal men\!

 

*Prom.*  And more than that, I gave them fire, yes, I.

 

*Chor.*  Do short-lived men the flaming fire possess?

 

*Prom.*  Yea, and full many an art they’ll learn from it.

 

*Chor.*  And is it then on charges such as these**  
**That Zeus maltreats thee, and no respite gives**  
**Of many woes? And has thy pain no end?

 

*Prom.*  End there is none, except as pleases Him.

 

*Chor.*  How shall it please? What hope hast thou?**  
** Seest not**  
**That thou hast sinned? Yet to say how thou sinned’st**  
**Gives me no pleasure, and is pain to thee.**  
**Well\! let us leave these things, and, if we may,**  
**Seek out some means to ‘scape from this thy woe.

 

*Prom.*  ’Tis a light thing for one who has his foot**  
**Beyond the reach of evil to exhort**  
**And counsel him who suffers. This to me**  
**Was all well known. Yea, willing, willingly**  
**I sinned, nor will deny it. Helping men,**  
**I for myself found trouble: yet I thought not**  
**That I with such dread penalties as these**  
**Should wither here on these high-towering crags,**  
**Lighting on this lone hill and neighbourless.**  
**Wherefore wail not for these my present woes,**  
**But, drawing nigh, my coming fortunes hear,**  
**That ye may learn the whole tale to the end.**  
**Nay, hearken, hearken; show your sympathy**  
**With him who suffers now. ’Tis thus that woe,**  
**Wandering, now falls on this one, now on that.

 

*Chor.*  Not to unwilling hearers hast thou uttered,**  
**Prometheus, thy request,**  
**And now with nimble foot abounding**  
**My swiftly rushing car,**  
**And the pure æther, path of birds of heaven,**  
**I will draw near this rough and rocky land,**  
**For much do I desire**  
**To hear this tale, full measure of thy woes.**  
***Enter* OKEANOS, *on a car drawn by a winged gryphon*

 

*Okean.*  Lo, I come to thee, Prometheus,**  
**Reaching goal of distant journey, **  
**Guiding this my winged courser**  
**By my will, without a bridle;**  
**And thy sorrows move my pity.**  
**Force, in part, I deem, of kindred**  
**Leads me on, nor know I any,**  
**Whom, apart from kin, I honour**  
**More than thee, in fuller measure.**  
**This thou shalt own true and earnest:**  
**I deal not in glozing speeches.**  
**Come then, tell me how to help thee;**  
**Ne’er shalt thou say that one more friendly**  
**Is found than unto thee is Okean.

 

*Prom.*  Let be. What boots it? Thou then too art come**  
**To gaze upon my sufferings. How didst dare**  
**Leaving the stream that bears thy name, and caves**  
**Hewn in the living rock, this land to visit,**  
**Mother of iron? What then, art thou come**  
**To gaze upon my fall and offer pity?**  
**Behold this sight: see here the friend of Zeus,**  
**Who helped to seat Him in His sovereignty,**  
**With what foul outrage I am crushed by Him\!

 

*Okean.*  I see, Prometheus, and I wish to give thee**  
**My best advice, all subtle though thou be.**  
**Know thou thyself,  and fit thy soul to moods**  
**To thee full new. New king the Gods have now;**  
**But if thou utter words thus rough and sharp,**  
**Perchance, though sitting far away on high,**  
**Zeus yet may hear thee, and His present wrath**  
**Seem to thee but as child’s play of distress.**  
**Nay, thou poor sufferer, quit the rage thou hast,**  
**And seek a remedy for these thine ills.**  
**A tale thrice-told, perchance I seem to speak:**  
**Lo\! this, Prometheus, is the punishment**  
**Of thine o’erlofty speech, nor art thou yet**  
**Humbled, nor yieldest to thy miseries,**  
**And fain wouldst add fresh evils unto these.**  
**But thou, if thou wilt take me as thy teacher,**  
**Wilt not kick out against the pricks;  seeing well**  
**A monarch reigns who gives account to none.**  
**And now I go, and will an effort make,**  
**If I, perchance, may free thee from thy woes;**  
**Be still then, hush thy petulance of speech,**  
**Or knowest thou not, o’er-clever as thou art,**  
**That idle tongues must still their forfeit pay?

 

*Prom.*  I envy thee, seeing thou art free from blame**  
**Though thou shared’st all, and in my cause wast bold; **  
**Nay, let me be, nor trouble thou thyself;**  
**Thou wilt not, canst not soothe Him; very hard**  
**Is He of soothing. Look to it thyself,**  
**Lest thou some mischief meet with in the way.

 

*Okean.*  It is thy wont thy neighbours’ minds to school**  
**Far better than thine own. From deeds, not words,**  
**I draw my proof. But do not draw me back**  
**When I am hasting on, for lo\! I deem,**  
**I deem that Zeus will grant this boon to me,**  
**That I should free thee from these woes of thine.

 

*Prom.*  I thank thee much, yea, ne’er will cease to thank;**  
**For thou no whit of zeal dost lack; yet take,**  
**I pray, no trouble for me; all in vain**  
**Thy trouble, nothing helping, e’en if thou**  
**Shouldst care to take the trouble. Nay, be still;**  
**Keep out of harm’s way; sufferer though I be,**  
**I would not therefore wish to give my woes**  
**A wider range o’er others. No, not so:**  
**For lo\! my mind is wearied with the grief**  
**Of that my kinsman Atlas,  who doth stand**  
**In the far West, supporting on his shoulders**  
**The pillars of the earth and heaven, a burden**  
**His arms can ill but hold; I pity too**  
**The giant dweller of Kilikian caves,**  
**Dread portent, with his hundred hands, subdued**  
**By force, the mighty Typhon,  who arose**  
**‘Gainst all the Gods, with sharp and dreadful jaws**  
**Hissing out slaughter, and from out his eyes**  
**There flashed the terrible brightness as of one**  
**Who would lay low the sovereignty of Zeus.**  
**But the unsleeping dart of Zeus came on him,**  
**Down-swooping thunderbolt that breathes out flame,**  
**Which from his lofty boastings startled him,**  
**For he i’ the heart was struck, to ashes burnt,**  
**His strength all thunder-shattered; and he lies**  
**A helpless, powerless carcase, near the strait**  
**Of the great sea, fast pressed beneath the roots**  
**Of ancient Ætna, where on highest peak**  
**Hephæstos sits and smites his iron red-hot,**  
**From whence hereafter streams of fire shall burst, **  
**Devouring with fierce jaws the golden plains**  
**Of fruitful, fair Sikelia. Such the wrath**  
**That Typhon shall belch forth with bursts of storm,**  
**Hot, breathing fire, and unapproachable,**  
**Though burnt and charred by thunderbolts of Zeus.**  
**Not inexperienced art thou, nor dost need**  
**My teaching: save thyself, as thou know’st how;**  
**And I will drink my fortune to the dregs,**  
**Till from His wrath the mind of Zeus shall rest. 

 

*Okean.*  Know’st thou not this, Prometheus, even this:**  
**Of wrath’s disease wise words the healers are?

 

*Prom.*  Yea, could one soothe the troubled heart in time,**  
**Nor seek by force to tame the soul’s proud flesh.

 

*Okean.*  But, in due forethought with bold daring blent,**  
**What mischief seest thou lurking? Tell me this.

 

*Prom.*  Toil bootless, and simplicity full fond.

 

*Okean.*  Let me, I pray, that sickness suffer, since**  
**’Tis best being wise to have not wisdom’s show.

 

*Prom.*  Nay, but this error shall be deemed as mine.

 

*Okean.*  Thy word then clearly sends me home at once.

 

*Prom.*  Yea, lest thy pity for me make a foe….

 

*Okean.*  What\! of that new king on His mighty throne?

 

*Prom.*  Look to it, lest His heart be vexed with thee.

 

*Okean.*  Thy fate, Prometheus, teaches me that lesson.

 

*Prom.*  Away, withdraw\! keep thou the mind thou hast.

 

*Okean.*  Thou urgest me who am in act to haste;**  
**For this my bird four-footed flaps with wings**  
**The clear path of the æther; and full fain**  
**Would he bend knee in his own stall at home.**  
**\[*Exit.*

 

STROPHE I

 

*Chor.*  I grieve, Prometheus, for thy dreary fate,**  
**Shedding from tender eyes**  
**The drew of plenteous tears;**  
**With streams, as when the watery south wind blows,**  
**My cheek is wet;**  
**For lo\! these things are all unenviable,**  
**And Zeus, by His own laws His sway maintaining,**  
**Shows to the elder Gods**  
**A mood of haughtiness.

 

ANTISTROPHE I**  
**And all the country echoeth with the moan,**  
**And poureth many a tear**  
**For that magnific power**  
**Of ancient days far-seen that thou didst share**  
**With those of one blood sprung;**  
**And all the mortal men who hold the plain**  
**Of holy Asia as their land of sojourn,**  
**They grieve in sympathy**  
**For thy woes lamentable.

 

STROPHE II**  
**And they, the maiden band who find their home**  
**On distant Colchian coasts,**  
**Fearless of fight, **  
**Or Skythian horde is earth’s remotest clime,**  
**By far Mæotic lake; 

 

ANTISTROPHE II**  
**And warlike glory of Arabia’s tribes, **  
**Who nigh to Caucasos**  
**In rock-fort dwell,**  
**An army fearful, with sharp-pointed spear**  
**Raging in war’s array.

 

STROPHE III**  
**One other Titan only have I seen,**  
**One other of the Gods,**  
**Thus bound in woes of adamantine strength — **  
**Atlas, who ever groans**  
**Beneath the burden of a crushing might,**  
**The outspread vault of heaven.

 

ANTISTROPHE III**  
**And lo\! the ocean billows murmur loud**  
**In one accord with him; **  
**The sea-depths groan, and Hades’ swarthy pit**  
**Re-echoeth the sound,**  
**And fountains of clear rivers, as they flow,**  
**Bewail his bitter griefs.

 

*Prom.*  Think not it is through pride or stiff self-will**  
**That I am silent. But my heart is worn,**  
**Self-contemplating, as I see myself**  
**Thus outraged. Yet what other hand than mine**  
**Gave these young Gods in fulness all their gifts?**  
**But these I speak not of; for I should tell**  
**To you that know them. But those woes of men, **  
**List ye to them, — how they, before as babes,**  
**By me were roused to reason, taught to think;**  
**And this I say, not finding fault with men,**  
**But showing my good-will in all I gave.**  
**For first, though seeing, all in vain they saw,**  
**And hearing, heard not rightly. But, like forms**  
**Of phantom-dreams, throughout their life’s whole length**  
**They muddled all at random; did not know**  
**Houses of brick that catch the sunlight’s warmth,**  
**Nor yet the work of carpentry. They dwelt**  
**In hollowed holes, like swarms of tiny ants,**  
**In sunless depths of caverns; and they had**  
**No certain signs of winter, nor of spring**  
**Flower-laden, nor of summer with her fruits;**  
**But without counsel fared their whole life long,**  
**Until I showed the risings of the stars,**  
**And settings hard to recognise.  And I**  
**Found Number for them, chief devise of all,**  
**Groupings of letters, Memory’s handmaid that,**  
**And mother of the Muses.  And I first**  
**Bound in the yoke wild steeds, submissive made**  
**Or to the collar or men’s limbs, that so**  
**They might in man’s place bear his greatest toils;**  
**And horses trained to love the rein I yoked**  
**To chariots, glory of wealth’s pride of state; **  
**Nor was it any one but I that found**  
**Sea-crossing, canvas-wingèd cars of ships:**  
**Such rare designs inventing \(wretched me\!\)**  
**For mortal men, I yet have no device**  
**By which to free myself from this my woe. 

 

*Chor.*  Foul shame thou sufferest: of thy sense bereaved,**  
**Thou errest greatly: and, like leech unskilled,**  
**Thou losest heart when smitten with disease,**  
**And know’st not how to find the remedies**  
**Wherewith to heal thine own soul’s sicknesses.

 

*Prom.*  Hearing what yet remains, thou’lt wonder more,**  
**What arts and what resources I devised:**  
**And this the chief: if any one fell ill,**  
**There was no help for him, nor healing food**  
**Nor unguent, nor yet potion; but for want**  
**Of drugs they wasted, till I showed to them**  
**The blendings of all mild medicaments, **  
**Wherewith they ward the attacks of sickness sore.**  
**I gave them many modes of prophecy; **  
**And I first taught them what dreams needs must prove**  
**True visions, and made known the ominous sounds**  
**Full hard to know; and tokens by the way,**  
**And flights of taloned birds I clearly marked, — **  
**Those on the right propitious to mankind,**  
**And those sinister, — and what form of life**  
**They each maintain, and what their enmities**  
**Each with the other, and their loves and friendships;**  
**And of the inward parts the plumpness smooth.**  
**And with what colour they the Gods would please,**  
**And the streaked comeliness of gall and liver:**  
**And with burnt limbs enwrapt in fat, and chine,**  
**I led men on to art full difficult:**  
**And I gave eyes to omens drawn from fire,**  
**Till then dim-visioned. So far, then, for this.**  
**And ‘neath the earth the hidden boons for men,**  
**Bronze, iron, silver, gold, who else could say**  
**That he, ere I did, found them? None, I know,**  
**Unless he fain would babble idle words.**  
**In one short word, then, learn the truth condensed, — **  
**All arts of mortals from Prometheus spring.

 

*Chor.*  Nay, be not thou to men so over-kind,**  
**While thou thyself art in sore evil case;**  
**For I am sanguine that thou too, released**  
**From bonds, shalt be as strong as Zeus Himself.

 

*Prom.*  It is not thus that Fate’s decree is fixed;**  
**But I, long crushed with twice ten thousand woes**  
**And bitter pains, shall then escape my bonds;**  
**Art is far weaker than Necessity.

 

*Chor.*  Who guides the helm, then, of Necessity?

 

*Prom.*  Fates triple-formed, Erinyes unforgetting.

 

*Chor.*  Is Zeus, then, weaker in His might than these?

 

*Prom.*  Not even He can ‘scape the thing decreed.

 

*Chor.*  What is decreed for Zeus but still to reign?

 

*Prom.*  Thou mayst no further learn, ask thou no more.

 

*Chor.*  ’Tis doubtless some dread secret which thou hidest.

 

*Prom.*  Of other theme make mention, for the time**  
**Is not yet come to utter this, but still**  
**It must be hidden to the uttermost;**  
**For by thus keeping it it is that I**  
**Escape my bondage foul, and these my pains.

 

STROPHE I

 

*Chor.*  Ah\! ne’er may Zeus the Lord,**  
**Whose sovran sway rules all,**  
**His strength in conflict set**  
**Against my feeble will\!**  
**Nor may I fail to serve**  
**The Gods with holy feast**  
**Of whole burnt — offerings,**  
**Where the stream ever flows**  
**That bears my father’s name,**  
**The great Okeanos\!**  
**Nor may I sin in speech\!**  
**May this grace more and more**  
**Sink deep into my soul**  
**And never fade away\!

 

ANTISTROPHE I**  
**          Sweet is it in strong hope**  
**To spend long years of life,**  
**With bright and cheering joy**  
**Our heart’s thoughts nourishing**  
**I shudder, seeing thee**  
**Thus vexed and harassed sore**  
**By twice ten thousand woes;**  
**For thou in pride of heart,**  
**Having no fear of Zeus,**  
**In thine own obstinacy,**  
**Dost show for mortal men,**  
**Prometheus, love o’ermuch.

 

STROPHE II**  
**          See how that boon, dear friends,**  
**For thee is bootless found.**  
**Say, where is any help?**  
**What aid from mortals comes?**  
**Hast thou not seen this brief and powerless life,**  
**Fleeting as dreams, with which man’s purblind race**  
**Is fast in fetters bound?**  
**Never shall counsels vain**  
**Of mortal men break through**  
**The harmony of Zeus.

 

ANTISTROPHE II**  
**          This lesson have I learnt**  
**Beholding thy sad fate,**  
**Prometheus\! Other strains**  
**Come back upon my mind,**  
**When I sang wedding hymns around thy bath,**  
**And at thy bridal bed, when thou didst take**  
**In wedlock’s holy bands**  
**One of the same sire born,**  
**Our own Hesione,**  
**Persuading her with gifts**  
**As wife to share thy couch.**  
***Enter* IO *in form like a fair woman with a heifer’s horns,*  *followed by the Spectre of* ARGOS

 

*Io.*  What land is this? What people? Whom shall I**  
**Say that I see thus vexed**  
**With bit and curb of rock?**  
**For what offence dost thou**  
**Bear fatal punishment?**  
**Tell me to what far land**  
**I’ve wandered here in woe.**  
**Ah me\! ah me\!**  
**Again the gadfly stings me miserable.**  
**Spectre of Argos, thou, the earth-born one — **  
**Ah, keep him off, O Earth\!**  
**I fear to look upon that herdsman dread,**  
**Him with ten thousand eyes:**  
**Ah lo\! he cometh with his crafty look,**  
**Whom Earth refuses even dead to hold; **  
**But coming from beneath,**  
**He hunts me miserable,**  
**And drives me famished o’er the sea-beach sand.

 

STROPHE**  
**And still his waxened reed-pipe soundeth clear**  
**A soft and slumberous strain;**  
**O heavens\! O ye Gods\!**  
**Whither do these long wanderings lead me on?**  
**For what offence, O son of Cronos, what,**  
**Hast thou thus bound me fast**  
**In these great miseries?**  
**Ah me\! ah me\!**  
**And why with terror of the gadfly’s sting**  
**Dost thou thus vex me, frenzied in my soul?**  
**Burn me with fire, or bury me in earth,**  
**Or to wild sea-beasts give me as a prey:**  
**Nay, grudge me not, O King,**  
**An answer to my prayers:**  
**Enough my many-wandered wanderings**  
**Have exercised my soul,**  
**Nor have I power to learn**  
**How to avert the woe.**  
**\(*To Prometheus.*\) Hear’st thou the voice of maiden crowned with horns?

 

*Prom.*  Surely I heard the maid by gadfly driven,**  
**Daughter of Inachos, who warmed the heart**  
**Of Zeus with love, and now through Hera’s hate**  
**Is tried, perforce, with wanderings overlong?

 

ANTISTROPHE

 

*Io.*  How is it that thou speak’st my father’s name?**  
**Tell me, the suffering one,**  
**Who art thou, who, poor wretch,**  
**Who thus so truly nam’st me miserable,**  
**And tell’st the plague from Heaven,**  
**Which with its haunting stings**  
**Wears me to death? Ah woe,**  
**And I with famished and unseemly bounds**  
**Rush madly, driven by Hera’s jealous craft.**  
**Ah, who of all that suffer, born to woe,**  
**Have trouble like the pain that I endure?**  
**But thou, make clear to me**  
**What yet for me remains,**  
**What remedy, what healing for my pangs.**  
**Show me, if thou dost know:**  
**Speak out and tell to me,**  
**The maid by wanderings vexed.

 

*Prom.*  I will say plainly all thou seek’st to know;**  
**Not in dark tangled riddles, but plain speech,**  
**As it is meet that friends to friends should speak;**  
**Thou seest Prometheus who gave fire to men.

 

*Io.*  O thou to men as benefactor known,**  
**Why, poor Prometheus, sufferest thou this pain?

 

*Prom.*  I have but now mine own woes ceased to wail.

 

*Io.*  Wilt thou not then bestow this boon on me?

 

*Prom.*  Say what thou seek’st, for I will tell thee all.

 

*Io.*  Tell me, who fettered thee in this ravine?

 

*Prom.*  The counsel was of Zeus, the hand Hephæstos’.

 

*Io.*  Of what offence dost thou the forfeit pay?

 

*Prom.*  Thus much alone am I content to tell.

 

*Io.*  Tell me, at least, besides, what end shall come**  
**To my drear wanderings; when the time shall be.

 

*Prom.*  Not to know this is better than to know.

 

*Io.*  Nay, hide not from me what I have to bear.

 

*Prom.*  It is not that I grudge the boon to thee.

 

*Io.*  Why then delayest thou to tell the whole?

 

*Prom.*  Not from ill will, but loth to vex thy soul.

 

*Io.*  Nay, care thou not beyond what pleases me.

 

*Prom.*  If thou desire it I must speak. Hear then.

 

*Chor.*  Not yet though; grant me share of pleasure too.**  
**Let us first ask the tale of her great woe,**  
**While she unfolds her life’s consuming chances;**  
**Her future sufferings let her learn from thee.

 

*Prom.*  ’Tis thy work, Io, to grant these their wish,**  
**On other grounds and as thy father’s kin; **  
**For to bewail and moan one’s evil chance,**  
**Here where one trusts to gain a pitying tear**  
**From those who hear, — this is not labour lost.

 

*Io.*  I know not how to disobey your wish;**  
**So ye shall learn the whole that ye desire**  
**In speech full clear. And yet I blush to tell**  
**The storm that came from God, and brought the loss**  
**Of maiden face, what way it seized on me.**  
**For nightly visions coming evermore**  
**Into my virgin bower, sought to woo me**  
**With glozing words. “O virgin greatly blest,**  
**Why art thou still a virgin when thou might’st**  
**Attain to highest wedlock? For with dart**  
**Of passion for thee Zeus doth glow, and fain**  
**Would make thee His. And thou, O child, spurn not**  
**The bed of Zeus, but go to Lerna’s field,**  
**Where feed thy father’s flocks and herds,**  
**That so the eye of Zeus may find repose**  
**From this His craving.” With such visions I**  
**Was haunted every evening, till I dared**  
**To tell my father all these dreams of night,**  
**And he to Pytho and Dodona sent**  
**Full many to consult the Gods, that he**  
**Might learn what deeds and words would please Heaven’s lords.**  
**And they came bringing speech of oracles**  
**Shot with dark sayings, dim and hard to know.**  
**At last a clear word came to Inachos**  
**Charging him plainly, and commanding him**  
**To thrust me from my country and my home,**  
**To stray at large  to utmost bounds of earth;**  
**And, should he gainsay, that the fiery bolt**  
**Of Zeus should come and sweep away his race.**  
**And he, by Loxias’ oracles induced,**  
**Thrust me, against his will, against mine too,**  
**And drove me from my home; but spite of all,**  
**The curb of Zeus constrained him this to do.**  
**And then forthwith my face and mind were changed;**  
**And hornèd, as ye see me, stung to the quick**  
**By biting gadfly, I with maddened leap**  
**Rushed to Kerchneia’s fair and limpid stream,**  
**And fount of Lerna.  And a giant herdsman,**  
**Argos, full rough of temper, followed me,**  
**With many an eye beholding, on my track:**  
**And him a sudden and unlooked-for doom**  
**Deprived of life. And I, by gadfly stung,**  
**By scourge from Heaven am driven from land to land.**  
**What has been done thou hearest. And if thou**  
**Canst tell what yet remains of woe, declare it;**  
**Nor in thy pity soothe me with false words;**  
**For hollow words, I deem, are worst of ills.

 

*Chor.*  Away, away, let be:**  
**Ne’er thought I that such tales**  
**Would ever, ever come unto mine ears;**  
**Nor that such terrors, woes and outrages,**  
**Hard to look on, hard to bear,**  
**Would chill my soul with sharp goad, double-edged.**  
**Ah fate\! Ah fate\!**  
**I shudder, seeing Io’s fortune strange.

 

*Prom.*  Thou art too quick in groaning, full of fear:**  
**Wait thou awhile until thou hear the rest.

 

*Chor.*  Speak thou and tell. Unto the sick ’tis sweet**  
**Clearly to know what yet remains of pain.

 

*Prom.*  Your former wish ye gained full easily.**  
**Your first desire was to learn of her**  
**The tale she tells of her own sufferings;**  
**Now therefore hear the woes that yet remain**  
**For this poor maid to bear at Hera’s hands.**  
**And thou, O child of Inachos\! take heed**  
**To these my words, that thou mayst hear the goal**  
**Of all thy wanderings. First then, turning hence**  
**Towards the sunrise, tread the untilled plains,**  
**And thou shalt reach the Skythian nomads, those **  
**Who on smooth-rolling wagons dwell aloft**  
**In wicker houses, with far-darting bows**  
**Duly equipped. Approach thou not to these,**  
**But trending round the coasts on which the surf**  
**Beats with loud murmurs,  Traverse thou that clime.**  
**On the left hand there dwell the Chalybes, **  
**Who work in iron. Of these do thou beware,**  
**For fierce are they and most inhospitable;**  
**And thou wilt reach the river fierce and strong,**  
**True to its name.  This seek not thou to cross,**  
**For it is hard to ford, until thou come**  
**To Caucasos itself, of all high hills**  
**The highest, where a river pours its strength**  
**From the high peaks themselves. And thou must cross**  
**Those summits near the stars, must onward go**  
**Towards the south, where thou shalt find the host**  
**Of the Amâzons, hating men, whose home**  
**Shall one day be around Thermodon’s bank,**  
**By Themiskyra,  where the ravenous jaws**  
**Of Salmydessos ape upon the sea,**  
**Treacherous to sailors, stepdame stern to ships. **  
**And they right good-will shall be thy guides;**  
**And thou, hard by a broad pool’s narrow gates,**  
**Wilt pass to the Kimmerian isthmus. Leaving**  
**This boldly, thou must cross Mæotic channel; **  
**And there shall be great fame ‘mong mortal men**  
**Of this thy journey, and the Bosporos   
Shall take its name from thee. And Europe’s plain**  
**Then quitting, thou shalt gain the Asian coast.**  
**Doth not the all-ruling monarch of the Gods**  
**Seem all ways cruel? For, although a God,**  
**He, seeking to embrace this mortal maid,**  
**Imposed these wanderings on her. Thou hast found,**  
**O maiden\! bitter suitor for thy hand;**  
**For great as are the ills thou now hast heard,**  
**Know that as yet not e’en the prelude’s known.

 

*Io.*        Ah woe\! woe\! woe\!

 

*Prom.*  Again thou groan’st and criest. What wilt do**  
**When thou shalt learn the evils yet to come?

 

*Chor.*  What\! are there troubles still to come for her?

 

*Prom.*  Yea, stormy sea of woe most lamentable.

 

*Io.*  What gain is it to live? Why cast I not**  
**Myself at once from this high precipice,**  
**And, dashed to earth, be free from all my woes?**  
**Far better were it once for all to die**  
**Than all one’s day to suffer pain and grief.

 

*Prom.*  My struggles then full hardly thou wouldst bear,**  
**For whom there is no destiny of death;**  
**For that might bring a respite from my woes:**  
**But now there is no limit to my pangs**  
**Till Zeus be hurled out from His sovereignty.

 

*Io.*  What\! shall Zeus e’er be hurled from His high state?

 

*Prom.*  Thou wouldst rejoice, I trow, to see that fall.

 

*Io.*  How should I not, when Zeus so foully wrongs me?

 

*Prom.*  That this is so thou now mayst hear from me.

 

*Io.*  Who then shall rob Him of His sceptred sway?

 

*Prom.*  Himself shall do it by His own rash plans.

 

*Io.*  But how? Tell this, unless it bringeth harm.

 

*Prom.*  He shall wed one for whom one day He’ll grieve.

 

*Io.*  Heaven-born or mortal? Tell, if tell thou mayst.

 

*Prom.*  Why ask’st thou who? I may not tell thee that

 

*Io.*  Shall His bride hurl Him from His throne of might?

 

*Prom.*  Yea; she shall bear child mightier than his sire.

 

*Io.*  Has He no way to turn aside that doom?

 

*Prom.*  No, none; unless I from my bonds be loosed. 

 

*Io.*  Who then shall loose thee ‘gainst the will of Zeus?

 

*Prom.*  It must be one of thy posterity.

 

*Io.*  What, shall a child of mine free thee from ills?

 

*Prom.*  Yea, the third generation after ten. 

 

*Io.*  No more thine oracles are clear to me.

 

*Prom.*  Nay, seek not thou thine own drear fate to know.

 

*Io.*  Do not, a boon presenting, then withdraw it.

 

*Prom.*  Of two alternatives, I’ll give thee choice.

 

*Io.*  Tell me of what, then give me leave to choose.

 

*Prom.*  I give it then. Choose, or that I should tell**  
**Thy woes to come, or who shall set me free.

 

*Chor.*  Of these be willing one request to grant**  
**To her, and one to me; nor scorn my words:**  
**Tell her what yet of wandering she must bear,**  
**And me who shall release thee. This I crave.

 

*Prom.*  Since ye are eager, I will not refuse**  
**To utter fully all that ye desire.**  
**Thee, Io, first I’ll tell thy wanderings wild,**  
**Thou, write it in the tablets of thy mind.**  
**When thou shalt cross the straits, of continents**  
**The boundary,  take thou the onward path**  
**On to the fiery-hued and sun-tracked East.**  
**\[And first of all, to frozen Northern blasts**  
**Thou’lt come, and there beware the rushing whirl,**  
**Lest it should come upon thee suddenly,**  
**And sweep thee onward with the cloud-rack wild;\] **  
**Crossing the sea-surf till thou come at last**  
**Unto Kisthene’s Gorgoneian plains,**  
**Where dwell the grey-haired virgin Phorkides, **  
**Three, swan-shaped, with one eye between them all**  
**And but one tooth; whom nor the sun beholds**  
**With radiant beams, nor yet the moon by night:**  
**And near them are their wingèd sisters three,**  
**The Gorgons, serpent-tressed, and hating men,**  
**Whom mortal wight may not behold and live.**  
**Such is one ill I bid thee guard against;**  
**Now hear another monstrous sight: Beware**  
**The sharp-beaked hounds of Zeus that never bark, **  
**The Gryphons, and the one-eyed mounted host**  
**Of Arimaspians, who around the stream**  
**That flows o’er gold, the ford of Pluto, dwell: **  
**Draw not thou night to them. But distant land**  
**Thou shalt approach, the swarthy tribes who dwell**  
**By the sun’s fountain,  Æthiopia’s stream:**  
**By its banks wend thy way until thou come To**  
**that great fall where from the Bybline hills**  
**The Neilos pours its pure and holy flood;**  
**And it shall guide thee to Neilotic land,**  
**Three-angled, where, O Io, ’tis decreed**  
**For thee and for thy progeny to found**  
**A far-off colony. And if of this**  
**Aught seem to thee as stammering speech obscure,**  
**Ask yet again and learn it thoroughly:**  
**Far more of leisure have I than I like.

 

*Chor.*  If thou hast aught to add, aught left untold**  
**Of her sore-wasting wanderings, speak it out;**  
**But if thou hast said all, then grant to us**  
**The boon we asked. Thou dost not, sure, forget it.

 

*Prom.*  The whole course of her journeying she hath heard,**  
**And that she show she hath not heard in vain**  
**I will tell out what troubles she hath borne**  
**Before she came here, giving her sure proof**  
**Of these my words. The greater bulk of things**  
**I will pass o’er, and to the very goal**  
**Of all thy wanderings go. For when thou cam’st**  
**To the Molossian plains, and by the grove **  
**Of lofty-ridged Dodona, and the shrine**  
**Oracular of Zeus Thesprotian,**  
**And the strange portent of the talking oaks,**  
**By which full clearly, not in riddle dark,**  
**Thou wast addressed as noble spouse of Zeus, — **  
**If aught of pleasure such things give to thee, — **  
**Thence strung to frenzy, thou didst rush along**  
**The sea-coast’s path to Rhea’s mighty gulf, **  
**In backward way from whence thou now art vexed,**  
**And for all time to come that reach of sea,**  
**Know well, from thee Ionian shall be called,**  
**To all men record of thy journeyings.**  
**These then are tokens to thee that my mind**  
**Sees somewhat more than that is manifest.**  
**What follows \(*to the Chorus*\) I will speak to you and her**  
**In common, on the track of former words**  
**Returning once again. A city stands,**  
**Canobos, at its country’s furthest bound,**  
**Hard by the mouth and silt-bank of the Nile;**  
**There Zeus shall give thee back thy mind again, **  
**With hand that works no terror touching thee, — **  
**Touch only — and thou then shalt bear a child**  
**Of Zeus begotten, Epaphos, “Touch-born,”**  
**Swarthy of hue, whose lot shall be to reap**  
**The whole plain watered by the broad-streamed Neilos:**  
**And in the generation fifth from him**  
**A household numbering fifty shall return**  
**Against their will to Argos, in their flight**  
**From wedlock with their cousins.  And they too**  
**\(Kites but a little space behind the doves\),**  
**With eager hopes pursuing marriage rites,**  
**Beyond pursuit shall come; and God shall grudge**  
**To give up their sweet bodies. And the land**  
**Pelasgian  shall receive them, when by stroke**  
**Of woman’s murderous hand these men shall lie**  
**Smitten to death by daring deed of night:**  
**For every bride shall take her husband’s life,**  
**And dip in blood the sharp two-edgèd sword**  
**\(So to my foes may Kypris show herself\!\) **  
**Yet one of that fair band shall love persuade**  
**Her husband not to slaughter, and her will**  
**Shall lose its edge; and she shall make her choice**  
**Rather as weak than murderous to be known.**  
**And she at Argos shall a royal seed**  
**Bring forth \(long speech ’twould take to tell this clear\)**  
**Famed for his arrows, who shall set me free **  
**From these my woes. Such was the oracle**  
**Mine ancient mother Themis, Titan-born,**  
**Gave to me; but the manner and the means, — **  
**That needs a lengthy tale to tell the whole,**  
**And thou canst nothing gain by learning it.

 

*Io.*  Eleleu\! Oh, Eleleu\! **  
**The throbbing pain inflames me, and the mood**  
**Of frenzy-smitten rage;**  
**The gadfly’s pointed stings,**  
**Not forged with fire, attacks,**  
**And my heart beats against my breast with fear.**  
**Mine eyes whirl round and round:**  
**Out of my course I’m borne**  
**By the wild spirit of fierce agony,**  
**And cannot curb my lips,**  
**And turbid speech at random dashes on**  
**Upon the waves of dread calamity.

 

STROPHE I

 

*Chor.*  Wise, very wise was he**  
**Who first in thought conceived this maxim sage,**  
**And spread it with his speech, — **  
**That the best wedlock is with equals found,**  
**And that a craftsman, born to work with hands,**  
**Should not desire to wed**  
**Or with the soft luxurious heirs of wealth,**  
**Or with the race that boast their lineage high.

 

ANTISTROPHE I**  
**      Oh ne’er, oh ne’er, dread Fates,**  
**May ye behold me as the bride of Zeus,**  
**The partner of His couch,**  
**Nor may I wed with any heaven — born spouse\!**  
**For I shrink back, beholding Io’s lot**  
**Of loveless maindenhood,**  
**Consumed and smitten low exceedingly**  
**By the wild wanderings from great Hera sent\!

 

STROPHE II**  
**To me, when wedlock is on equal terms,**  
**It gives no cause to fear:**  
**Ne’er may the love of any of the Gods,**  
**The strong Gods, look on me**  
**With glance I cannot ‘scape\!

 

ANTISTROPHE II**  
**That fate is was that none can war against,**  
**Source of resourceless ill;**  
**Nor know I what might then become of me:**  
**I see not how to ‘scape**  
**The counsel deep of Zeus.

 

*Prom.*  Yea, of a truth shall Zeus, though stiff of will,**  
**Be brought full low. Such bed of wedlock now**  
**Is He preparing, one to cast Him forth**  
**In darkness from His sovereignty and throne.**  
**And then the curse His father Cronos spake**  
**Shall have its dread completion, even that**  
**He uttered when he left his ancient throne;**  
**And from these troubles no one of the Gods**  
**But me can clearly show the way to ‘scape.**  
**I know the time and manner: therefore now**  
**Let Him sit fearless, in His peals on high**  
**Putting His trust, and shaking in His hands**  
**His darts fire-breathing. Nought shall they avail**  
**To hinder Him from falling shamefully**  
**A fall intolerable. Such a combatant**  
**He arms against Himself, a marvel dread,**  
**Who shall a fire discover mightier far**  
**Than the red levin, and a sound more dread**  
**Than roaring of the thunder, and shall shiver**  
**That plague sea-born that causeth earth to quake,**  
**The trident, weapon of Poseidon’s strength:**  
**And stumbling on this evil, He shall learn**  
**How far apart a king’s lot from a slave’s.

 

*Chor.*  What thou dost with thou mutterest against Zeus.

 

*Prom.*  Things that shall be, and things I wish, I speak.

 

*Chor.*  And must we look for one to master Zeus?

 

*Prom.*  Yea, troubles harder far than these are His.

 

*Chor.*  Art not afraid to vent such words as these?

 

*Prom.*  What can I fear whose fate is not to die?

 

*Chor.*  But He may send on thee worse pain than this.

 

*Prom.*  So let Him do: nought finds me prepared.

 

*Chor.*  Wisdom is theirs who Adrasteia worship. 

 

*Prom.*  Worship then, praise and flatter Him that rules;**  
**My care for Zeus is nought, and less than nought:**  
**Let Him act, let Him rule this little while,**  
**E’en as He will; for long He shall not rule**  
**Over the Gods. But lo\! I seed at hand**  
**The courier of the Gods, the minister**  
**Of our new sovereign. Doubtless he has come**  
**To bring me tidings of some new device.**  
***Enter* HERMES

 

*Herm.*  Thee do I speak to, — thee, the teacher wise,**  
**The bitterly o’er-bitter, who ‘gainst Gods**  
**Hast sinned in giving gifts to short-lived men — **  
**I speak to thee, the filcher of bright fire.**  
**The Father bids thee say what marriage thou**  
**Dost vaunt, and who shall hurl Him from His might;**  
**And this too not in dark mysterious speech,**  
**But tell each point out clearly. Give me not,**  
**Prometheus, task of double journey. Zeus,**  
**Thou seest, is not with such words appeased.

 

*Prom.*  Stately of utterance, full of haughtiness**  
**Thy speech, as fits a messenger of Gods.**  
**Ye yet are young in your new rule, and think**  
**To dwell in painless towers. Have I not**  
**Seen two great rulers driven forth from thence? **  
**And now the third, who reigneth, I shall see**  
**In basest, quickest fall. Seem I to thee**  
**To shrink and quail before these new-made Gods?**  
**Far, very far from that am I. But thou,**  
**Track once again the path by which thou camest;**  
**Thou shalt learn nought of what thou askest me.

 

*Herm.*  It was by such self-will as this before**  
**That thou didst bring these sufferings on thyself.

 

*Prom.*  I for my part, be sure, would never change**  
**My evil state for that thy bondslave’s lot.

 

*Herm.*  To be the bondslave of this rock, I trow,**  
**Is better than to be Zeus’ trusty herald\!

 

*Prom.*  So it is meet the insulter to insult.

 

*Herm.*  Thou waxest proud, ’twould seem, of this thy doom.

 

*Prom.*  Wax proud\! God grant that I may see my foes**  
**Thus waxing proud, and thee among the rest\!

 

*Herm.*  Dost blame me then for thy calamities?

 

*Prom.*  In one short sentence — all the Gods I hate,**  
**Who my good turns with evil turns repay.

 

*Herm.*  Thy words prove thee with no slight madness plagued.

 

*Prom.*  If to hate foes be madness, mad I am.

 

*Herm.*  Not one could bear thee wert thou prosperous.

 

*Prom.*  Ah me\!

 

*Herm.*  That word is all unknown to Zeus.

 

*Prom.*  Time waxing old can many a lesson teach.

 

*Herm.*  Yet thou at least hast not true wisdom learnt.

 

*Prom.*  I had not else addressed a slave like thee.

 

*Herm.*  Thou wilt say nought the Father asks, ’twould seem.

 

*Prom.*  Fine debt I owe Him, favour to repay.

 

*Herm.*  Me as a boy thou scornest then, forsooth.

 

*Prom.*  And art thou not a boy, and sillier far,**  
**If that thou thinkest to learn aught from me?**  
**There is no torture nor device by which**  
**Zeus can impel me to disclose these things**  
**Before these bonds that outrage me be loosed.**  
**Let then the blazing levin-flash be hurled;**  
**With white-winged snow-storm and with earth-born thunders**  
**Let Him disturb and trouble all that is;**  
**Nought of these things shall force me to declare**  
**Whose hand shall drive Him from His sovereignty.

 

*Herm.*  See if thou findest any help in this.

 

*Prom.*  Long since all this I’ve seen, and formed my plans.

 

*Herm.*  O fool, take heart, take heart at last in time,**  
**To form right thoughts for these thy present woes.

 

*Prom.*  Like one who soothes a wave, thy speech in vain**  
**Vexes my soul. But deem not thou that I,**  
**Fearing the will of Zeus, shall e’er become**  
**As womanised in mind, or shall entreat**  
**Him whom I greatly loathe, with upturned hand,**  
**In woman’s fashion, from these bonds of mine**  
**To set me free. Far, far am I from that.

 

*Herm.*  It seems that I, saying much, shall speak in vain;**  
**For thou in nought by prayers art pacified,**  
**Or softened in thy heart, but like a colt**  
**Fresh harnessed, thou dost champ thy bit, and strive,**  
**And fight against the reins. Yet thou art stiff**  
**In weak device; for self-will, by itself,**  
**In one who is not wise, is less than nought.**  
**Look to it, if thou disobey my words,**  
**How great a storm and triple wave of ills, **  
**Not to be ‘scaped, shall come on thee; for first,**  
**With thunder and the levin’s blazing flash**  
**The Father this ravine of rocks shall crush,**  
**And shall thy carcase hide, and stern embrace**  
**Of stony arms shall keep thee in thy place.**  
**And having traversed space of time full long,**  
**Thou shalt come back to light, and then his hound,**  
**The wingèd hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle,**  
**Shall greedily make banquet of thy flesh,**  
**Coming all day an uninvited guest,**  
**And glut himself upon thy liver dark.**  
**And of that anguish look not for the end,**  
**Before some God shall come to bear thy woes,**  
**And will to pass to Hades’ sunless realm,**  
**And the dark cloudy depths of Tartaros. **  
**Wherefore take heed. No feigned boast is this,**  
**But spoken all too truly; for the lips**  
**Of Zeus know not to speak in lying speech,**  
**But will perform each single word. And thou,**  
**Search well, be wise, nor think that self-willed pride**  
**Shall ever better prove than counsel good.

 

*Chor.*  To us doth Hermes seem to utter words**  
**Not out of season; for he bids thee quit**  
**Thy self-willed pride and seek for counsel good.**  
**Hearken thou to him. To the wise of soul**  
**It is foul shame to sin persistently.

 

*Prom.*  To me who knew it all**  
**He hath this message borne;**  
**And that a foe from foes**  
**Should suffer is not strange.**  
**Therefore on me be hurled**  
**The sharp-edged wreath of fire;**  
**And let heaven’s vault be stirred**  
**With thunder and the blasts**  
**Of fiercest winds; and earth**  
**From its foundations strong,**  
**E’en to its deepest roots,**  
**Let storm-wind make to rock;**  
**And let the ocean wave,**  
**With wild and foaming surge,**  
**Be heaped up to the paths**  
**Where move the stars of heaven;**  
**And to dark Tartaros**  
**Let Him my carcase hurl,**  
**With mighty blasts of force:**  
**Yet me He shall not slay.

 

*Herm.*  Such words and thoughts from one**  
**Brain-stricken one may hear.**  
**What space divides his state**  
**From frenzy? What repose**  
**Hath he from maddened rage?**  
**But ye who pitying stand**  
**And share his bitter griefs,**  
**Quickly from hence depart,**  
**Lest the relentless roar**  
**Of thunder stun your soul.

 

*Chor.*  With other words attempt**  
**To counsel and persuade,**  
**And I will hear: for now**  
**Thou hast this word thrust in**  
**That we may never bear.**  
**How dost thou bid me train**  
**My soul to baseness vile?**  
**With him I will endure**  
**Whatever is decreed.**  
**Traitors I’ve learned to hate,**  
**Nor is there any plague**  
**That more than this I loathe.

 

*Herm.*  Nay then, remember ye**  
**What now I say, nor blame**  
**Your fortune: never say**  
**That Zeus hath cast you down**  
**To evil not foreseen.**  
**Not so; ye cast yourselves:**  
**For now with open eyes,**  
**Not taken unawares,**  
**In Atè’s endless net**  
**Ye shall entangled be**  
**By folly of your own.  \[*A pause, and then flashes of lightning and peals of thunder* 

 

*Prom.*  Yea, now in very deed,**  
**No more in word alone,**  
**The earth shakes to and fro,**  
**And the loud thunder’s voice**  
**Bellows hard by, and blaze**  
**The flashing levin-fires;**  
**And tempests whirl the dust,**  
**And gusts of all wild winds**  
**On one another leap,**  
**In wild conflicting blasts,**  
**And sky with sea is blent:**  
**Such is the storm from Zeus**  
**That comes as working fear,**  
**In terrors manifest.

 

O Mother venerable\!

 

O Æther\! rolling round**  
**The common light of all,**  
**Seest thou what wrongs I bear?

## **INTRODUCTORY NOTE**

![img124.jpg](images/001225.jpg)

 

SOPHOCLES, THE MOST perfectly balanced among the three great masters of Greek tragedy, was born in Colonus, near Athens, about 495 B. C. His father was a man of wealth, and the poet received the best education of the time, being especially distinguished in music. He began his career as a PARAtist at the age of twenty-seven, when he gained a victory over Æschylus; and from that time till his death in 405 B. C. he retained the foremost place as a writer of tragedy. Like a true Greek, he played his part in public affairs, both in peace and in war, and served his country as a diplomat and as a general. He was profoundly admired by his contemporaries for character as well as genius, and after his death was honored as a hero with annual sacrifices. His son, Iophon, and his grandson, Sophocles, both gained distinction as tragic poets.

Besides lyrics, elegies, and epigrams, Sophocles is said to have composed upward of one hundred and twenty plays, one hundred of which are known by name, but only seven have come down to us entire. These are the “Trachiniæ,” dealing with the death of Heracles; “Ajax,” “Philoctetes,” “Electra,” “Œdipus Rex,” “Œdipus at Colonus,” and Antigone.”

The development of tragedy by Æschylus was continued by Sophocles, who introduced a third actor and, later, a fourth; reduced still further the importance of the chorus, and elaborated the costumes of the players. He did not, like Æschylus, write trilogies which carried one story through three plays, but made each work complete in itself. The art of clear and full characterization was carried to a pitch of perfection by him, the figures in the plays of Æschylus being in comparison rather drawings in outline, while those of Euripides are frequently direct transcripts from real life, without the idealization given by Sophocles. With his restraint, his balance, his clearness of vision, his aptness in the fitting of means to ends, and the beauty of his style, he stands as the most perfect example in literature of the characteristic excellences of the Greek artist. In the two PARAs here given will be found illustrations of these qualities at their highest.

*E**nter* ŒDIPUS

 

ŒDIPUS;  WHY sit ye here, my children, brood last reared  
Of Cadmus famed of old, in solemn state,  
Uplifting in your hands the suppliants’ boughs?  
And all the city reeks with incense smoke,  
And all re-echoes with your wailing hymns;  
And I, my children, counting it unmeet  
To hear report from others, I have come  
Myself, whom all name Œdipus the Great. —   
Do thou, then, agèd Sire, since thine the right  
To speak for these, tell clearly why ye stand  
Awe-stricken, or adoring; speak to me  
As willing helper. Dull and cold this heart  
To see you prostrate thus, and feel no ruth.

 

PRIEST  Yes, Œdipus, thou ruler of my land,  
Thou seest us how we sit, as suppliants, bowed  
Around thine altars; some as yet unfledged  
To wing their flight, and some weighed down with age.  
Priest, I, of Zeus, and these the chosen youth:  
And in the open spaces of the town  
The people sit and wail, with wreath in hand,  
By the twin shrine of Pallas, or the grove  
Oracular that bears Ismenus’ name.  
For this our city, as thine eyes may see,  
Is sorely tempest-tossed, nor lifts its head  
From out the surging sea of blood-flecked waves,  
All smitten in the fruitful blooms of earth,  
All smitten in the herds that graze the fields,  
Yea, and in timeless births of woman’s fruit;  
And still the God sends forth his darts of fire,  
And lays us low. The plague, abhorred and feared,  
Makes desolate the home where Cadmus dwelt,  
And Hades dark grows rich in sighs and groans.  
It is not that we count thee as a God,  
Equalled with them in power, that we sit here,  
These little ones and I, as suppliants prone;  
But, judging thee, in all life’s shifting scenes,  
Chiefest of men, yea, and of chiefest skill,  
To soothe the powers of Heaven. For thou it was  
That freed’st this city, named of Cadmus old,  
From the sad tribute which of yore we paid  
To that stern songstress, all untaught of us,  
And all unprompted; but at God’s behest,  
Men think and say, thou guidest all our life.  
And now, O Œdipus, most honoured lord,  
We pray thee, we, thy suppliants, find for us  
Some succour, whether floating voice of God,  
Or speech of man brings knowledge to thy soul;  
For still I see, with those whom life has trained  
To long-tried skill, the issues of their thoughts  
Live and are mighty. Come, then, noblest one,  
Come, save our city; look on us, and fear.  
As yet this land, for all thy former zeal,  
Calls thee its saviour: do not give us cause  
So to remember this thy reign, as men  
Who, having risen, then fall low again;  
But save us, save our city. Omens good  
Were then with thee; thou didst thy work, and now  
Be equal to thyself\! If thou wilt rule,  
As thou dost rule, this land wherein we dwell,  
‘Twere better far to reign o’er living men  
Than o’er a realm dispeopled. Naught avails,  
Or tower or ship, when crew and guards are gone.

 

ŒDIP.  O children, wailing loud, ye tell me not  
Of woes unknown; too well I know them all,  
Your sorrows and your wants. For one and all  
Are stricken, yet no sorrow like to mine  
Weighs on you. Each his own sad burden bears,  
His own and not another’s. But my heart  
Mourns for the people’s sorrow and mine own;  
And, lo\! ye have not come to break my sleep,  
But found me weeping, weeping bitter tears,  
And treading weary paths in wandering thought;  
And that one way of healing which I found,  
That have I acted on. Menœkeus’ son,  
Creon, my kinsman, have I sent to seek  
The Pythian home of Phœbus, there to learn  
The words or deeds wherewith to save the state;  
And even now I measure o’er the time  
And wonder how he fares, for, lo\! he stays,  
I know not why, beyond the appointed day;  
But when he comes I should be base indeed,  
Failing to do whate’er the God declares.

 

PRIEST  Well hast thou spoken\! Tidings come e’en now  
Of Creon seen approaching.

 

ŒDIP.  Grant, O King  
Apollo, that he come with omen good,  
Bright with the cheer of one that bringeth life.

 

PRIEST  If one may guess, ’tis well. He had not come  
His head all wreathed with boughs of laurel else.

 

ŒDIP.  Soon we shall know. Our voice can reach him now.  
Say, prince, our well-beloved, Menœkeus’ son,  
What sacred answer bring’st thou from the God?  
*Enter* CREON

 

CREON.  A right good answer\! That our evil plight,  
If all goes well, may end in highest good.

 

ŒDIP.  What means this speech? Nor full of eager hope,  
Nor trembling panic, list I to thy words.

 

CREON.  I for my part am ready, these being by,  
to tell thee all, or go within the gates.

 

ŒDIP.  Speak out to all. I sorrow more for them  
Than for the woe which touches me alone.

 

CREON.  Well, then, I speak the things the God declared.  
Phœbus, our king, he bids us chase away  
\(The words were plain\) the infection of our land,  
Nor cherish guilt which still remains unhealed.

 

ŒDIP.  But with what rites? And what the deed itself?

 

CREON.  Drive into exile, blood for blood repay.  
That guilt of blood is blasting all the state.

 

ŒDIP.  But whose fate is it that thou hintest at?

 

CREON.  Once, O my king, ere thou didst raise our state,  
Our sovereign Laius ruled o’er all the land.

 

ŒDIP.  This know I well, though him I never saw.

 

CREON.  Well, then, the God commands us, he being dead,  
To take revenge on those who shed his blood.

 

ŒDIP.  Yes; but where are they? How to track the course  
Of guilt all shrouded in the doubtful past?

 

CREON.  In this our land, so said he, those who seek  
Shall find; unsought, we lose it utterly.

 

ŒDIP.  Was it at home, or in the field, or else  
In some strange land that Laius met his doom?

 

CREON.  He went, so spake he, pilgrim-wise afar,  
And nevermore came back as forth he went.

 

ŒDIP.  Was there no courier, none who shared his road,  
From whom, inquiring, one might learn the truth?

 

CREON.  Dead are they all, save one who fled for fear,  
And he had naught to tell but this:…

 

ŒDIP.  \[*interrupting*\] And what was that? One fact might teach us much,  
Had we but one small starting-point of hope.

 

CREON.  He used to tell that robbers fell on him,  
Not man for man, but with outnumbering force.

 

ŒDIP.  Yet sure no robber would have dared this deed,  
Unless some bribe had tempted him from hence.

 

CREON.  So men might think; but Laius at his death  
Found none to help, or ‘venge him in his woe.

 

ŒDIP.  What hindered you, when thus your sovereignty  
Had fallen low, from searching out the truth?

 

CREON.  The Sphinx, with her dark riddle, bade us look  
At nearer facts, and leave the dim obscure.

 

ŒDIP.  Well, be it mine to track them to their source.  
Right well hath Phœbus, and right well hast thou,  
Shown for the dead your care, and ye shall find,  
As is most meet, in me a helper true,  
Aiding at once my country and the God.  
Not for the sake of friends, or near or far,  
But for mine own, will I dispel this curse;  
For he that slew him, whosoe’er he be,  
Will wish, perchance, with such a blow to smite  
Me also. Helping him, I help myself.  
And now, my children, rise with utmost speed  
From off these steps, and raise your suppliant boughs;  
And let another call my people here,  
The race of Cadmus, and make known that I  
Will do my taskwork to the uttermost:  
So, as God wills, we prosper, or we fail.

 

PRIEST  Rise, then, my children, ’twas for this we came,  
For these good tidings which those lips have brought,  
And Phœbus, he who sent these oracles,  
Pray that he come to heal, and save from woe.  \[*Exeunt* CREON *and Priest.*

 

STROPH. I

 

CHORUS  O voice of Zeus sweet-toned, with what intent  
Cam’st thou from Pytho, where the red gold shines,  
To Thebes, of high estate?  
Fainting for fear, I quiver in suspense  
\(Hear us, O healer\! God of Delos, hear\!\),  
In brooding dread, what doom, of present growth,  
Or as the months roll on, thy hand will work;  
Tell me, O Voice divine, thou child of golden hope\!

 

ANTISTROPH. I

 

Thee first, Zeus-born Athene, thee I call;  
And next thy sister, Goddess of our land,  
Our Artemis, who in the market sits  
In queenly pride, upon her orbed throne;  
And Phœbus, the fair darter\! O ye Three,  
Shine on us, and deliver us from ill\!  
If e’er before, when waves or storms of woe  
Rushed on our state, ye drove away  
The fiery tide of ill,  
Come also now\!

 

STROPH. II

 

Yea, come, ye Gods, for sorrows numberless  
Press on my soul;  
And all the host is smitten, and our thoughts  
Lack weapons to resist.  
For increase fails of all the fruits of earth,  
And women faint in childbirth’s wailing pangs,  
And one by one, as flit the swift-winged birds,  
So, flitting to the shore of Hades dark,  
Fleeter than lightning’s flash,  
Thou seest them passing on.

 

ANTISTROPH. II

 

Yea, numberless are they who perish thus,  
And on the soil, plague-breeding, lie  
Infants unpitied, cast out ruthlessly;  
And wives and mothers, gray with hoary age,  
Some here, some there, by every altar mourn,  
With woe and sorrow crushed,  
And chant their wailing plaint.  
Clear thrills the sense their solemn litany,  
And the low anthem sung in unison.  
Hear, then, thou golden daughter of great Zeus,  
And send us help, bright-faced as is the morn.

 

STROPH. III

 

And Ares the destroyer drive away\!  
Who now, though hushed the din of brazen shield,  
With battle-cry wars on me fierce and hot.  
Bid him go back in flight,  
Retreat from this our land,  
Or to the ocean bed,  
Where Amphitrite sleeps,  
Or to the homeless sea  
Which sweeps the Thracian shore.  
If waning night spares aught  
That doth the day assail:  
Do thou, then, Sire almighty,  
Wielding the lightning’s strength,  
Blast him with thy hot thunder.

 

ANTISTROPH. III

 

And thou, Lyceian king, the wolf’s dread foe,  
Fain would I see thy darts  
From out thy golden bow  
Go forth invincible,  
Helping and bringing aid;  
And with them, winged with fire,  
The rays of Artemis,  
With which, on Lycian hills,  
She moveth on her course.  
And last I call on thee,  
Thou of the golden crown,  
Guardian of this our land,  
Bacchus, all purple-flushed,  
With clamour loud and long,  
Wandering with Maenads wild;  
I call on thee to come,  
Flashing with blazing torch,  
Against the God whom all the Gods disown.

 

ŒDIP.  Thou prayest, and for thy prayers, if thou wilt hear  
My words, and treat the dire disease with skill,  
Thou shalt find help and respite from thy pain, —   
My words, which I, a stranger to report,  
A stranger to the deed, will now declare:  
For I myself should fail to track it far,  
Unless some footprints guided me aright.  
But now, since here I stand, the latest come,  
A citizen to citizens, I speak  
To all the sons of Cadmus. Lives there one  
Who knows of Laitus, son of Labdacus,  
The hand that slew him; him I bid to tell  
His tale to me; and should it chance he shrinks,  
Fearing the charge against himself to bring,  
Still let him speak; no heavier doom is his  
Than to depart uninjured from the land;  
Or, if there be that knows an alien arm  
As guilty, let him hold his peace no more;  
I will secure his gain and thanks beside.  
But if ye hold your peace, if one through fear  
Shall stifle words his bosom friend may drop,  
What then I purpose let him hear from me:  
That man I banish, whosoe’er he be,  
From out the land whose power and throne are mine;  
And none may give him shelter, none speak to him,  
Nor join with him in prayer and sacrifice,  
Nor pour for him the stream that cleanses guilt;  
But all shall thrust him from their homes, abhorred,  
Our curse and our pollution, as the word  
Prophetic of the Pythian God has shown:  
Such as I am, I stand before you here,  
A helper to the God and to the dead.  
And for the man who did the guilty deed,  
Whether alone he lurks, or leagued with more,  
I pray that he may waste his life away,  
For vile deeds vilely dying; and for me,  
If in my house, I knowing it, he dwells,  
May every curse I speak on my head fall.  
And this I charge you do, for mine own sake,  
And for the God’s, and for the land that pines,  
Barren and god-deserted. Wrong ’twould be,  
E’en if no voice from heaven had urged us on,  
That ye should leave the stain of guilt uncleansed,  
Your noblest chief, your king himself, being slain.  
Yea, rather, seek and find. And since I reign,  
Wielding the might his hand did wield before,  
Filling his couch, and calling his wife mine,  
Yea, and our children too, but for the fate  
That fell on his, had grown up owned by both;  
But so it is. On his head fell the doom;  
And therefore will I strive my best for him,  
As for my father, and will go all lengths  
To seek and find the murderer, him who slew  
The son of Labdacus, and Polydore,  
And earlier Cadmus, and Agenor old;  
And for all those who hearken not, I pray  
The Gods to give then neither fruit of earth,  
Nor seed of woman, but consume their lives  
With this dire plague, or evil worse than this.  
And you, the rest, the men from Cadmus sprung,  
To whom these words approve themselves as good,  
May righteousness befriend you, and the Gods,  
In full accord, dwell with you evermore.

 

CHORUS  Since thou hast bound me by a curse, O king,  
I needs must speak. I neither slew the man,  
Nor know who slew. To say who did the deed  
Belongs to him who sent this oracle.

 

ŒDIP.  Right well thou speak’st, but man’s best strength must fail  
To force the Gods to do the things they will not.

 

CHORUS  And may I speak a second time my thoughts?

 

ŒDIP.  If ‘twere a third, shrink not from speaking out.

 

CHORUS  One man I know, a prince, whose insight deep  
Sees clear as princely Phœbus, and from him,  
Teiresias, one might learn, O king, the truth.

 

ŒDIP.  That, too, is done. No loiterer I in this,  
For I have sent, on Creon’s hint, two bands  
To summon him, and wonder that he comes not.

 

CHORUS  Old rumours are there also, dark and dumb.

 

ŒDIP.  And what are they? I weigh the slightest word.

 

CHORUS  ’Twas said he died by some chance traveller’s hand.

 

ŒDIP.  I, too, heard that. But none knows who was by.

 

CHORUS  If yet his soul is capable of awe,  
Hearing thy curses, he will shrink from them.

 

ŒDIP.  Words fright not him who, doing, knows no fear.

 

CHORUS  Well, here is one who’ll put him to the proof.  
For, lo\! they bring the seer inspired of God;  
Chosen of all men, vessel of the truth.  
*Enter* TEIRESIAS, *blind, and guided by a boy*

 

ŒDIP.  Teiresias\! thou whose mind embraceth all,  
Told or untold, the things of heaven or earth;  
Thou knowest, although thou seest not, what a pest  
Dwells on us, and we find in thee, O prince,  
Our one deliverer, yea, our only help.  
For Phœbus \(if, perchance, thou hast not heard\)  
Sent back this word to us, who sent to ask,  
That this one way was open to escape  
From the fell plague; if those who Laius slew,  
We in our turn, discovering, should slay,  
Or drive them forth as exiles from the land.  
Thou, therefore, grudge not either sign from birds,  
Or any other path of prophecy;  
But save the city, save thyself, save me;  
Lift off the guilt that death has left behind;  
On thee we hang. To use our means, our power,  
In doing good, is noblest service owned.

 

TEIR.  Ah me\! ah me\! how sad is wisdom’s gift,  
When no good issue waiteth on the wise\!  
Right well I knew this, but in evil hour  
Forgot, alas\! or else I had not come.

 

ŒDIP.  What means this? How despondingly thou com’st\!

 

TEIR.  Let me go home; for thus thy fate shalt thou,  
And I mine own, bear easiest, if thou yield.

 

ŒDIP.  No loyal words thou speak’st, nor true to Thebes  
Who reared thee, holding back this oracle.

 

TEIR.  It is because I see thy lips speak words  
Ill-timed, ill-omened, that I guard my speech.

 

ŒDIP.  Now, by the Gods, unless thy reason fails,  
Refuse us not, who all implore thy help.

 

TEIR.  Yes. Reason fails you all; but ne’er will I  
So speak my sorrows as to unveil thine.

 

ŒDIP.  What mean’st thou, then? Thou know’st and wilt not tell,  
But giv’st to ruin both the state and us?

 

TEIR.  I will not pain myself nor thee. Why, then,  
All vainly urge it? Thou shalt never know.

 

ŒDIP.  Oh, basest of the base\! \(for thou wouldst stir  
A heart of stone;\) and wilt thou never tell,  
But still abide relentless and unmoved?

 

TEIR.  My mood thou blamest, but thou dost not know  
That which dwells with thee while thou chidest me.

 

ŒDIP.  And who would not feel anger, as he hears  
The words which bring dishonour to the state?

 

TEIR.  Well\! come they will, though I should hold my peace.

 

ŒDIP.  If come they must, thy duty is to speak.

 

TEIR.  I speak no more. So, if thou wilt, rage on,  
With every mood of wrath most desperate.

 

ŒDIP.  Yes; I will not refrain, so fierce my wrath,  
From speaking all my thought. I think that thou  
Didst plot the deed, and do it, though the blow  
Thy hands, it may be, dealt not. Hadst thou seen,  
I would have said it was thy deed alone

 

TEIR.  And it has come to this? I charge thee, hold  
To thy late edict, and from this day forth  
Speak not to me, nor yet to these, for thou,  
Thou art the accursèd plague-spot of the land.

 

ŒDIP.  Art thou so shameless as to vent such words,  
And thinkest to escape thy righteous doom?

 

TEIR.  I have escaped. The strength of truth is mine.

 

ŒDIP.  Who prompted thee? This comes not from thine art.

 

TEIR.  Thou art the man. ’Twas thou who mad’st me speak.

 

ŒDIP.  What say’st thou? Tell it yet again, that I  
May know more clearly.

 

TEIR.  When I spoke before,  
Didst thou not know? Or dost thou challenge me?

 

ŒDIP.  I could not say I knew it. Speak again.

 

TEIR.  I say that thou stand’st there a murderer.

 

ŒDIP.  Thou shalt not twice revile, and go unharmed.

 

TEIR.  And shall I tell thee more to stir thy rage?

 

ŒDIP.  Say what thou pleasest. All in vain ’tis said.

 

TEIR.  I say that thou, in vilest intercourse  
With those thou lovest best, dost blindly live,  
Nor seest the evil thou hast made thine own.

 

ŒDIP.  And dost thou think to say these things and live?

 

TEIR.  Of that I doubt not, if truth holds her own.

 

ŒDIP.  Truth is for all but thee, but thou hast none,  
Blind in thine ears, thy reason, and thine eyes.

 

TEIR.  How wretched thou, thus hurling this reproach\!  
Such, all too soon, the world will hurl at thee.

 

ŒDIP.  Thou livest wrapt in one continual night,  
And canst not hurt or me, or any man  
Who sees the light.

 

TEIR.  Fate’s firm decree stands fixed:  
Thou diest not by me. Apollo’s might  
Suffices. His the task to bring thee low.

 

ŒDIP.  Are these devices Creon’s or thine own?

 

TEIR.  It is not Creon harms thee, but thyself.

 

ŒDIP.  O wealth, and sovereignty, and noblest skill  
Surpassing skill in life that men admire,  
How great the envy dogging all your steps\!  
If for the sake of kingship, which the state  
Hath given, unasked for, freely in mine hands,  
Creon the faithful, found mine earliest friend,  
Now seeks with masked attack to drive me forth,  
And hires this wizard, plotter of foul schemes,  
A vagrant mountebank, whose sight is clear  
For pay alone, but in his art stone-blind.  
Is it not so? When wast thou known a seer?  
Why, when the monster with her song was here,  
Didst thou not give our countrymen thy help?  
And yet the riddle lay above the ken  
Of common men, and called for prophet’s skill.  
And this thou show’dst thou hadst not, nor by bird,  
Nor any God made known; but then I came,  
I, Œdipus, who nothing knew, and slew her,  
With mine own counsel winning, all untaught  
By flight of birds. And now thou wouldst expel me,  
And think’st to take thy stand by Creon’s throne.  
But, as I think, both thou and he that plans  
With thee, will to your cost attack my fame;  
And but that thou stand’st there all old and weak,  
Thou shouldst be taught what kind of plans are thine.

 

CHORUS  Far as we dare to measure, both his words  
And thine, O Œdipus, in wrath are said.  
Not such as these we need, but this to see,  
How best to do the bidding of the God.

 

TEIR.  King though thou be, I claim an equal right  
To make reply. Here I call no man lord:  
For I am not thy slave, but Loxias’.  
Nor shall I stand on Creon’s patronage;  
And this I say, since thou hast dared revile  
My blindness, that thou seest, yet dost not see  
Thy evil plight, nor where thou liv’st, nor yet  
With whom thou dwellest, Know’st thou even this,  
Whence thou art sprung? All ignorant thou sinn’st  
Against thine own, the living and the dead.  
And soon a curse from mother and from sire  
With fearful foot shall chase thee forth from us,  
Now seeing all things clear, then all things dark.  
And will not then each shore repeat thy wail,  
And will not old Kithæron echoing ring  
When thou discern’st the marriage, fatal port,  
To which thy prosp’rous voyage brought thy bark?  
And other ills, in countless multitude,  
Thou seest not yet, on thee and on thy seed  
Shall fall alike. Vent forth thy wrath then loud,  
On Creon and on me. There lives not man  
Who wastes his life more wretchedly than thou.

 

ŒDIP.  This can be borne no longer\! Out with thee\!  
A curse light on thee\! Wilt thou not depart?  
Wilt thou not turn and wend thy backward way?

 

TEIR.  I had not come hadst thou not called me here.

 

ŒDIP.  I knew not thou wouldst speak so foolishly;  
Else I had hardly fetched thee to my house.

 

TEIR.  We then, for thee \(so deemest thou\), are fools,  
But, for thy parents, who begot thee, wise.  \[*Turns to go.*

 

ŒDIP.  \[*starting forward*\] What? Stay thy foot. What mortal gave me  
birth?

 

TEIR.  This day shall give thy birth, and work thy doom.

 

ŒDIP.  What riddles dark and dim thou lov’st to speak.

 

TEIR.  Yes. But thy skill excels in solving such.

 

ŒDIP.  Scoff as thou wilt, in this thou’lt find me strong.

 

TEIR.  And yet success in this has worked thy fall.

 

ŒDIP.  I little care, if I have saved the state.

 

TEIR.  Well, then, I go. Do thou, boy, lead me on\!

 

ŒDIP.  Let him lead on. So hateful art thou near,  
Thou canst not pain me more when thou art gone.

 

TEIR.  I go, then, having said the things I came  
To say. No fear of thee compels me. Thine  
Is not the power to hurt me. And I say,  
This man whom thou art seeking out with threats,  
As murderer of Laius, he is here,  
In show an alien sojourner, but in truth  
A home-born Theban. No delight to him  
Will that discovery bring. Blind, having seen,  
Poor, having rolled in wealth, — he, with a staff  
Feeling his way, to other lands shall go\!  
And by his sons shall he be known at once  
Father and brother, and of her who bore him  
Husband and son, sharing his father’s bed,  
His father’s murd’rer. Go thou, then, within,  
And brood o’er this, and, if thou find’st me fail,  
Say that my skill in prophecy is gone.  \[*Exeunt* ŒDIPUS *and* TEIRESIAS.

 

STROPH. I

 

CHORUS  Who was it that the rock oracular  
Of Delphi spake of, working  
With bloody hand his nameless deed of shame?  
Time is it now for him,  
Swifter than fastest steed,  
To bend his course in flight.  
For, in full armour clad,  
Upon him darts, with fire  
And lightning flash, the radiant Son of Zeus.  
And with him come in train the dreaded ones,  
The Destinies that may not be appeased.

 

ANTISTROPH. I

 

For from Parnassus’ heights, enwreathed with snow,  
Gleaming, but now there shone  
The oracle that bade us, one and all,  
Track the unnamed, unknown one.  
For, lo\! he wanders through the forest wild,  
In caves and over rocks,  
As strays the mountain bull,  
In dreary loneliness with dreary tread,  
Seeking in vain to shun  
The words prophetic of the central shrine;  
Yet they around him hover, full of life.

 

STROPH. II

 

Dread things, yea, dread, the augur skilled has stirred  
That leave the question open, aye or no\!  
And which to say I know not,  
But hover still in hopes, and fail to scan  
Things present or to come.  
For neither now nor in the former years  
Learnt I what cause of strife  
Set the Labdacid race  
At variance with the house of Polybus.  
Nor can I test the tale,  
And take my stand against the well-earned fame  
Of Œdipus, my lord,  
As champion of the house of Labdacus,  
For deaths that none may trace\!

 

ANTISTROPH. II

 

For Zeus and King Apollo, they are wise,  
And know the hearts of men:  
But that a prophet passeth me in skill,  
This is no judgment true;  
And one man may another’s wisdom pass,  
By wisdom higher still.  
I, for my part, before the word is clear,  
Will ne’er assent to those that speak in blame.  
’Tis clear, the Maiden-monster with her wings  
Came on him, and he proved by sharpest test  
That he was wise, by all the land beloved,  
And, from my heart at least,  
The charge of baseness comes not.  
*Enter* CREON

 

CREON.  I come, my friends, as having learnt but now  
Our ruler, Œdipus, accuses me  
With dreadful words I cannot bear to hear.  
For if, in these calamities of ours,  
He thinks he suffers wrongly at my hands,  
In word or deed, aught tending to his hurt,  
I set no value on a life prolonged,  
If this reproach hangs on me; for its harm  
Affects not slightly, but is direst shame,  
If through the land my name as villain rings,  
By thee and by thy friends a villain called.

 

CHORUS  But this reproach, it may be, came from wrath  
All hasty, rather than from judgment calm.

 

CREON.  And who informed him that the seer, seduced  
By my false counsel, spoke his lying words?

 

CHORUS  The words were said, but on what grounds I know not.

 

CREON.  And was it with calm eyes and judgment clear,  
The charge was brought against my name and fame?

 

CHORUS  I cannot say. To what our rulers do  
I close my eyes. But here he comes himself.  
*Enter* ŒDIPUS

 

ŒDIP.  Ho, there\! is’t thou? And does thy boldness soar  
So shameless as to come beneath my roof,  
When thou, ’tis clear, hast done the deed of blood,  
And now wilt rob me of my sovereignty?  
Is it, by all the Gods, that thou hast seen  
Or cowardice or folly in my soul,  
That thou hast laid thy plans? Or thoughtest thou  
That I should neither see thy sinuous wiles,  
Nor, knowing, ward them off? This scheme of thine,  
Is it not wild, backed nor by force nor friends,  
To seek the power which calls for force or wealth?

 

CREON.  Do as thou pleasest. But for words of scorn  
Hear like words back, and as thou hearest, judge.

 

ŒDIP.  Cunning of speech art thou\! But I am slow  
To learn of thee, whom I have found my foe.

 

CREON.  Hear this, then, first, that thus I have to speak….

 

ŒDIP.  But this, then, say not, that thou art not vile.

 

CREON.  If that thou thinkest self-willed pride avails,  
Apart from judgment, know thou art not wise.

 

ŒDIP.  If that thou thinkest, injuring thy friend,  
To do it unchastised, thou art not wise.

 

CREON.  In this, I grant, thou speakest right; but tell,  
What form of suffering hast thou to endure?

 

ŒDIP.  Didst thou, or didst thou not, thy counsel give  
Some one to send to fetch this reverend seer?

 

CREON.  And even now by that advice I hold\!

 

ŒDIP.  How long a time has passed since Laius  
chanced…  \[*Pauses.*

 

CREON.  Chanced to do what? I understand not yet.

 

ŒDIP.  Since he was smitten with the deadly blow?

 

CREON.  The years would measure out a long, long tale.

 

ŒDIP.  And was this seer then practising his art?

 

CREON.  Full wise as now, and equal in repute.

 

ŒDIP.  Did he at that time say a word of me?

 

CREON.  No word, while I, at any rate, was by.

 

ŒDIP.  And yet ye held your quest upon the dead?

 

CREON.  Of course we held it, but we nothing heard.

 

ŒDIP.  How was it he, the wise one, spoke not then?

 

CREON.  I know not, and, not knowing, hold my peace.

 

ŒDIP.  One thing thou know’st, and, meaning well, wouldst speak\!

 

CREON.  And what is that? for if I know, I’ll speak.

 

ŒDIP.  Why, unless thou wert in the secret, then  
He spake not of me as the murderer.

 

CREON.  If he says this, thou know’st it. I of thee  
Desire to learn, as thou hast learnt of me.

 

ŒDIP.  Learn then; no guilt of blood shall rest on me.

 

CREON.  Well, then, — my sister? dost thou own her wife?

 

ŒDIP.  I will not meet this question with denial.

 

CREON.  And sharest thou an equal rule with her?

 

ŒDIP.  Her every wish by me is brought to act.

 

CREON.  And am not I co-equal with you twain?

 

ŒDIP.  Yes; and just here thou show’st thyself false friend.

 

CREON.  Not so, if thou wouldst reason with thyself,  
As I must reason. First reflect on this:  
Supposest thou that one would rather choose  
To reign with fears than sleeping calmest sleep,  
His power being equal? I, for one, prize less  
The name of king than deeds of kingly power;  
And so would all who learn in wisdom’s school.  
Now without fear I have what I desire,  
At thy hand given. Did I rule, myself,  
I might do much unwillingly. Why, then,  
Should sovereignty exert a softer charm  
Than power and might unchequered by a care?  
I am not yet so cheated by myself  
As to desire aught else but honest gain.  
Now all goes well, now every one salutes,  
Now they who seek thy favour court my smiles,  
For on this hinge does all their fortune turn.  
Why, then, should I leave this to hunt for that?  
My mind, retaining reason, ne’er could act  
The villain’s part. I was not born to love  
Such thoughts myself, nor bear with those that do.  
And as a proof of this, go thou thyself,  
And ask at Pytho whether I brought back,  
In very deed, the oracles I heard.  
And if thou find me plotting with the seer,  
In common concert, not by one decree,  
But two, thine own and mine, proclaim my death.  
But charge me not with crime on shadowy proof;  
For neither is it just, in random thought,  
The bad to count as good, nor good as bad;  
For to thrust out a friend of noble heart,  
Is like the parting with the life we love.  
And this in time thou’lt know, for time alone  
Makes manifest the righteous. Of the vile  
Thou mayst detect the vileness in a day.

 

CHORUS  To one who fears to fall, he speaketh well;  
O king, swift counsels are not always safe.

 

ŒDIP.  But when a man is swift in wily schemes,  
Swift must I be to baffle plot with plot;  
And if I stand and wait, he wins the day,  
And all my life is found one great mistake.

 

CREON.  What seek’st thou, then? to drive me from the land?

 

ŒDIP.  Not so. I seek not banishment, but death.

 

CREON.  When thou show’st first what grudge I bear to thee?

 

ŒDIP.  And say’st thou this defying, yielding not?

 

CREON.  I see thy judgment fails.

 

ŒDIP.  I hold mine own.

 

CREON.  Mine has an equal claim.

 

ŒDIP.  Thou villain born\!

 

CREON.  And if thy mind is darkened…?

 

ŒDIP.  Still obey\!

 

CREON.  Not to a tyrant ruler.

 

ŒDIP.  O my country\!

 

CREON.  I, too, can claim that country. ’Tis not thine\!

 

CHORUS  Cease, O my princes\! In good time I see  
Jocasta coming hither from the house;  
And it were well with her to hush this strife.  
*Enter* JOCASTA

 

JOC.  Why, O ye wretched ones, this strife of tongues  
Raise ye in your unwisdom, nor are shamed,  
Our country suffering, private griefs to stir?  
Come thou within. And thou, O Creon, go,  
Nor bring a trifling sore to mischief great\!

 

CREON.  My sister\! Œdipus, thy husband, claims  
The right to wrong me, giving choice of ills,  
Or to be exiled from my home, or die.

 

ŒDIP.  ’Tis even so, for I have found him, wife,  
Against my life his evil wiles devising.

 

CREON.  May I ne’er prosper, but accursed die,  
If I have done the things he says I did\!

 

JOC.  Oh, by the Gods, believe him, Œdipus\!  
Respect his oath, which calls the Gods to hear;  
And reverence me, and these who stand by thee.

 

CHORUS  Hearken, my king\! be calmer, I implore\!

 

ŒDIP.  What\! wilt thou that I yield?

 

CHORUS  Respect is due  
To one not weak before, who now is strong  
In this his oath.

 

ŒDIP.  And know’st thou what thou ask’st?

 

CHORUS  I know right well.

 

ŒDIP.  Say on, then, what thou wilt.

 

CHORUS  Hurl not to shame, on grounds of mere mistrust,  
The friend on whom his own curse still must hang.

 

ŒDIP.  Know, then, that, seeking this, thou seek’st, in truth,  
To work my death, or else my banishment.

 

CHORUS  Nay, by the sun, chief God of all the Gods\!  
May I, too, die, of God and man accursed,  
If I wish aught like this\! But on my soul,  
Our wasting land dwells heavily; ills on ills  
Still coming, and your strife embittering all.

 

ŒDIP.  Let him depart, then, even though I die,  
Or from my country wander forth in shame:  
Thy face, not his, I view with pitying eye;  
For him, where’er he be, is naught but hate.

 

CREON.  Thou’rt loath to yield, ’twould seem, and wilt be vexed  
When this thy wrath is over: moods like thine  
Are fitly to themselves most hard to bear.

 

ŒDIP.  Wilt thou not go, and leave me?

 

CREON.  I will go,  
By thee misjudged, but known as just by these.  \[*Exit.*

 

CHORUS  Why, lady, art thou slow to lead him in?

 

JOC.  I fain would learn how this sad chance arose.

 

CHORUS  Blind hasty speech there was, and wrong will sting.

 

JOC.  From both of them?

 

CHORUS  Yea, both.

 

JOC.  And what said each?

 

CHORUS  Enough for me, our land laid low in grief,  
It seems, to leave the quarrel where it stopped.

 

ŒDIP.  Seest thou, with all thy purposes of good,  
Thy shifting and thy soothing, what thou dost?

 

CHORUS  My chief, not once alone I spoke,  
And wild and erring should I be,  
Were I to turn from thee aside,  
Who, when my country rocked in storm,  
Righted her course, and, if thou couldst,  
Wouldst send her speeding now.

 

JOC.  Tell me, my king, what cause of fell debate  
Has bred this discord, and provoked thy soul.

 

ŒDIP.  Thee will I tell, for thee I honour more  
Than these. The cause was Creon and his plots.

 

JOC.  Say, then, if clearly thou canst tell the strife.

 

ŒDIP.  He says that I am Laius’ murderer.

 

JOC.  Of his own knowledge, or by some one taught?

 

ŒDIP.  Yon scoundrel seer suborning. For himself,  
He takes good care to free his lips from blame.

 

JOC.  Leave now thyself, and all thy thoughts of this,  
And list to me, and learn how little skill  
In arts prophetic mortal man may claim;  
And of this truth I’ll give thee proof full clear.  
There came to Laius once an oracle  
\(I say not that it came from Phœbus’ self,  
But from his servants\) that his fate was fixed  
By his son’s hand to fall — his own and mine:  
And him, so rumour runs, a robber band  
Of aliens slew, where meet the three great roads.  
Nor did three days succeed the infant’s birth,  
Before, by other hands, he cast him forth,  
Maiming his ankles, on a lonely hill.  
Here, then, Apollo failed to make the boy  
His father’s murderer; nor did Laius die  
By his son’s hand. So fared the oracles;  
Therefore regard them not. Whate’er the God  
Desires to search he will himself declare.

 

ŒDIP.  \[*trembling*\] O what a fearful boding\! thoughts disturbed  
Thrill through my soul, my queen, at this thy tale.

 

JOC.  What means this shuddering, this averted glance?

 

ŒDIP.  I thought I heard thee say that Laius died,  
Slain in a skirmish where the three roads meet?

 

JOC.  So was it said, and still the rumours hold.

 

ŒDIP.  Where was the spot in which this matter passed?

 

JOC.  They call the country Phocis, and the roads  
From Delphi and from Daulia there converge.

 

ŒDIP.  And time? what interval has passed since then?

 

JOC.  But just before thou camest to possess  
And rule this land the tidings were proclaimed.

 

ŒDIP.  Great Zeus\! what fate hast thou decreed for me?

 

JOC.  What thought is this, my Œdipus, of thine?

 

ŒDIP.  Ask me not yet, but tell of Laius’ frame,  
His build, his features, and his years of life.

 

JOC.  Tall was he, and the white hairs snowed his head,  
And in his face not much unlike to thee.

 

ŒDIP.  Woe, woe is me\! so seems it I have plunged  
All blindly into curses terrible.

 

JOC.  What sayest thou? I shudder as I see thee.

 

ŒDIP.  Desponding fear comes o’er me, lest the seer  
Has seen indeed. But one thing more I’ll ask.

 

JOC.  I fear to speak, yet what thou ask’st I’ll tell.

 

ŒDIP.  Went he in humble guise, or with a troop  
Of spearmen, as becomes a man that rules?

 

JOC.  Five were they altogether, and of them  
One was a herald, and one chariot had he.

 

ŒDIP.  Woe\! woe\! ’tis all too clear. And who was he  
That told these tidings to thee, O my queen?

 

JOC.  A servant who alone escaped with life.

 

ŒDIP.  And does he chance to dwell among us now?

 

JOC.  Not so; for from the time when he returned,  
And found thee bearing sway, and Laius dead,  
He, at my hand, a suppliant, implored  
This boon, to send him to the distant fields  
To feed his flocks, where never glance of his  
Might Thebes behold. And so I sent him forth;  
For though a slave he might have claimed yet more.

 

ŒDIP.  And could we fetch him quickly back again?

 

JOC.  That may well be. But why dost thou wish this?

 

ŒDIP.  I fear, O queen, that words best left unsaid  
Have passed these lips, and therefore wish to see him.

 

JOC.  Well, he shall come. But some small claim have I,  
O king, to learn what touches thee with woe.

 

ŒDIP.  Thou shalt not fail to learn it, now that I  
Have such forebodings reached. To whom should I  
More than to thee tell all the passing chance?  
I had a father, Polybus of Corinth,  
And Merope of Doris was my mother,  
And I was held in honour by the rest  
Who dwelt there, till this accident befel,  
Worthy of wonder, of the heat unworthy  
It roused within me. Thus it chanced: A man  
At supper, in his cups, with wine o’ertaken,  
Reviles me as a spurious changeling boy;  
And I, sore vexed, hardly for that day  
Restrained myself. And when the morrow came  
I went and charged my father and my mother  
With what I thus had heard. They heaped reproach  
On him who stirred the matter, and I soothed  
My soul with what they told me; yet it teased,  
Still vexing more and more; and so I went,  
Unknown to them, to Pytho, and the God  
Sent me forth shamed, unanswered in my quest;  
And more he added, dread and dire and dark,  
How that the doom of incest lay on me,  
Most foul, unnatural; and that I should be  
Father of children men would loathe to look on,  
And murderer of the father that begot me.  
And, hearing this, I cast my wistful looks  
To where the stars hang over Corinth’s towers,  
And fled where nevermore mine eyes might see  
The shame of those dire oracles fulfilled;  
And as I went I reached the spot where he,  
The king, thou tell’st me, met the fatal blow.  
And now, O lady, I will tell thee all.  
Wending my steps that way where three roads meet,  
There met me first a herald, and a man  
Like him thou told’st of, riding on his car,  
Drawn by young colts. With rough and hasty words  
They drove me from the road, — the driver first,  
And that old man himself; and then in rage  
I struck the driver, who had turned me back.  
And when the old man saw it, watching me  
As by the chariot side I stood, he struck  
My forehead with a double-pointed goad.  
But we were more than quits, for in a trice  
With this right hand I struck him with my staff,  
And he rolled backward from his chariot’s seat.  
And then I slew them all. And if it chance  
That Laius and this stranger are akin,  
What man more wretched than this man who speaks,  
What man more harassed by the vexing Gods?  
He whom none now, or alien, or of Thebes,  
May welcome to their house, or speak to him,  
But thrust him forth an exile. And ’twas I,  
None other, who against myself proclaimed  
These curses. And the bed of him that died  
I with my hands, by which he fell, defile.  
Am I not vile by nature, all unclean?  
If I must flee, yet still in flight my doom  
Is nevermore to see the friends I love,  
Nor tread my country’s soil; or else to bear  
The guilt of incest, and my father slay,  
Yea, Polybus, who reared me from the womb.  
Would not a man say right who said that here  
Some cruel God was pressing hard on me?  
Not that, not that, at least, thou Presence, pure  
And awful, of the Gods. May I ne’er look  
On such a day as that, but far away  
Depart unseen from all the haunts of men  
Before such great pollution comes on me.

 

CHORUS  Us, too, O king, these things perplex, yet still,  
Till thou hast asked the man who then was by,’  
Have hope.

 

ŒDIP.  And this indeed is all my hope,  
Waiting until that shepherd-slave appear.

 

JOC.  And when he comes, what meanest thou to ask?

 

ŒDIP.  I’ll tell thee. Should he now repeat the tale  
Thou told’st to me, it frees me from this guilt.

 

JOC.  What special word was that thou heard’st from me?

 

ŒDIP.  Thou said’st he told that robbers slew his lord,  
And should he give their number as the same  
Now as before, it was not I who slew him,  
For one man could not be the same as many.  
But if he speak of one man, all alone,  
Then, all too plain, the deed cleaves fast to me.

 

JOC.  But know, the thing was said, and clearly said,  
And now he cannot from his word draw back.  
Not I alone, but the whole city, heard it;  
And should he now retract his former tale,  
Not then, my husband, will he rightly show  
The death of Laius, who, as Loxias told,  
By my son’s hand should die; and yet, poor boy,  
He killed him not, but perished long ago.  
So I for one, both now and evermore,  
Will count all oracles as things of naught.

 

ŒDIP.  Thou reasonest well. Yet send a messenger  
To fetch that peasant. Be not slack in this.

 

JOC.  I will make haste to send. But go thou in;  
I would do nothing that displeaseth thee.  \[*Exeunt.*

 

STROPH. I

 

CHORUS  O that my fate were fixed  
To live in holy purity of speech,  
Pure in all deeds whose laws stand firm and high,  
In heaven’s clear æther born,  
Of whom Olympus only is the sire,  
Whom man’s frail flesh begat not,  
Nor ever shall forgetfulness o’erwhelm;  
In them our God is great and grows not old.

 

ANTISTROPH. I

 

But pride begets the mood of tyrant power;  
Pride filled with many thoughts, yet filled in vain,  
Untimely, ill-advised,  
Scaling the topmost height,  
Falls down the steep abyss,  
Down to the pit, where step that profiteth  
It seeks in vain to take.  
I cannot ask the Gods to stop midway  
The conflict sore that works our country’s good;  
I cannot cease to call on God for aid.

 

STROPH. II

 

But if there be who walketh haughtily,  
In action or in speech,  
Whom righteousness herself has ceased to awe,  
Who counts the temples of the Gods profane,  
An evil fate be his,  
Fit meed for all his boastfulness of heart;  
Unless in time to come he gain his gains  
All justly, and draws back from godless deeds,  
Nor lays rash hand upon the holy things,  
By man inviolable.  
If such deeds prosper who will henceforth pray  
To guard his soul from passion’s fiery darts?  
If such as these are held in high repute,  
What profit is there of my choral strain?

 

ANTISTROPH. II

 

No longer will I go in pilgrim guise,  
To yon all holy place, Earth’s central shrine,  
Nor unto Abae’s temple,  
Nor to far-famed Olympia,  
Unless these pointings of a hand divine  
In sight of all men stand out clear and true.  
But, O thou sovereign ruler\! if that name,

 

O Zeus, belongs to thee, who reign’st o’er all,  
Let not this trespass hide itself from thee,  
Or thine undying sway;  
For now they set at naught  
The oracles, half dead,  
That Laius heard of old,  
And king Apollo’s wonted worship flags,  
And all to wreck is gone  
The homage due to God.  
*Enter* JOCASTA, *followed by an* Attendant

 

JOC.  Princes of this our land, across my soul  
There comes the thought to go from shrine to shrine  
Of all the Gods, these garlands in my hand,  
And waving incense; for our Œdipus  
Vexes his soul too wildly with his woes,  
And speaks not as a man should speak who scans  
The present by the experience of the past,  
But hangs on every breath that tells of fear.  
And since I find that my advice avails not,  
To thee, Lyceian King, Apollo, first  
I come, — for thou art nearest, — suppliant  
With these devotions, trusting thou wilt work  
Some way of healing for us, free from guilt;  
For now we shudder, all of us, seeing him,  
The good ship’s pilot, panic-struck and lost.  
*Enter* MESSENGER

 

MESS.  May I inquire of you, O strangers, where  
To find the house of Œdipus the king,  
And, above all, where he is, if ye know?

 

CHORUS  This is the house, and he, good sir, within,  
And this his wife, and mother of his children.

 

MESS.  Good fortune be with her and all her kin,  
Being, as she is, his true and honoured wife.

 

JOC.  Like fortune be with thee, my friend. Thy speech,  
So kind, deserves no less. But tell me why  
Thou comest, what thou hast to ask or tell.

 

MESS.  Good news to thee, and to thy husband, lady.

 

JOC.  What is it, then? and who has sent thee here?

 

MESS.  I come from Corinth, and the news I’ll tell  
May give thee joy. Why not? Yet thou mayst grieve.

 

JOC.  What is the news that has this twofold power?

 

MESS.  The citizens that on these Isthmus dwell  
Will make him sovereign. So the rumour ran.

 

JOC.  What then? Is aged Polybus no more?

 

MESS.  E’en so. Death holds him in the stately tomb.

 

JOC.  What say’st thou? Polybus, thy king, is dead?

 

MESS.  If I speak false, I have no wish to live\!

 

JOC.  Go, maiden, at thy topmost speed, and tell  
Thy master this. Now, oracles of Gods,  
Where are ye now? Long since my Œdipus  
Fled, fearing lest his hand should slay the man;  
And now he dies by fate, and not by him.  
*Enter* ŒDIPUS

 

ŒDIP.  Mine own Jocasta, why, O dearest one,  
Why hast thou sent to fetch me from the house?

 

JOC.  List this man’s tale, and when thou hearest, see  
The woeful plight of those dread oracles.

 

ŒDIP.  Who, then, is this, and what has he to tell?

 

JOC.  He comes from Corinth, and he brings thee word  
That Polybus, thy father, lives no more.

 

ŒDIP.  What say’st thou, friend? Tell me thy tale thyself.

 

MESS.  If I must needs report the story clear,  
Know well that he has gone the way of death.

 

ŒDIP.  Was it by plot, or chance of natural death?

 

MESS.  An old man’s frame a little stroke lays low\!

 

ŒDIP.  He suffered, then, it seems, from some disease?

 

MESS.  E’en so, and many a weary month he passed.

 

ŒDIP.  Ha\! ha\! Why now, my queen, should we regard  
The Pythian hearth oracular, or birds  
In mid-air crying? By their auguries,  
I was to slay my father. And he dies,  
And the grave hides him; and I find myself  
Handling no sword; unless for love of me  
He pined away, and so I caused his death.  
So Polybus is gone, and with him lie,  
In Hades whelmed, those worthless oracles.

 

JOC.  Did I not tell thee this long time ago?

 

ŒDIP.  Thou didst, but I was led away by fears.

 

JOC.  Dismiss them, then, for ever from thy thoughts\!

 

ŒDIP.  And yet that “incest”; must I not fear that?

 

JOC.  Why should we fear, when chance rules everything,  
And foresight of the future there is none;  
’Tis best to live at random, as one can.  
But thou, fear not that marriage with thy mother:  
Such things men oft have dreams of; but who cares  
The least about them lives the happiest.

 

ŒDIP.  Right well thou speakest all things, save that she  
Still lives that bore me, and I can but fear,  
Seeing that she lives, although thou speakest well.

 

JOC.  And yet thy father’s grave’s a spot of light.

 

ŒDIP.  ’Tis so: yet while she liveth there is fear.

 

MESS.  Who is this woman about whom ye fear?

 

ŒDIP.  ’Tis Merope, old sir, who lived with Polybus.

 

MESS.  And what leads you to think of her with fear?

 

ŒDIP.  A fearful oracle, my friend, from God.

 

MESS.  Canst tell it; or must others ask in vain?

 

ŒDIP.  Most readily; for Loxias said of old  
The doom of incest lay on me, and I  
With mine own hands should spill my father’s blood.  
And therefore Corinth long ago I left,  
And journeyed far, right prosperously I own; —   
And yet ’tis sweet to see a parent’s face.

 

MESS.  And did this fear thy steps to exile lead?

 

ŒDIP.  I did not wish to take my father’s life.

 

MESS.  Why, the, O king, did I who came with good  
Not free thee from this fear that haunts thy soul?

 

ŒDIP.  For this, I own, I owe thee worthy thanks.

 

MESS.  For this, *I* own, I chiefly came to thee;  
That I on thy return may prosper well.

 

ŒDIP.  But I return not while a parent lives.

 

MESS.  ’Tis clear, my son, thou know’st not what thou dost.

 

ŒDIP.  What is’t? By all the Gods, old man, speak out.

 

MESS.  If ’tis for them thou fearest to return…

 

ŒDIP.  I fear lest Phœbus prove himself too true.

 

MESS.  Is it lest thou shouldst stain thy soul through them?

 

ŒDIP.  This selfsame fear, old man, for ever haunts me.

 

MESS.  And know’st thou not there is no cause for fear?

 

ŒDIP.  Is there no cause if I was born their son?

 

MESS.  None is there. Polybus is naught to thee.

 

ŒDIP.  What say’st thou? Did not Polybus beget me?

 

MESS.  No more than he thou speak’st to; just as much.

 

ŒDIP.  How could a father’s claim become as naught?

 

MESS.  Well, neither he begat thee nor did I.

 

ŒDIP.  Why, then, did he acknowledge me as his?

 

MESS.  He at my hands received thee as a gift.

 

ŒDIP.  And could he love another’s child so much?

 

MESS.  Yes; for this former childlessness wrought on him.

 

ŒDIP.  And gav’st thou me as buying or as finding?

 

MESS.  I found thee in Kithæron’s shrub-grown hollow.

 

ŒDIP.  And for what cause didst travel thitherwards?

 

MESS.  I had the charge to tend the mountain flocks.

 

ŒDIP.  Was thou a shepherd born, or seeking hire?

 

MESS.  At any rate, my son, I saved thee then.

 

ŒDIP.  What evil, plight, then, didst thou find me in?

 

MESS.  The sinews of thy feet would tell that tale.

 

ŒDIP.  Ah, me\! why speak’st thou of that ancient wrong?

 

MESS.  I freed thee when thy insteps both were pierced.

 

ŒDIP.  A foul disgrace I had in swaddling clothes.

 

MESS.  Thus from his chance there came the name thou bearest.

 

ŒDIP.  \[*starting*\] Who gave the name, my father or my mother;  
In heaven’s name tell me?

 

MESS.  This I do not know;  
Who gave thee to me better knows than I.

 

ŒDIP.  Didst thou, then, take me from another’s hand,  
Not finding me thyself?

 

MESS.  Not I, indeed;  
Another shepherd made a gift of thee.

 

ŒDIP.  Who was he? know’st thou where to find him out?

 

MESS.  They called him one of those that Laius owned.

 

ŒDIP.  Mean’s thou the former sovereign of this land?

 

MESS.  E’en so. He fed the flocks of him thou nam’st.

 

ŒDIP.  And is he living still that I might see him?

 

MESS.  You, his own countrymen, should know that best.

 

ŒDIP.  Is there of you who stand and listen here  
One who has known the shepherd that he tells of,  
Or seeing him upon the hills or here?  
If so, declare it; ’tis full time to speak\!

 

CHORUS  I think that this is he whom from the hills  
But now thou soughtest. But Jocasta here  
Could tell thee this with surer word than I.

 

ŒDIP.  Knowest thou, my queen, the man whom late we sent  
To fetch; and him of whom this stranger speaks?

 

JOC.  \[*with forced calmness*\] Whom did he speak of? Care not thou for it,  
But wish his words may be but idle tales.

 

ŒDIP.  I cannot fail, once getting on the scent,  
To track at last the secret of my birth.

 

JOC.  Ah, by the Gods, if that thou valuest life  
Inquire no further. Let my woe suffice.

 

ŒDIP.  Take heart; though I should turn out thrice a slave,  
Born of a thrice vile mother, thou art still  
Free from all stain.

 

JOC.  Yet, I implore thee, pause\!  
Yield to my counsels, do not do this deed.

 

ŒDIP.  I may not yield, and fail to search it out.

 

JOC.  And yet good counsels give I, for thy good.

 

ŒDIP.  This “for my good” has been my life’s long plague.

 

JOC.  Who thou art, hapless, mayst thou never know\!

 

ŒDIP.  Will some one bring that shepherd to me here?  
Leave her to glory in her high descent.

 

JOC.  Woe\! woe\! ill-fated one\! my last word this,  
This only, and no more for evermore.  \[*Rushes out.*

 

CHORUS  Why has thy queen, O Œdipus, gone forth  
In her wild sorrow rushing. Much I fear  
Lest from such silence evil deeds burst out.

 

ŒDIP.  Burst out what will, I seek to know my birth,  
Low though it be, and she perhaps is shamed  
\(For, like a woman, she is proud of heart\)  
At thoughts of my low birth; but I, who count  
Myself the child of Fortune, fear no shame.  
My mother she, and she has prospered me.  
And so the months that span my life have made me  
Both high and low; but whatsoe’er I be,  
Such as I am I am, and needs must on  
To fathom all the secret of my birth.

 

STROPH

 

CHORUS  If the seer’s gift be mine,  
Or skill in counsel wise,  
Thou, O Kithæron, when the morrow comes,  
Our full-moon festival,  
Shalt fail not to resound  
The voice that greets thee, fellow-citizen,  
Parent and nurse of Œdipus;  
And we will on thee weave our choral dance,  
As bringing to our princes glad good news.  
Hail, hail\! O Phœbus, smile on this our prayer.

 

ANTISTROPH

 

Who was it, child, that bore thee?  
Blest daughter of the ever-living Ones,  
Or meeting in the ties of love with Pan,  
Who wanders o’er the hills,  
Or with thee, Loxias, for to thee are dear  
All the high lawns where roam the pasturing flocks;  
Or was it he who rules Kyllene’s height;  
Or did the Bacchic God,  
Upon the mountain’s peak,  
Receive thee as the gift of some fair nymph  
Of Helicon’s fair band,  
With whom he sports and wantons evermore?

 

ŒDIP.  If I must needs conjecture, who as yet  
Ne’er met the man, I think I see the shepherd,  
Whom this long while we sought for. With the years  
His age fits well. And now I see, besides,  
My servants bring him. Thou perchance canst say  
From former knowledge yet more certainly.

 

CHORUS  I know him well, O king\! For this man stood,  
If any, known as Laius’ faithful slave.  
*Enter* Shepherd

 

ŒDIP.  Thee first I ask, Corinthian stranger, say,  
Is this the man?

 

MESS.  The very man thou seek’st.

 

ŒDIP.  Ho, there, old man. Come hither, look on me,  
And tell me all. Did Laius own thee once?

 

SHEP  Not as a slave from market, but home-reared.

 

ŒDIP.  What was thy work, or what thy mode of life?

 

SHEP  Near all my life I followed with the flock.

 

ŒDIP.  And in what regions didst thou chiefly dwell?

 

SHEP  Now ’twas Kithæron, now on neighbouring fields.

 

ŒDIP.  Know’st thou this man? Didst ever see him there?

 

SHEP  What did he do? Of what man speakest thou?

 

ŒDIP.  This man now present. Did ye ever meet?

 

SHEP  My memory fails when taxed thus suddenly.

 

MESS.  No wonder that, my lord. But I’ll remind him  
Right well of things forgotten. Well I know  
He’ll call to mind when on Kithæron’s fields,  
He with a double flock, and I with one,  
I was his neighbour during three half years,  
From springtide on to autumn; and in winter  
I drove my flocks to mine own fold, and he  
To those of Laius. \[*To* SHEPHERD\] Is this false or true?

 

SHEP  Thou tell’st the truth, although long years have passed.

 

MESS.  Come, then, say, on. Rememberest thou a boy  
Thou gav’st me once, that I might rear him up  
As mine own child?

 

SHEP  Why askest thou of this?

 

MESS.  Here stands he, fellow\! that same tiny boy\!

 

SHEP  A curse befall thee\! Wilt not hold thy tongue?

 

ŒDIP.  Rebuke him not, old man; thy words need more  
The language of reproaches than do his.

 

SHEP  Say, good my lord, what fault have I committed?

 

ŒDIP.  This, that thou tell’st not of the child he asks for.

 

SHEP  Yes, for he speaks in blindness, wasting breath.

 

ŒDIP.  Thou wilt not speak for favour, but a blow…  \[*Strikes him.*

 

SHEP  By all the Gods, hurt not my feeble age.

 

ŒDIP.  Will no one bind his hands behind his back?

 

SHEP  O man most wretched\! what, then, wilt thou learn?

 

ŒDIP.  Gav’st thou this man the boy of whom he asks?

 

SHEP  I gave him. Would that day had been my last\!

 

ŒDIP.  That doom will soon be thine if thou speak’st wrong.

 

SHEP  Nay, much more shall I perish if I speak.

 

ŒDIP.  This fellow, as it seems, would tire us out.

 

SHEP  Not so. I said long since I gave it him.

 

ŒDIP.  Whence came it? Was the child thine own or not?

 

SHEP  Mine own ’twas not, but some one gave it me,

 

ŒDIP.  Which of our people, or beneath what roof?

 

SHEP  Oh, by the Gods, my master, ask no more\!

 

ŒDIP.  Thou diest if I question this again.

 

SHEP  Some one it was in Laius’ household born.

 

ŒDIP.  Was it a slave, or some one born to him?

 

SHEP  Ah, me\! I stand upon the very brink  
Where most I dread to speak.

 

ŒDIP.  And I to hear:  
And yet I needs must hear it, come what may.

 

SHEP  The boy was said to be his son; but she,  
Thy queen within, could tell thee best the truth.

 

ŒDIP.  What\! was it she who gave it?

 

SHEP  Yea, O king\!

 

ŒDIP.  And to what end?

 

SHEP  To make away with it.

 

ŒDIP.  And dared a mother…?

 

SHEP  Evil doom she feared.

 

ŒDIP.  What doom?

 

SHEP  ’Twas said that he his sire should kill.

 

ŒDIP.  Why, then, didst thou to this old man resign him?

 

SHEP  I pitied him, O master, and I thought  
That he would bear him to another land,  
Whence he himself had come. But him he saved  
For direst evil. For if thou be he  
Whom this man speaks of, thou art born to ill.

 

ŒDIP.  Woe\! woe\! woe\! woe\! all cometh clear at last.  
O light, may I ne’er look on thee again,  
Who now am seen owing my birth to those  
To whom I ought not, and with whom I ought not  
In wedlock living, whom I ought not slaying.  \[*Exit.*

 

STROPH. I

 

CHORUS  Ah, race of mortal men,  
How as a thing of naught  
I count ye, though ye live;  
For who is there of men  
That more of blessing knows  
Than just a little while  
In a vain show to stand,  
And, having stood, to fall?  
With thee before mine eyes,  
Thy destiny, e’en thine,  
Ill-fated Œdipus,  
I can count no man blest.

 

ANTISTROPH. I

 

For thou, with wondrous skill,  
Taking thine aim, didst hit  
Success, in all things prosperous;  
And didst, O Zeus\! destroy  
The Virgin with her talons bent,  
And sayings wild and dark;  
And against many deaths  
A tower and strong defence  
Didst for my country rise;  
And therefore dost thou bear the name of king,  
With highest glory crowned,  
Ruling in mighty Thebes.

 

STROPH. II

 

And now, who lives than thou more miserable?  
Who equals thee in wild woes manifold,  
In shifting turns of life?  
Ah, noble one, our Œdipus\!  
For whom the selfsame port  
Sufficed for sire and son,  
In wedlock’s haven met:  
Ah how, ah how, thou wretched one, so long  
Could that incestuous bed  
Receive thee, and be dumb?

 

ANTISTROPH. II

 

Time, who sees all things, he hath found thee out,  
Against thy will, and long ago condemned  
The wedlock none may wed,  
Begetter and begotten  
In strange confusion joined.  
Ah, child of Laius\! ah\!  
Would that I ne’er had looked upon thy face\!  
For I mourn sore exceedingly,  
From lips with wailing full.  
In simplest truth, by thee I rose from death,  
By thee I close mine eyes in deadly sleep.  
*Enter* Second Messenger

 

SEC. MESS.  Ye chieftains, honoured most in this our land,  
For all the deeds ye hear of, all ye see,  
How great a wailing will ye raise, if still  
Ye truly love the house of Labdacus;  
For sure I think that neither Ister’s stream  
Nor Phasis’ floods could purify this house,  
Such horrors does it hold. But all too soon,  
Will we or will we not, they’ll come to light.  
Self-chosen sorrows ever pain men most.

 

CHORUS  The ills we knew before lacked nothing meet  
For plaint and moaning. Now, what add’st thou more?

 

SEC. MESS.  Quickest for me to speak, and thee to learn;  
Our godlike queen Jocasta — she is dead.

 

CHORUS  Ah, crushed with many sorrows\! How and why?

 

SEC. MESS.  Herself she slew. The worst of all that passed  
I must pass o’er, for none were there to see.  
Yet, far as memory suffers me to speak,  
That sorrow-stricken woman’s end I’ll tell;  
How, yielding to her passion, on she passed  
Within the porch, made straightway for the couch,  
Her bridal bed, with both hands tore her hair,  
And as she entered, dashing through the doors,  
Calls on her Laius, dead long years ago,  
Remembering all that birth of long ago,  
Which brought him death, and left to her who bore,  
With his own son a hateful motherhood.  
And o’er her bed she wailed, where she had borne  
Spouse to her spouse, and children to her child;  
And how she perished after this I know not;  
For Œdipus struck in with woeful cry,  
And we no longer looked upon her fate,  
But gazed on him as to and fro he rushed,  
For so he comes, and asks us for a sword,  
Wherewith to smite the wife that wife was none,  
The bosom stained by those accursed births,  
Himself, his children — so, as thus he raves,  
Some spirit shows her to him \(none of us  
Who stood hard by had done so\): with a shout  
Most terrible, as some one led him on,  
Through the two gates he leapt, and from the hasp  
He slid the hollow bolt, and falls within;  
And there we saw his wife had hung herself,  
By twisted cords suspended. When her form  
He saw, poor wretch\! with one wild, fearful cry,  
The twisted rope he loosens, and she fell,  
Ill-starred one, on the ground. Then came a sight  
Most fearful. Tearing from her robe the clasps,  
All chased with gold, with which she decked herself,  
He with them struck the pupils of his eyes,  
Such words as these exclaiming: “They should see  
No more the ills he suffered or had done;  
But in the dark should look, in time to come,  
On those they ought not, not know whom they would.”  
With such like wails, not once or twice alone,  
Raising the lids, he tore his eyes, and they,  
All bleeding, stained his cheek, nor ceased to pour  
Thick clots of gore, but still the purple shower  
Fell fast and full, a very rain of blood.  
Such were the ills that fell on both of them,  
Not on one only, wife and husband both.  
His former fortune, which he held of old,  
Was rightly honoured; but for this day’s doom  
Wailing and woe, and death and shame, all forms  
That man can name of evil, none have failed.

 

CHORUS  And hath the wretched man a pause of ill?

 

SEC. MESS.  He calls to us to ope the gates, and show  
To all in Thebes his father’s murderer,  
His mother’s… Foul and fearful were the words  
He spoke. I dare not speak them. Then he said  
That he would cast himself adrift, nor stay  
At home accursèd, as himself had cursed.  
Some stay he surely needs, or guiding hand,  
For greater is the ill than he can bear,  
And this he soon will show thee, for the bolts  
Of the two gates are opening, and thou’lt see  
A sight to touch e’en hatred’s self with pity.  
*The doors of the Palace are thrown open, and* ŒDIPUS *is seen within.*

 

CHORUS  Oh, fearful, piteous sight\!  
Most fearful of all woes  
I hitherto have known\! What madness strange  
Has come on thee, thou wretched one?  
What power with one fell swoop,  
Ills heaping upon ills,  
Each greater than the last,  
Has marked thee for its prey?  
Woe\! woe\! thou doomed one, wishing much to ask,  
And much to learn, and much to gaze into,  
I cannot look on thee,  
So horrible the sight\!

 

ŒDIP.  Ah, woe\! ah, woe\! ah, woe\!  
Woe for my misery\!  
Where am I wand’ring in my utter woe?  
Where floats my voice in air?  
Dread power, where leadest thou?

 

CHORUS  To doom of dread nor sight nor speech may bear.

 

ŒDIP.  O cloud of darkest guilt  
That onwards sweeps with dread ineffable,  
Resistless, borne along by evil blast,  
Woe, woe, and woe again\!  
How through my soul there darts the sting of pain,  
The memory of my crimes.

 

CHORUS  And who can wonder that in such dire woes  
Thou mournest doubly, bearing twofold ills?

 

ŒDIP.  Ah, friend,  
Thou only keepest by me, faithful found,  
Nor dost the blind one slight.  
Woe, woe,  
For thou escap’st me not, I know thee well;  
Though all is dark, I still can hear thy voice.

 

CHORUS  O man of fearful deeds, how couldst thou bear  
Thine eyes to outrage? What power stirred thee to it?

 

ŒDIP.  Apollo\! oh, my friends, the God, Apollo\!  
Who worketh all my woes — yes, all my woes.  
No human hand but mine has done this deed.  
What need for me to see,  
When nothing’s left that’s sweet to look upon?

 

CHORUS  Too truly dost thou speak the thing that is.

 

ŒDIP.  Yea, what remains to see,  
Or what to love, or hear,  
With any touch of joy?  
Lead me away, my friends, with utmost speed,  
Lead me away, the foul polluted one,  
Of all men most accursed,  
Most hateful to the Gods.

 

CHORUS  Ah, wretched one, alike in soul and doom,  
Would that my eyes had never known thy face\!

 

ŒDIP.  Ill fate be his who loosed the fetters sharp,  
That ate into my flesh,  
And freed me from the doom of death,  
And saved me — thankless boon\!  
Ah\! had I died but then,  
Nor to my friends nor me had been such woe.

 

CHORUS  That I, too, vainly wish\!

 

ŒDIP.  Yes; then I had not been  
My father’s murderer:  
Nor had men pointed to me as the man  
Wedded with her who bore him.  
But now all god-deserted, born in sins,  
In incest joined with her who gave me birth;  
Yea, if there be an evil worse than all,  
It falls on Œdipus\!

 

CHORUS  I may not call thy acts or counsels good,  
For better wert thou dead than living blind.

 

ŒDIP.  Persuade me not, nor counsel give to show  
That what I did was not the best to do.  
I know not how, on entering Hades dark,  
To look for my own father or my mother,  
Crimes worse than deadly done against them both.  
And though my children’s face was sweet to see  
With their growth growing, yet these eyes no more  
That sight shall see, nor citadel, nor tower,  
Nor sacred shrines of Gods whence I, who stood  
Most honoured one in Thebes, myself have banished,  
Commanding all to thrust the godless forth,  
Him whom the Gods do show accursed, the stock  
Of Laius old. And could I dare to look,  
Such dire pollution fixing on myself,  
And meet them face to face? Not so, not so.  
Yea, if I could but stop the stream of sound,  
And dam mine ears against it, I would do it,  
Closing each wretched sense that I might live  
Both blind, and hearing nothing, Sweet ’twould be  
To keep the soul beyond the reach of ills.  
Why, O Kithæron, didst thou shelter me,  
Nor kill me out of hand? I had not shown,  
In that case, all men whence I drew my birth.

 

O Polybus, and Corinth, and the home  
I thought was mine, how strange a growth ye reared,  
All fair outside, all rotten at the core;  
For vile I stand, descended from the vile.  
Ye threefold roads and thickets half concealed,  
The hedge, the narrow pass where three ways meet,  
Which at my hands did drink my father’s blood,  
Remember ye what deeds I did in you;  
What, hither come, I did? — the marriage rites  
That gave me birth, and then, commingling all,  
In horrible confusion, showed in one  
A father, brother, son, all kindreds mixed,  
Mother, and wife, and daughter, hateful names,  
All foulest deeds that men have ever done.  
But, since, where deeds are evil, speech is wrong,  
With utmost speed, by all the Gods, or hide,  
Or take my life, or cast me in the sea,  
Where nevermore your eyes may look on me.  
Come, scorn ye not to touch my misery,  
But hearken; fear ye not; no soul but I  
Can bear the burden of my countless ills.

 

CHORUS  The man for what thou need’st is come in time,  
Creon, to counsel and to act, for now  
He in thy place is left our only guide.

 

ŒDIP.  Ah, me\! what language shall I hold to him,  
What trust at his hands claim? In all the past  
I showed myself to him most vile and base.  
*Enter* CREON

 

CREON.  I have not come, O Œdipus, to scorn,  
Nor to reproach thee for thy former crimes;  
But ye, if ye have lost your sense of shame  
For mortal men, yet reverence the light  
Of him, our King, the Sun-God, source of life,  
Nor sight so foul expose unveiled to view,  
Which neither earth, nor shower from heaven nor light,  
Can see and welcome. But with utmost speed  
Convey him in; for nearest kin alone  
Can meetly see and hear their kindred’s ills.

 

ŒDIP.  Oh, by the Gods\! since thou, beyond my hopes,  
Dost come all noble unto me all base,  
In one thing hearken. For thy good I ask.

 

CREON.  And what request seek’st thou so wistfully?

 

ŒDIP.  Cast me with all thy speed from out this land,  
Where nevermore a man may look on me\!

 

CREON.  Be sure I would have done so, but I wished  
To learn what now the God will bid us do.

 

ŒDIP.  The oracle was surely clear enough  
That I, the parricide, the pest, should die.

 

CREON.  So ran the words. But in our present need  
’Tis better to learn surely what to do.

 

ŒDIP.  And will ye ask for one so vile as I?

 

CREON.  Yea, now thou, too, wouldst trust the voice of God.

 

ŒDIP.  And this I charge thee, yea, and supplicate,  
For her within, provide what tomb thou wilt,  
For for thine own most meetly thou wilt care;  
But never let this city of my fathers  
Be sentenced to receive me as its guest;  
But suffer me on yon lone hills to dwell,  
Where stands Kithæron, chosen as my tomb  
While still I lived, by mother and by sire,  
That I may die by those who sought to kill.  
And yet this much I know, that no disease,  
Nor aught else could have killed me; ne’er from death  
Had I been saved but for this destined doom.  
But for our fate, whatever comes may come:  
And for my boys, O Creon, lay no charge  
Of them upon me. They are grown, nor need,  
Where’er they be, feel lack of means to live.  
But for my two poor girls, all desolate,  
To whom their table never brought a meal  
Without my presence, but whate’er I touched  
They still partook of with me; these I care for.  
Yea, let me touch them with my hands, and weep  
To them my sorrows. Grant it, O my prince,  
O born of noble nature\!  
Could I but touch them with my hands, I feel  
Still I should have them mine, as when I saw.  
*Enter* ANTIGONE and ISMENE

 

What say I? What is this?  
Do I not hear, ye Gods, their dear, loved tones,  
Broken with sobs, and Creon, pitying me,  
Hath sent the dearest of my children to me?  
Is it not so?

 

CREON.  It is so. I am he who gives thee this,  
Knowing the joy thou hadst in them of old.

 

ŒDIP.  Good luck have thou\! And may the powers on high  
Guard thy path better than they guarded mine\!  
Where are ye, O my children? Come, oh, come  
To these your brother’s hands, which but now tore  
Your father’s eyes, that once were bright to see,  
Who, O my children, blind and knowing naught,  
Became your father — how, I may not tell.  
I weep for you, though sight is mine no more,  
Picturing in mind the sad and dreary life  
Which waits you in the world in years to come;  
For to what friendly gatherings will ye go,  
Or festive joys, from whence, for stately show  
Once yours, ye shall not home return in tears?  
And when ye come to marriageable age,  
Who is there, O my children, rash enough  
To make his own the shame that then will fall  
On those who bore me, and on you as well?  
What evil fails us here? Your father killed  
His father, and was wed in incest foul  
With her who bore him, and ye owe your birth  
To her who gave him his. Such shame as this  
Will men lay on you, and who then will dare  
To make you his in marriage? None, not one,  
My children\! but ye needs must waste away,  
Unwedded, childless, Thou, Menœkeus’ son,  
Since thou alone art left a father to them  
\(For we, their parents, perish utterly\),  
Suffer them not to wander husbandless,  
Nor let thy kindred beg their daily bread;  
But look on them with pity, seeing them  
At their age, but for thee, deprived of all.  
O noble soul, I pray thee, touch my hand  
In token of consent. And ye, my girls,  
Had ye the minds to hearken I would fain  
Give ye much counsel. As it is, pray for me  
To live where’er is meet; and for yourselves  
A brighter life than his ye call your sire.

 

CREON.  Enough of tears and words. Go thou within.

 

ŒDIP.  I needs must yield, however, hard it be.

 

CREON.  In their right season all things prospect best.

 

ŒDIP.  Know’st thou my wish?

 

CREON.  Speak and I then shall hear.

 

ŒDIP.  That thou shouldst send me far away from home.

 

CREON.  Thou askest what the Gods alone can give.

 

ŒDIP.  And yet I go most hated of the Gods.

 

CREON.  And therefore it may chance thou gain’st thy wish.

 

ŒDIP.  And dost thou promise, then, to grant it me?

 

CREON.  I am not wont to utter idle words.

 

ŒDIP.  Lead me, then, hence.

 

CREON.  Go thou, but leave the girls.

 

ŒDIP.  Ah, take them not from me\!

 

CREON.  Thou must not think  
To have thy way in all things all thy life.  
Thou hadst it once, yet went it ill with thee.

 

CHORUS  Ye men of Thebes, behold this Œdipus,  
Who knew the famous riddle and was noblest,  
Who envied no one’s fortune and success.  
And, lo,\! in what a sea of direst woe  
He now is plunged. From hence the lesson draw,  
To reckon no man happy till ye see  
The closing day; until he pass the bourn  
Which severs life from death, unscathed by woe.

*E**NTER* ANTIGONE *AND* ISMENE

 

ANTIGONE  ISMENE, mine own sister, dearest one;  
Is there, of all the ills of Œdipus,  
One left that Zeus will fail to bring on us,  
While still we live? for nothing is there sad  
Or full of woe, or base, or fraught with shame,  
But I have seen it in thy woes and mine.  
And now, what new decree is this they tell,  
Our ruler has enjoined on all the state?  
Know’st thou? hast heard? or is it hid from thee,  
The doom of foes that comes upon thy friends?

 

ISM.  No tidings of our friends, Antigone,  
Painful or pleasant since that hour have come  
When we, two sisters, lost our brothers twain,  
In one day dying by each other’s hand.  
And since in this last night the Argive host  
Has left the field, I nothing further know,  
Nor brightening fortune, nor increasing gloom.

 

ANTIG.  That knew I well, and therefore sent for thee  
Beyond the gates, that thou mayst hear alone.

 

ISM.  What meanest thou? It is but all too clear  
Thou broodest darkly o’er some tale of woe.

 

ANTIG.  And does not Creon treat our brothers twain  
One with the rites of burial, one with shame?  
Eteocles, so say they, he interred  
Fitly, with wonted rites, as one held meet  
To pass with honour to the gloom below.  
But for the corpse of Polynices, slain  
So piteously, they say, he has proclaimed  
To all the citizens, that none should give  
His body burial, or bewail his fate,  
But leave it still unsepulchred, unwept,  
A prize full rich for birds that scent afar  
Their sweet repast. So Creon bids, they say,  
Creon the good, commanding thee and me,  
Yes, me, I say, and now is coming here,  
To make it clear to those who knew it not,  
And counts the matter not a trivial thing;  
But whoso does the things that he forbids,  
For him, there waits within the city’s walls  
The death of stoning. Thus, then, stands thy case;  
And quickly thou wilt show, if thou art born  
Of noble nature, or degenerate liv’st,  
Base child of honoured parents.

 

ISM.  How could I,  
O daring in thy mood, in this our plight,  
Or doing or undoing, aught avail?

 

ANTIG.  Wilt thou with me share risk and toil? Look to it.

 

ISM.  What risk is this? What purpose fills thy mind?

 

ANTIG.  Wilt thou with me go forth to help the dead?

 

ISM.  And dost thou mean to give him sepulture,  
When all have been forbidden?

 

ANTIG.  He is still  
My brother; yes, and thine, though thou, it seems,  
Wouldst fain he were not. I desert him not.

 

ISM.  O daring one, when Creon bids thee not\!

 

ANTIG.  What right has he to keep me from mine own?

 

ISM.  Ah me\! remember, sister, how our sire  
Perished, with hate o’erwhelmed and infamy,  
From evils that he brought upon himself,  
And with his own hand robbed himself of sight,  
And how his wife and mother, both in one,  
With twist and cordage, cast away her life;  
And thirdly, how our brothers in one day  
In suicidal conflict wrought the doom,  
Each of the other. And we twain are left;  
And think, how much more wretchedly than all  
We twain shall perish, if, against the law,  
We brave our sovereign’s edict and his power.  
For this we need remember, we were born  
Women; as such, not made to strive with men.  
And next, that they who reign surpass in strength,  
And we must bow to this, and worse than this.  
I, then, entreating those that dwell below,  
To judge me leniently, as forced to yield,  
Will hearken to our rulers. Over-zeal  
In act or word but little wisdom shows.

 

ANTIG.  I would not ask thee. No\! if thou shouldst wish  
To do it, and wouldst gladly join with me.  
Do what thou wilt, I go to bury him;  
And good it were, this having done, to die.  
Loved I shall be with him whom I have loved,  
Guilty of holiest crime. More time have I  
In which to win the favour of the dead,  
Than that of those who live; for I shall rest  
For ever there. But thou, if thus thou please,  
Count as dishonoured what the Gods approve.

 

ISM.  I do them no dishonour, but I find  
Myself too weak to war against the state.

 

ANTIG.  Make what excuse thou wilt, I go to rear  
A grave above the brother whom I love.

 

ISM.  Ah, wretched me\! how much I fear for thee.

 

ANTIG.  Fear not for me. Thine own fate guide aright.

 

ISM.  At any rate, disclose this deed to none:  
Keep it close hidden. I will hide it too.

 

ANTIG.  Speak out\! I bid thee. Silent, thou wilt be  
More hateful to me than if thou shouldst tell  
My deed to all men.

 

ISM.  Fiery is thy mood,  
Although thy deeds might chill the very blood.

 

ANTIG.  I know I please the souls I seek to please.

 

ISM.  If thou canst do it; but thy passion craves  
For things impossible.

 

ANTIG.  I’ll cease to strive  
When strength shall fail me.

 

ISM.  Even from the first,  
It is not meet to seek what may not be.

 

ANTIG.  If thou speak thus, my hatred wilt thou gain,  
And rightly wilt be hated of the dead.  
Leave me and my ill counsel to endure  
This dreadful doom. I shall not suffer aught  
So evil as a death dishonourable.

 

ISM.  Go, then, if so thou wilt. Of this be sure,  
Wild as thou art, thy friends must love thee still.  \[*Exeunt.*  
*Enter* Chorus

 

STROPH. I

 

*Chor.*  Ray of the glorious sun,  
Brightest of all that ever shone on Thebes,  
Thebes with her seven high gates,  
Thou didst appear that day,  
Eye of the golden dawn,  
O’er Dirkè’s streams advancing,  
Driving with quickened curb,  
In haste of headlong flight,  
The warrior who, in panoply of proof,  
From Argos came, with shield as white as snow;  
Who came to this our land,  
Roused by the strife of tongues  
That Polynices stirred;  
Shrieking his shrill sharp cry,  
The eagle hovered round,  
With snow-white wing bedecked,  
Begirt with myriad arms,  
And flowing horsehair crests.

 

ANTISTROPH. I  
He stood above our towers,  
Circling, with blood-stained spears,  
The portals of our gates;  
He went, before he filled  
His jaws with blood of men,  
Before Hephæstus with his pitchy flame  
Had seized our crown of towers.  
So loud the battle din that Ares loves,  
Was raised around his rear,  
A conflict hard and stiff,  
E’en for his dragon foe.  
For breath of haughty speech  
Zeus hateth evermore exceedingly;  
And seeing them advance,  
Exulting in the clang of golden arms,  
With brandished fire he hurls them headlong down,  
In act, upon the topmost battlement  
Rushing, with eager step,  
To shout out, ‘Victory\!’

 

STROPH. II  
Crashing to earth he fell,  
Who came, with madman’s haste,  
Drunken, but not with wine,  
And swept o’er us with blasts,  
The whirlwind blasts of hate.  
Thus on one side they fare,  
And mighty Ares, bounding in his strength,  
Dashing now here, now there,  
Elsewhere brought other fate.  
For seven chief warriors at the seven gates met,  
Equals with equals matched,  
To Zeus, the Lord of War,  
Left tribute, arms of bronze;  
All but the hateful ones  
Who, from one father and one mother sprung,  
Stood wielding, hand to hand,  
Their doubly pointed spears;  
They had their doom of death,  
In common, shared by both.

 

ANTISTROPH. II  
But now, since Victory, of mightiest name,  
Hath come to Thebes, of many chariots proud,  
Joying and giving joy,  
After these wars just past,  
Learn ye forgetfulness,  
And all night long, with dance and voice of hymns  
Let us go round to all the shrines of Gods,  
While Bacchus, making Thebes resound with shouts,  
Begins the strain of joy;  
But, lo\! the sovereign of this land of ours,

 

*CREON*, Menœkeus’ son,  
He, whom strange change and chances from the God  
Have nobly raised to power,  
Comes to us, steering on some new device;  
For, lo\! he hath convened,  
By herald’s loud command,  
This council of the elders of our land.  
*Enter* CREON

 

CREON.  My Friends, for what concerns our commonwealth,  
The Gods who vexed it with the billowing storms  
Have righted it again; but I have sent,  
By special summons, calling you to come  
Apart from all the others, This, in part,  
As knowing ye did all along uphold  
The might of Laius’ throne, in part again,  
Because when Œdipus our country ruled,  
And, when he perished, then towards his sons  
Ye still were faithful in your steadfast mind.  
And since they fell, as by a double death,  
Both on the selfsame day with murderous blow,  
Smiting and being smitten, now I hold  
Their thrones and all their power of sov’reignty  
By nearness of my kindred to the dead.  
And hard it is to learn what each man is,  
In heart and mind and judgment, till one gains  
Experience in the exercise of power.  
For me, whoe’er is called to guide a state,  
And does not catch at counsels wise and good,  
But holds his peace through any fear of man,  
I deem him basest of all men that are,  
Of all that ever have been; and whoe’er  
As worthier than his country counts his friend,  
I utterly despise him. I myself,  
Zeus be my witness, who beholdeth all,  
Will not keep silence, seeing danger come,  
Instead of safety, to my subjects true.  
Nor could I take as friend my country’s foe;  
For this I know, that there our safety lies,  
And sailing in her while she holds her course,  
We gather friends around us. By these rules  
And such as these will I maintain the state.  
And now I come, with edicts close allied  
To these in spirit, for my subjects all,  
Concerning those two sons of Œdipus.  
Eteocles, who died in deeds of might  
Illustrious, fighting for our fatherland,  
To honour him with sepulture, all rites  
Duly performed that to the noblest dead  
Of right belong. Not so his brother; him  
I speak of, Polynices, who, returned  
From exile, sought with fire and sword to waste  
His father’s city and the shrines of Gods,  
Yea, sought to glut his rage with blood of men,  
And lead them captives to the bondslave’s doom;  
Him I decree that none should dare entomb,  
That none should utter wail or loud lament,  
But leave his corpse unburied, by the dogs  
And vultures mangled, foul to look upon.  
Such is my purpose. Ne’er, if I can help,  
Shall the vile share the honours of the just;  
But whoso shows himself my country’s friend,  
Living or dead, from me shall honour gain.

 

*Chor.*  This is thy pleasure, O Menœkeus’ son,  
For him who hated, him who loved our state;  
And thou hast power to make what laws thou wilt,  
Both for the dead and all of us who live.

 

CREON.  Be ye, then, guardians of the things I speak.

 

*Chor.*  Commit this task to one of younger years.

 

CREON.  The watchmen are appointed for the corpse.

 

*Chor.*  What duty, then, enjoin’st thou on another?

 

CREON.  Not to consent with those that disobey.

 

*Chor.*  None are so foolish as to seek for death.

 

CREON.  And that shall be his doom; but love of gain  
Hath oft with false hopes lured men to their death.  
*Enter* Guard

 

GUARD.  I will not say, O king, that I am come  
Panting with speed and plying nimble feet,  
For I had many halting-points of thought,  
Backwards and forwards turning, round and round;  
For now my mind would give me sage advice:  
“Poor wretch, and wilt thou go and bear the blame?”  
Or— “Dost thou tarry now? Shall Creon know  
These things from others? How wilt thou escape?”  
Resolving thus, I came in haste, yet slow,  
And thus a short way finds itself prolonged,  
But, last of all, to come to thee prevailed.  
And though I tell of naught, thou shalt hear all;  
For this one hope I cling to steadfastly,  
That I shall suffer nothing but my fate.

 

CREON.  What is it, then, that causes such dismay?

 

GUARD.  First, for mine own share in it, this I say,  
I did not do it, do not know who did,  
Nor should I rightly come to ill for it.

 

CREON.  Thou tak’st good aim and fencest up thy tale  
All round and round. ’Twould seem thou hast some news.

 

GUARD.  Yea, news of fear engenders long delay.

 

CREON.  Tell thou thy tale, and then depart in peace.

 

GUARD.  And speak I will. The corpse … Some one has been  
But now and buried it, a little dust  
O’er the skin scattering, with the wonted rites.

 

CREON.  What say’st thou? Who has dared this deed of guilt?

 

GUARD.  I know not. Neither was there stroke of spade,  
Nor earth cast up by mattock. All the soil  
Was dry and hard, no track of chariot wheel;  
But he who did it went and left no sign.  
But when the first day’s watchman showed it us,  
The sight caused wonder and sore grief to all,  
For he had disappeared. No tomb, indeed,  
Was over him, but dust all lightly strown,  
As by some hand that shunned defiling guilt;  
And no work was there of a beast of prey  
Or dog devouring. Evil words arose  
Among us, guard to guard imputing blame,  
Which might have come to blows, for none was there  
To check its course, and each to each appeared  
The man whose hand had done it. As for proof,  
That there was none, and so he ‘scaped our ken.  
And we were ready in our hands to take  
Bars of hot iron, and to walk through fire,  
And call the Gods to witness none of us  
Had done the deed, nor knew who counselled it,  
Nor who had wrought it. Then at last, when naught  
Was gained by all our searching, some one says  
What made us bend our gaze upon the ground  
In fear and trembling; for we neither saw  
How to oppose it, nor, accepting it,  
How we might prosper in it. And his speech  
Was this, that all our tale should go to thee,  
Not hushed up anywise. This gained the day;  
And me, ill-starred, the lot condemns to win  
This precious prize. So here I come to thee  
Against my will; and surely do I trow  
Thou dost not wish to see me. Still ’tis true  
That no man loves the messenger of ill.

 

*Chor.*  For me, my prince, my mind some time has thought  
That this perchance has some divine intent.

 

CREON.  Cease thou, before thou fillest me with wrath,  
Lest thou be found a dastard and a fool.  
For what thou say’st is most intolerable,  
That for this corpse the providence of Gods  
Has any care. What\! have they buried him,  
As to their patron paying honours high,  
Who came to waste their columned shrines with fire,  
To desecrate their offerings and their lands,  
And all their wonted customs? Dost thou see  
The Gods approving men of evil deeds?  
It is not so; but men of rebel mood,  
Lifting their head in secret long ago,  
Have stirred this thing against me. Never yet  
Had they their neck beneath the yoke, content  
To own me as their ruler. They, I know,  
Have bribed these men to let the deed be done.  
No thing in use by man, for power of ill,  
Can equal money. This lays cities low,  
This drives men forth from quiet dwelling-place,  
This warps and changes minds of worthiest stamp,  
To turn to deeds of baseness, teaching men  
All shifts of cunning, and to know the guilt  
Of every impious deed. But they who, hired,  
Have wrought this crime, have laboured to their cost,  
Or soon or late to pay the penalty.  
But if Zeus still claims any awe from me,  
Know this, and with an oath I tell it thee,  
Unless ye find the very man whose hand  
Has wrought this burial, and before mine eyes  
Present him captive, death shall not suffice,  
Till first, impaled still living, ye shall show  
The story of this outrage, that henceforth,  
Knowing what gain is lawful, ye may grasp  
At that, and learn it is not meet to love  
Gain from all quarters. By base profit won,  
You will see more destroyed than prospering.

 

GUARD.  May I, then speak? Or shall I turn and go?

 

CREON.  Dost thou not see how vexing are thy words?

 

GUARD.  Is it thine ears they trouble, or thy soul?

 

CREON.  Why dost thou gauge my trouble where it is?

 

GUARD.  The doer grieves thy heart, but I thine ears.

 

CREON.  Pshaw\! what a babbler, born to prate, art thou.

 

GUARD.  And therefore not the man to do this deed.

 

CREON.  Yes, that too; selling e’en thy soul for pay.

 

GUARD.  Ah me\!  
How fearful ’tis, in thinking, false to think.

 

CREON.  Prate about thinking; but unless ye show  
To me the doers, ye shall say ere long  
That evil gains still work their punishment.  \[*Exit.*

 

GUARD.  God send we find him\! Should we find him not,  
As well may be, for this must chance decide,  
You will not see me coming here again;  
For now, being safe beyond all hope of mine,  
Beyond all thought, I owe the Gods much thanks.  \[*Exit.*

 

STROPH. I

 

*Chor.*  Many the forms of life,  
Fearful and strange to see,  
But man supreme stands out,  
For strangeness and for fear.  
He, with the wintry gales,  
O’er the foam-crested sea,  
‘Mid billows surging round,  
Tracketh his way across:  
Earth, of all Gods, from ancient days, the first,  
Mightiest and undecayed,  
He, with his circling plough,  
Wears ever year by year.

 

ANTISTROPH. I  
The thoughtless tribe of birds,  
The beasts that roam the fields,  
The finny brood of ocean’s depths,  
He takes them all in nets of knotted mesh,  
Man, wonderful in skill.  
And by his arts he holds in sway  
The wild beasts on the mountain’s height;  
And brings the neck-encircling yoke  
On horse with shaggy mane,  
Or bull that walks untamed upon the hills.

 

STROPH. II  
And speech, and thought as swift as wind,  
And tempered mood for higher life of states,  
These he has learnt, and how to flee  
The stormy sleet of frost unkind,  
The tempest thunderbolts of Zeus.  
So all-preparing, unprepared  
He meeteth naught the coming days may bring;  
Only from Hades, still  
He fails to find a refuge at the last,  
Though skill of art may teach him to escape  
From depths of fell disease incurable.

 

ANTISTROPH. II  
So, gifted with a wondrous might,  
Above all fancy’s dreams, with skill to plan,  
Now unto evil, now to good,  
He wends his way. Now holding fast the laws,  
His country’s sacred rights,  
That rest upon the oath of Gods on high,  
High in the state he stands.  
An outlaw and an exile he who loves  
The thing that is not good,  
In wilful pride of soul:  
Ne’er may he sit beside my hearth,  
Ne’er may my thoughts be like to his,  
Who worketh deeds like this.  
*Enter* Guards, *bringing in* ANTIGONE  
As to this portent which the Gods have sent,  
I stand in doubt. Can I, who know her, say  
That this is not the maid Antigone?  
O wretched one of wretched father born,  
What means this? Surely ’tis not that they bring  
Thee as a rebel ‘gainst the king’s decree,  
And taken in the folly of thine act?

 

GUARD.  Yes\! She it was by whom the deed was done.  
We found her burying. Where is Creon, pray?

 

*Chor.*  Forth from his palace comes he just in time.  
*Enter* CREON

 

CREON.  What chance is this with which my coming fits?

 

GUARD.  Men, O my king, should pledge themselves to naught;  
For cool reflection makes their purpose void.  
I hardly thought to venture here again,  
Cowed by thy threats, which then fell thick on me;  
But since no joy is like the sweet delight  
Which comes beyond, above, against our hopes,  
I come, although I swore the contrary,  
Bringing this maiden, whom in act we found  
Decking the grave. No need for lots was now;  
The prize was mine, no other claimed a share.  
And now, O king, take her, and as thou wilt,  
Judge and convict her. I can claim a right  
To wash my hands of all this troublous coil.

 

CREON.  How and where was it that ye seized and brought her?

 

GUARD.  She was in act of burying. Now thou knowest  
All that I have to tell.

 

CREON.  And dost thou know  
And rightly weigh the tale thou tellest me?

 

GUARD.  I saw her burying that selfsame corpse  
Thou bad’st us not to bury. Speak I clear?

 

CREON.  How was she seen, detected, prisoner made?

 

GUARD.  The matter passed as follows: When we came,  
With all those dreadful threats of thine upon us,  
Sweeping away the dust which, lightly spread,  
Covered the corpse, and laying stript and bare  
The tained carcase, on the hill we sat  
To windward, shunning the infected air,  
Each stirring up his fellow with strong words,  
If any shirked his duty. This went on  
Some time, until the glowing orb of day  
Stood in mid-heaven, and the scorching heat  
Fell on us. Then a sudden whirlwind rose,  
A scourge from heaven, raising squalls on earth,  
And filled the plain, the leafage stripping bare  
Of all the forest, and the air’s vast space  
Was thick and troubled, and we closed our eyes  
Until the plague the Gods had sent was past;  
And when it ceased, a weary time being gone,  
The girl was seen, and with a bitter cry,  
Shrill as a bird’s, she wails, when it beholds  
Its nest all emptied of its infant brood;  
So she, when she beholds the corpse all stript,  
Groaned loud with many moanings. And she called  
Fierce curses down on those who did the deed,  
And in her hand she brings some sandlike dust,  
And from a well-chased ewer, all of bronze,  
She pours the three libations o’er the dead.  
And we, beholding, started up forthwith,  
And run her down, in nothing terrified.  
And then we charged her with the former deed,  
As well as this. And nothing she denied.  
But this to me both bitter is and sweet,  
For to escape one’s-self from ill is sweet,  
But to bring friends to trouble, this is hard  
And bitter. Yet my nature bids me count  
Above all these things safety for myself.

 

CREON.  \[*to* ANTIGONE\] And thou, then, bending to the ground thy head,  
Confessest thou, or dost deny the deed?

 

ANTIG.  I own I did it. I will not deny.

 

CREON.  \[*to* GUARD\] Go thou thy way, where’er thy will may choose,  
Freed from a weighty charge.  \[*Exit* GUARD.  
\[*To* ANTIGONE\] And now for thee,  
Say in few words, not lengthening out thy speech,  
Didst thou not know the edicts which forbade  
The things thou ownest?

 

ANTIG.  Right well I knew them all.  
How could I not? Full clear and plain were they.

 

CREON.  Didst thou, then, dare to disobey these laws?

 

ANTIG.  Yes, for it was not Zeus who gave them forth,  
Nor Justice, dwelling with the Gods below,  
Who traced these laws for all the sons of men;  
Nor did I deem thy edicts strong enough,  
Coming from mortal man, to set at naught  
The unwritten laws of God that know not change.  
They are not of to-day nor yesterday,  
But live for ever, nor can man assign  
When first they sprang to being. Not through fear  
Of any man’s resolve was I prepared  
Before the Gods to bear the penalty  
Of sinning against these. That I should die  
I knew \(how should I not?\), though thy decree  
Had never spoken. And, before my time  
If I should die, I reckon this a gain;  
For whoso lives, as I, in many woes,  
How can it be but death shall bring him gain?  
And so for me to bear this doom of thine  
Has nothing painful. But, if I had left  
My mother’s son unburied on his death,  
I should have given them pain. But as things are,  
Pain I feel none. And should I seem to thee  
To have done a foolish deed, ’tis simply this, —   
I bear the charge of folly from a fool.

 

*Chor.*  The maiden’s stubborn will, of stubborn sire  
The offspring shows itself. She knows not yet  
To yield to evils.

 

CREON.  Know, then, minds too stiff  
Most often stumble, and the rigid steel  
Baked in the furnace, made exceeding hard,  
Thou seest most often split and broken lie;  
And I have known the steeds of fiery mood  
With a small curb subdued. It is not meet  
That one who lives in bondage to his neighbours  
Should boast too loudly. Wanton outrage then  
She learnt when first these laws of mine she crossed,  
But, having done it, this is yet again  
A second outrage over it to boast,  
And laugh at having done it. Surely, then,  
She is the man, not I, if all unscathed  
Such deeds of might are hers. But be she child  
Of mine own sister, nearest kin of all  
That Zeus o’erlooks within our palace court,  
She and her sister shall not ‘scape their doom  
Most foul and shameful; for I charge her, too,  
With having planned this deed of sepulture.  
Go ye and call her. ’Twas but now within  
I saw her raving, losing self-command.  
And still the mind of those who in the dark  
Plan deeds of evil is the first to fail,  
And so convicts itself of secret guilt.  
But most I hate when one found out in guilt  
Will seek to glaze and brave it to the end.

 

ANTIG.  And dost thou seek aught else beyond my death?

 

CREON.  Naught else for me. That gaining, I gain all.

 

ANTIG.  Wilt thou delay? Of all thy words not one  
Pleases me now, nor aye is like to please,  
And so all mine must grate upon thine ears.  
And yet how could I higher glory gain  
Than giving my true brother all the rites  
Of solemn burial? These who hear would say  
It pleases them, did not their fear of thee  
Close up their lips. This power has sovereignty,  
That it can do and say whate’er it will.

 

CREON.  Of all the race of Cadmus thou alone  
Look’st thus upon the deed.

 

ANTIG.  They see it too  
As I do, but in fear of thee they keep  
Their tongue between their teeth.

 

CREON.  And dost thou feel  
No shame to plan thy schemes apart from these?

 

ANTIG.  There is no baseness in the act which shows  
Our reverence for our kindred.

 

CREON.  Was he not  
Thy brother also, who against him fought?

 

ANTIG.  He was my brother, of one mother born,  
And of the selfsame father.

 

CREON.  Why, then, pay  
Thine impious honours to the carcase there?

 

ANTIG.  The dead below will not accept thy words.

 

CREON.  Yes, if thou equal honours pay to him,  
And that most impious monster.

 

ANTIG.  ’Twas no slave  
That perished, but my brother.

 

CREON.  Yes, in act  
To waste this land, while *he* in its defence  
Stood fighting bravely.

 

ANTIG.  Not the less does death  
Crave equal rites for all.

 

CREON.  But not that good  
And evil share alike?

 

ANTIG.  And yet who knows  
If in that world these things are counted good?

 

CREON.  Our foe, I tell thee, ne’er becomes our friend,  
Not even when he dies.

 

ANTIG.  My bent is fixed,  
I tell thee, not for hatred, but for love.

 

CREON.  Go, then, below. And if thou must have love,  
Love those thou find’st there. While I live, at least,  
A woman shall not rule.  
*Enter* ISMENE

 

*Chor.*  And, lo\! Ismene at the gate  
Comes shedding tears of sisterly regard,  
And o’er her brow a gathering cloud  
Mars the deep roseate blush,  
Bedewing her fair cheek.

 

CREON.  \[*to* ISMENE\]. And thou who, creeping as a viper creeps,  
Didst drain my life in secret, and I knew not  
That I was rearing two accursèd ones,  
Subverters of my throne: come, tell me, then,  
Dost thou confess thou took’st thy part in it?  
Or wilt thou swear thou didst not know of it?

 

ISM.  I did the deed. Since she will have it so,  
I share the guilt; I bear an equal blame.

 

ANTIG.  This, Justice will not suffer, since, in truth,  
Thou wouldst have none of it. And I, for one,  
Shared it not with thee.

 

ISM.  I am not ashamed  
To count myself companion in thy woes.

 

ANTIG.  Whose was the deed, Death knows, and those below.  
I do not love a friend who loves in words.

 

ISM.  Do not, my sister, put me to such shame  
As not to let me share thy death with thee,  
And with thee pay due reverence to the dead.

 

ANTIG.  Share not my death, nor make thine own this deed  
Thou hadst no hand in. Let my death suffice.

 

ISM.  And what to me is life, bereaved of thee?

 

ANTIG.  Ask Creon there. To him thy tender care  
Is given so largely.

 

ISM.  Why wilt thou torture me,  
In nothing bettered by it?

 

ANTIG.  Yes — at thee,  
E’en while I laugh, I laugh with pain of heart.

 

ISM.  But now, at least, how may I profit thee?

 

ANTIG.  Save thou thyself. I grudge not thy escape.

 

ISM.  Ah, woe is me\! and must I miss thy fate?

 

ANTIG.  Thou mad’st thy choice to live, and I to die.

 

ISM.  ’Tis not through want of any words of mine.

 

ANTIG.  To these thou seemest, doubtless, to be wise;  
I to those others.

 

ISM.  Yet our fault is one.

 

ANTIG.  Take courage. Thou wilt live. My soul long since  
Has given itself to Death, that to the dead  
I might bring help.

 

CREON.  Of these two maidens here,  
The one, I say, hath lost her mind but now,  
The other ever since her life began.

 

ISM.  Yea, O my king. No mind that ever lived  
Stands firm in evil days, but still it goes,  
Beside itself, astray.

 

CREON.  So then did thine  
When thou didst choose thy evil deeds to do,  
With those already evil.

 

ISM.  How could I.  
Alone, apart from her, endure to live?

 

CREON.  Speak not of her. She stands no longer here.

 

ISM.  And wilt thou slay thy son’s betrothed bride?

 

CREON.  Full many a field there is which he may plough.

 

ISM.  But none like that prepared for him and her.

 

CREON.  Wives that are vile, I love not for my son.

 

ANTIG.  Ah, dearest Hæmon, how thy father shames thee\!

 

CREON.  Thou art too vexing, thou, and these thy words,  
On marriage ever harping.

 

ISM.  Wilt thou rob  
Thine own dear son of her whom he has loved?

 

CREON.  ’Tis Death who breaks the marriage contract off.

 

ISM.  Her doom is fixed, it seems, then. She must die.

 

CREON.  So thou dost think, and I. No more delay,  
Ye slaves. Our women henceforth must be kept  
As women — suffered not to roam abroad;  
For even boldest natures shrink in fear  
When they behold the end of life draw nigh.  \[*Exeunt Guards with* ANTIGONE *and* ISMENE.

 

STROPHE. I

 

*Chor.*  Blessed are those whose life has known no woe\!  
For unto those whose house  
The Gods have shaken, nothing fails of curse  
Or woe, that creepeth on,  
To generations, far,  
As when a wave, where Thracian blasts blow strong  
On that tempestuous shore,  
Up surges from the depths beneath the sea,  
And from the deep abyss  
Rolls the black wind-vexed sand,  
And every jutting peak that drives it back  
Re-echoes with the roar.

 

ANTISTROPHE. I  
I see the ancient doom  
That fell upon the seed of Labdacus,  
Who perished long ago,  
Still falling, woes on woes;  
That generation cannot rescue this;  
Some God still urges on,  
And will not be appeased.  
So now there rose a gleam  
Over the last weak shoots  
That sprang from out the race of Œdipus;  
And thus the blood-stained sword  
Of those that reign below  
Cuts off relentlessly  
Madness of speech, and fury of the soul.

 

STROPHE. II  
Thy power, O Zeus, what haughtiness of man  
Could ever hold in check?  
Which neither sleep, that maketh all things old,  
Nor the long months of Gods that wax not faint,  
Can for a moment seize.  
But still as Lord supreme,  
Through time that grows not old,  
Thou dwellest in thy sheen of radiancy  
On far Olympus’ height.  
Through all the future and the coming years,  
As through all time that’s past,  
One law holds ever good,  
That nothing comes to life of man on earth,  
Unscathed throughout by woe.

 

ANTISTROPHE. II  
To many, hope may come, in wanderings wild,  
A solace and a joy;  
To many, shows of fickle-hearted love;  
But still it creepeth on,  
On him who knows it not,  
Until he brings his foot  
Within the scorching flame.  
Wisely from one of old  
The far-famed saying came  
That evil ever seems to be as good  
To those whose thoughts of heart  
God leadeth unto woe,  
And without woe, but shortest time he spends.  
And here comes Hæmon, youngest of thy sons.  
Comes he bewailing sore  
The fate of her who should have been his wife,  
His bride Antigone,  
Sore grieving at the failure of his joys?  
*Enter* HÆMON

 

CREON.  Soon we shall know much more than seers can tell.  
Surely thou dost not come, my son, to rage  
Against thy father, hearing his decree,  
Fixing her doom who should have been thy bride;  
Or are we still, whate’er we do, beloved?

 

HÆMON.  My father, I am thine. Do thou direct  
With thy wise counsels, I will follow them.  
No marriage weighs one moment in the scales  
With me, while thou art prospering in thy reign.

 

CREON.  This thought, my son, should dwell within thy breast,  
That all things stand below a father’s will:  
For this men pray that they may rear and keep  
Obedient offspring by their hearths and homes,  
That they may both requite their father’s foes,  
And pay with him like honours to his friend.  
But he who reareth sons that profit not,  
What could one say of him but this, that he  
Breeds his own sorrow, laughter to his foes?  
Lose not thy reason, then, my son, o’ercome  
By pleasure, for a woman’s sake, but know,  
A cold embrace is that to have at home  
A worthless wife, the partner of thy bed.  
What ulcerous sore is worse than one we love  
Who proves all worthless? No\! with loathing scorn,  
As hateful to thee, let her go and wed  
A spouse in Hades. Taken in the act  
I found her, her alone of all the state,  
Rebellious. And I will not make myself  
False to the state. She dies. So let her call  
On Zeus, the lord of kindred. If I rear  
Of mine own stock things foul and orderless,  
I shall have work enough with those without.  
For he who in the life of home is good  
Will still be seen as just in things of state;  
While he who breaks or goes beyond the laws,  
Or thinks to bid the powers that be obey,  
He must not hope to gather praise from me.  
No\! we must follow whom the state appoints  
In things or just and lowly, or, may be,  
The opposite of these. Of such a man  
I should be sure that he would govern well,  
And know well to be governed, and would stand,  
In war’s wild storm, on his appointed post,  
A just and good defender. Anarchy  
Is our worst evil, brings our commonwealth  
To utter ruin, lays whole houses low,  
In battle strife hurls men in shameful flight;  
But they who walk uprightly, these shall find  
Obedience saves most men. Sure help should come  
To what our rulers order; least of all  
Ought we to bow before a woman’s sway.  
Far better, if it must be so, to fall  
By a man’s hand, than thus to bear reproach,  
By woman conquered.

 

*Chor.*  Unto us, O king,  
Unless our years have robbed us of our wit,  
Thou seemest to say wisely what thou say’st.

 

HÆM.  The Gods, my father, have bestowed on man  
His reason, noblest of all earthly gifts;  
Nor dare I say nor prove that what thou speak’st  
Is aught but right. And yet another’s thoughts  
May have some reason. I am wont to watch  
What each man says or does, or blames in thee  
\(For dread thy face to one of low estate\),  
In words thou wouldst not much rejoice to hear.  
But I can hear the things in darkness said,  
How the whole city wails this maiden’s fate,  
As one “who of all women worthiest praise,  
For noblest deed must die the foulest death.  
She who, her brother fallen in the fray,  
Would neither leave unburied, nor expose  
To carrion dogs, or any bird of prey,  
May she not claim the meed of golden crown?”  
Such is the whisper that in secret runs  
All darkling. And for me, my father, naught  
Is dearer than thy welfare. What can be  
A nobler form of honour for the son  
Than a sire’s glory, or for sire than son’s?  
I pray thee, then, wear not one mood alone,  
That what thou say’st is right, and naught but that;  
For he who thinks that he alone is wise,  
His mind and speech above what others boast,  
Such men when searched are mostly empty found.  
But for a man to learn, though he be wise,  
Yea, to learn much, and know the time to yield,  
Brings no disgrace. When winter floods the streams,  
Thou seest the trees that bend before the storm,  
Save their last twigs, while those that will not yield  
Perish with root and branch. And when one hauls  
Too tight the mainsail sheet, and will not slack,  
He has to end his voyage with deck o’erturned.  
Do thou, then, yield. Permit thyself to change.  
Young though I be, if any prudent thought  
Be with me, I at least will dare assert  
The higher worth of one who, come what will,  
Is full of knowledge. If that may not be  
\(For nature is not wont to take that bent\),  
’Tis good to learn from those who counsel well.

 

*Chor.*  My king\! ’tis fit that thou shouldst learn from him,  
If he speaks words in season; and, in turn,  
That thou \[*to* HÆMON\] shouldst learn of him, for both speak well.

 

CREON.  Shall we at our age stoop to learn from him,  
Such as he is, our lesson?

 

HÆM.  ‘Twere not wrong.  
And if I be but young, not age but deeds  
Thou shouldst regard.

 

CREON.  Fine deeds, I trow, to pay  
Such honour to the lawless.

 

HÆM.  ’Tis not I  
Would bid you waste your honour on the base.

 

CREON.  And has she not been seized with that disease?

 

HÆM.  The men of Thebes with one accord say, No.

 

CREON.  And will my subjects tell me how to rule?

 

HÆM.  Dost thou not see that these words fall from thee  
As from some beardless boy?

 

CREON.  And who, then, else  
But me should rule this land?

 

HÆM.  That is no state  
Which hangs on one man’s will.

 

CREON.  The state, I pray,  
It is not reckoned his who governs it?

 

HÆM.  Brave rule\! Alone, and o’er an empty land\!

 

CREON.  Here, as it seems, is one who still will fight,  
A woman’s friend.

 

HÆM.  If thou a woman be,  
For all my care I lavish upon thee.

 

CREON.  Basest of base, who with thy father still  
Wilt hold debate\!

 

HÆM.  For, lo\! I see thee still  
Guilty of wrong.

 

CREON.  And am I guilty, then,  
Claiming due reverence for my sovereignty?

 

HÆM.  Thou show’st no reverence, trampling on the laws  
The Gods hold sacred.

 

CREON.  O thou sin-stained soul,  
A woman’s victim.

 

HÆM.  Yet thou wilt not find  
In me the slave of baseness.

 

CREON.  All thy speech  
Still hangs on her.

 

HÆM.  Yes, and on thee, myself,  
And the great Gods below.

 

CREON.  Of this be sure,  
Thou shalt not wed her in the land of life.

 

HÆM.  She, then, must die, and in her death will slay  
Another than herself.

 

CREON.  And dost thou dare  
To come thus threatening?

 

HÆM.  Is it then a threat  
To speak to erring judgment?

 

CREON.  To thy cost  
Thou shalt learn wisdom, having none thyself.

 

HÆM.  If thou wert not my father, I would say  
Thou wert not wise.

 

CREON.  Thou woman’s slave, I say,  
Prate on no longer.

 

HÆM.  Dost thou wish to speak,  
And, speaking, wilt not listen? Is it so?

 

CREON.  No, by Olympus\! Thou shalt not go free  
To flout me with reproaches. Lead her out  
Whom my soul hates, that she may die forthwith  
Before mine eyes, and near her bridegroom here.

 

HÆM.  No\! Think it not\! Near me she shall not die,  
And thou shalt never see my face alive,  
So mad art thou with all that would be friends.  \[*Exit.*

 

*Chor.*  The man has gone, O king, in hasty mood.  
A mind distressed in youth is hard to bear.

 

CREON.  Let him do what he will, and bear himself  
Too high for mortal state, he shall not free  
Those maidens from their doom\!

 

*Chor.*  And dost thou mean  
To slay them both?

 

CREON.  Not her who touched it not.

 

*Chor.*  There thou say’st well: and with what kind of death  
Mean’st thou to kill her?

 

CREON.  Where the desert path  
Is loneliest, there, alive, in rocky cave  
Will I immure her, just so much of food  
Before her set as may appease the Gods,  
And save the city from the guilt of blood;  
And there, invoking Hades, whom alone  
Of all the Gods she worships, she, perchance,  
Shall gain escape from death, or else shall know  
That all her worship is but labour lost.  \[*Exit.*

 

STROPHE.

 

*Chor.*  O Love, in every battle victor owned;  
Love, now assailing wealth and lordly state,  
Now on a girl’s soft cheek,  
Slumbering the livelong night;  
Now wandering o’er the sea,  
And now in shepherd’s folds;  
The Undying Ones have no escape from thee,  
Nor men whose lives are measured as a day;  
And who has thee is mad.

 

ANTISTROPHE.  
Thou makest vile the purpose of the just,  
To his own fatal harm;  
Thou stirrest up this fierce and deadly strife,  
Of men of nearest kin;  
The glowing eyes of bride beloved and fair  
Reign, crowned with victory,  
And dwell on high among the powers that rule,  
Equal with holiest laws;  
For Aphrodite, she whom none subdues,  
Sports in her might divine.  
I, even I, am borne  
Beyond the bounds of right;  
I look on this, and cannot stay  
The fountain of my tears.  
For, lo\! I see her, see Antigone  
Wind her sad, lonely way  
To that dread chamber where is room for all.

 

ANTIG.  Yes\! O ye men of this my fatherland,  
Ye see me on my way,  
Life’s last long journey, gazing on the sun,  
His last rays watching, now and nevermore;  
Alone he leads me, who has room for all,  
Hades, the Lord of Death,  
To Acheron’s dark shore,  
With neither part nor lot in marriage rites,  
No marriage hymn resounding in my ears,  
But Acheron shall claim me as his bride.

 

*Chor.*  And hast thou not all honour, worthiest praise,  
Who goest to the home that hides the dead,  
Not smitten by the sickness that decays,  
Nor by the sword’s sharp edge,  
But of thine own free will, in fullest life,  
To Hades tak’st thy way?

 

ANTIG.  I heard of old her pitiable end,  
Where Sipylus rears high its lofty crag,  
The Phrygian daughter of a stranger land,  
Whom Tantalus begot;  
Whom growth of rugged rock,  
Clinging as ivy clings,  
Subdued, and made its own:  
And now, so runs the tale,  
There, as she melts in shower,  
The snow abideth aye,  
And still bedews yon cliffs that lie below  
Those brows that ever weep.  
With fate like hers doth Fortune bring me low.

 

*Chor.*  Godlike in nature, godlike, too, in birth,  
Was she of whom thou tell’st,  
And we are mortals, born of mortal seed.  
And, lo\! for one who liveth but to die,  
To gain like doom with those of heavenly race  
Is great and strange to hear.

 

ANTIG.  Ye mock me, then. Alas\! Why wait ye not?  
By all our fathers’ Gods, I ask of you,  
Why wait ye not till I have passed away,  
But flout me while I live?  
O city that I love, O men that dwell,  
That city’s wealthiest lords,

 

O Dirkè, fairest fount,  
O grove of Thebes, that boasts her chariot host,  
I take you all to witness, look and see,  
How, with no friends to weep,  
By what stern laws condemned,  
I go to that strong dungeon of the tomb,  
For burial new and strange.  
Oh, miserable me\!  
Whom neither mortal men nor spirits own,  
Nor those that live, nor those that fall asleep.

 

*Chor.*  Forward and forward still to farthest verge  
Of daring hast thou gone,  
And now, O child, thou fallest heavily  
Where Right erects her throne;  
Surely thou payest to the uttermost  
Thy father’s debt of guilt.

 

ANTIG.  Ah\! thou hast touched the quick of all my grief,  
The thrice-told tale of all my father’s woe,  
The fate which dogs us all,  
The race of Labdacus of ancient fame.  
Woe for the curses dire  
Of that defiled bed,  
With foulest incest stained,  
Whence I myself have sprung, most miserable.  
And now, I go to them,  
To sojourn in the grave,  
Bound by a curse, unwed;  
Ah, brother, thou didst find  
Thy marriage fraught with ill,  
And in thy death hast smitten down my life.

 

*Chor.*  Acts reverent and devout  
May claim devotion’s name,  
But power, in one who cares to keep his power,  
May never be defied;  
And thee thy stubborn mood,  
Self-chosen, layeth low.

 

ANTIG.  Unwept, without a friend,  
Unwed, and whelmed in woe,  
I journey on the road that open lies.  
No more shall it be mine \(O misery\!\)  
To look upon the holy eye of day,  
And yet, of all my friends,  
Not one bewails my fate,  
No kindly tear is shed.  
*Enter* CREON

 

CREON.  And know ye not, if men can vantage gain  
By songs and wailings at the hour of death,  
That they will never stop? Lead, lead her on,  
And, as I said, without delay immure  
In yon cavernous tomb, and then depart.  
Leave her, or lone and desolate to die,  
Or, living, in the tomb to find her home.  
Our hands are clean in all that touches her;  
But she no more shall sojourn here with us.

 

ANTIG.  \[*turning towards the cavern*\] O tomb, my bridal chamber, vaulted home,  
Guarded right well for ever, where I go  
To join mine own, of whom, of all that die,  
As most in number Persephassa owns;  
And I, of all the last and lowest, wend  
My way below, life’s little span unfilled.  
And yet I go, and feed myself with hopes  
That I shall meet them, by my father loved,  
Dear to my mother, well-beloved of thee,  
Thou dearest brother: I, with these my hands,  
Washed each dear corpse, arrayed you, poured the stream,  
In rites of burial. And in care for thee,  
Thy body, Polynices, honouring,  
I gain this recompense. And yet ’twas well;  
I had not done it had I come to be  
A mother with her children, — had not dared,  
Though ‘twere a husband dead that mouldered there,  
Against my country’s will to bear this toil,  
And dost thou ask what law constrained me thus?  
I answer, had I lost a husband dear,  
I might have had another; other sons  
By other spouse, if one were lost to me;  
But when my father and my mother sleep  
In Hades, then no brother more can come.  
And therefore, giving thee the foremost place,  
I seemed in Creon’s eyes, O brother dear,  
To sin in boldest daring. So himself,  
He leads me, having taken me by force,  
Cut off from marriage bed and marriage feast,  
Untasting wife’s true joy, or mother’s bliss,  
With infant at her breast, but all forlorn,  
Bereaved of friends, in utter misery,  
Alive, I tread the chambers of the dead.  
What law of Heaven have I transgressed against?  
What use for me, ill-starred one, still to look  
To any God for succour, or to call  
On any friend for aid? For holiest deed  
I bear this charge of rank unholiness.  
If acts like these the Gods on high approve,  
We, taught by suffering, own that we have sinned;  
But if they sin \[*looking at* CREON\], I pray they suffer not  
Worse evils than the wrongs they do to me.

 

*Chor.*  Still do the same wild blasts  
Vex her poor storm-tossed soul.

 

CREON.  Therefore shall these her guards  
Weep sore for this delay.

 

ANTIG.  Ah me\! this word of thine  
Tells of death drawing nigh.

 

CREON.  I cannot bid thee hope  
That other fate is thine.

 

ANTIG.  O citadel of Thebes, my native land,  
Ye Gods of old renown,  
I go, and linger not.  
Behold me. O ye senators of Thebes,  
The last, love scion of the kingly race,  
What things I suffer, and from whom they come,  
Revering still where reverence most is due.  \[*Guards lead* ANTIGONE *away.*

 

STROPHE. I

 

*Chor.*  So Danæ’s form endured of old,  
In brazen palace hid,  
To lose the light of heaven,  
And in her tomblike chamber was enclosed,  
And yet high honour came to her, O child,  
And on her flowed the golden shower of Zeus.  
But great and dread the might of Destiny:  
Nor tempest-storm, nor war,  
Nor tower, nor dark-hulled ships  
That sweep the sea, escape.

 

ANTISTROPHE. I  
Bitter and sharp in mood,  
The son of Dryas, king  
Of yon Edonian tribes,  
By Dionysus’ hands,  
Was shut in prison cave,  
And so his frenzy wild and soul o’erbold  
Waste slowly evermore.  
And he was taught that he, with ribald tongue  
In what wild frenzy, had attacked the Gods.  
For fain had he the Mænad throng brought low,  
And that bright flashing fire,  
And roused the wrath of Muses sweet in song.

 

STROPHE. II  
And by Kyanean waters’ double sea  
Are shores of Bosphorus, and Thracian isle,  
As Salmydessus known, inhospitable,  
Where Ares, God of all the region round,  
Saw the accursed wound  
That smote with blindness Phineus’ twin-born sons  
By a fierce stepdame’s hand, —   
Dark wound, upon the dark-doomed eyeballs struck,  
Not with the stroke of sword,  
But blood-stained hands, on point of spindle sharp.

 

ANTISTROPHE. II  
And they in misery, miserable fate  
Lamenting, waste away,  
Born of a mother wedded to a curse.  
And she who claimed descent  
From men of ancient fame,  
The old Erechteid race,  
Daughter of Boreas, in far distant caves  
Amid her father’s woods,  
Was reared, a child of Gods,  
Swift moving as the steed, o’er lofty crag,  
And yet, my child, on her  
Bore down the Destinies,  
Whose years are infinite.  
*Enter* TEIRESIAS, *guided by a Boy.*

 

TEIR.  Princes of Thebes, we come as travellers joined,  
One seeing for both, for still the blind must use  
A guide’s assistance to direct his steps.

 

CREON.  And what new thing, Teiresias, brings thee here?

 

TEIR.  That I will tell thee, and do thou obey  
The seer who speaks.

 

CREON.  Of old I was not wont  
To differ from thy judgment.

 

TEIR.  Therefore, well  
And safely dost thou steer our good ship’s course.

 

CREON.  I, from experience, bear my witness still  
Of good derived from thee.

 

TEIR.  Bethink thee, then,  
Thou walkest now upon a razor’s edge.

 

CREON.  What means this? Lo\! I shudder at thy speech.

 

TEIR.  Soon shalt thou know, as I unfold the signs  
Of my dread art. For sitting, as of old,  
Upon my ancient seat of augury,  
Where every bird has access, lo\! I hear  
Strange cry of winged creatures, shouting shrill,  
In clamour sharp and savage, and I knew  
That they were tearing each the other’s breast  
With bloody talons, for their whirring wings  
Made that quite clear; and straightway I, in fear,  
Made trial of the sacrifice that lay  
On fiery altar. But the living flame  
Shone not from out the offering; then there oozed  
Upon the ashes, trickling from the bones,  
A moisture, and it bubbled, and it spat,  
And, lo\! the gall was scattered to the air,  
And forth from out the fat that wrapped them round,  
The thigh joints fell. Such omens of decay  
From strange mysterious rites I learnt from him,  
This boy, who now stands here, for he is still  
A guide to me, as I to others am.  
And all this evil falls upon the state,  
From out thy counsels; for our altars all,  
Our sacred hearths, are full of food for dogs  
And birds unclean, the flesh of that poor wretch  
Who fell, the son of Œdipus. And so  
The Gods no longer hear our solemn prayers,  
Nor own the flame that burns the sacrifice;  
Nor do the birds give cry of omen good,  
But feed on carrion of a human corpse.  
Think thou on this, my son: to err, indeed,  
Is common unto all, but having erred,  
He is no longer reckless or unblest,  
Who, having fallen into evil, seeks  
For healing, nor continues still unmoved.  
Self-will must bear the guilt of stubbornness:  
Yield to the dead, and outrage not a corpse.  
What gain is it a fallen foe to slay?  
Good counsel give I, planning good for thee;  
And of all joys the sweetest is to learn  
From one who speaketh well, should that bring gain.

 

CREON.  Old man, as archers aiming at their mark,  
So ye shoot forth your venomed darts at me;  
I know your augur’s skill, and by your arts  
Long since am tricked and sold. Yes, gain your gains,  
Get precious bronze from Sardis, Indian gold,  
That corpse ye shall not hide in any tomb.  
Not though the eagles, birds of Zeus, should bear  
Their carrion morsels to their master’s throne,  
Not even fearing this pollution dire,  
Will I consent to burial. Well I know  
That man is powerless to pollute the Gods.  
But many fall, Teiresias, dotard old,  
A shameful fall, who gloze their shameful words,  
For lucre’s sake, with surface show of good.

 

TEIR.  Ah, me\! Does no man know, does none consider….

 

CREON.  Consider what? What trite poor saw is this?

 

TEIR.  How far good counsel heaped up wealth excels?

 

CREON.  By just so far methinks the greatest hurt  
Is sheer unwisdom.

 

TEIR.  Thou, at least, hast grown  
From head to foot all full of that disease.

 

CREON.  Loath am I with a prophet evil words  
To bandy to and fro.

 

TEIR.  And yet thou dost so,  
Saying that I utter speech that is not true.

 

CREON.  The race of seers is ever fond of gold.

 

TEIR.  And that of tyrants loves the gain that comes  
Of filthy lucre.

 

CREON.  Art thou ignorant, then,  
That what thou say’st, thou speak’st of those that rule?

 

TEIR.  I know it. ’Twas from me thou hadst the state,  
By me preserved.

 

CREON.  Wise art thou as a seer,  
But too much given to wrong and injury.

 

TEIR.  Thou wilt provoke me in my wrath to speak  
Of things best left unspoken.

 

CREON.  Speak them out\!  
Only take heed thou speak them not for gain.

 

TEIR.  And dost thou, then, already judge me thus?

 

CREON.  Know that my judgment is not bought and sold.

 

TEIR.  Know, then, and know it well, that thou shalt see  
Not many winding circuits of the sun,  
Before thou giv’st a quittance for the dead,  
A corpse by thee begotten; for that thou  
Hast trampled to the ground what stood on high,  
And foully placed within a charnel-house  
A living soul. And now thou keep’st from them,  
The Gods below, the corpse of one unblest,  
Unwept, unhallowed. Neither part nor lot  
Hast thou in them, nor have the Gods who rule  
The worlds above, but at thy hands they meet  
This outrage. And for this they wait for thee,  
The sure though slow avengers of the grave,  
The dread Erinyes of the Gods above,  
In these same evils to be snared and caught.  
Search well if I say this as one who sells  
His soul for money. Yet a little while,  
And in thy house men’s wailing, women’s cry,  
Shall make it plain. And every city stirs  
Itself in arms against thee, owning those  
Whose limbs the dogs have buried, or fierce wolves,  
Or winged birds have brought the accursèd taint  
To city’s altar-hearth. Doom like to this,  
Sure darting as an arrow to its mark,  
I launch at thee \(for thou dost grieve me sore\),  
An archer aiming at the very heart,  
And thou shalt not escape its fiery sting.  
And now, O boy, lead thou me home again,  
And let him vent his spleen on younger men,  
And learn to keep his tongue more orderly,  
With better thoughts than this his present mood.  \[*Exit.*

 

*Chor.*  The man has gone, O king, predicting woe,  
And well we know, since first our raven hair  
Was mixed with gray, that never yet his words  
Were uttered to our state and failed of truth.

 

CREON.  I know it too, ’tis that that troubles me.  
To yield is hard, but, holding out, to smite  
One’s soul with sorrow, this is harder still.

 

*Chor.*  Much need is there, O Creon, at this hour,  
Of wisest counsel.

 

CREON.  What, then, should I do?  
Tell me and I will hearken.

 

*Chor.*  Go thou first,  
Release the maiden from her cavern tomb,  
And give a grave to him who lies exposed.

 

CREON.  Is this thy counsel? Dost thou bid me yield?

 

*Chor.*  Without delay, O king, for, lo\! they come,  
The God’s swift-footed ministers of ill,  
And in an instant lay the wicked low.

 

CREON.  Ah, me\! ’tis hard; and yet I bend my will  
To do thy bidding. With necessity  
We must not fight at such o’erwhelming odds.

 

*Chor.*  Go, then, and act\! Commit it not to others.

 

CREON.  E’en as I am I’ll go. Come, come, my men,  
Present or absent, come, and in your hands  
Bring axes. Come to yonder eminence,  
And I, since now my judgment leans that way,  
Who myself bound her, now myself will loose.  
Too much I fear lest it should wisest prove  
To end my life, maintaining ancient laws.  \[*Exit.*

 

STROPHE. I

 

*Chor.*  O thou of many names,  
Of that Cadmeian maid  
The glory and the joy,  
Child of loud-thundering Zeus,  
Who watchest over fair Italia,  
And reign’st o’er all the bays that open wide,  
Which Deo claims on fair Eleusis’ coast:  
Bacchus, who dwell’st in Thebes,  
The mother city of thy Bacchant train,  
Among Ismenus’ stream that glideth on,  
And with the dragon’s brood;

 

ANTISTROPHE. I  
Thee, o’er the double peak of yonder height,  
The flashing blaze beholds,  
Where nymphs of Corycus  
Go forth in Bacchic dance,  
And by Castalia’s stream;  
And thee the ivied slopes of Nysa’s hills,  
And vine-clad promontory,  
While words of more than mortal melody  
Shout out the well-known name,  
Send forth, the guardian lord  
Of all the streets of Thebes.

 

STROPHE. II  
Above all cities thou,  
With her, thy mother, whom the thunder slew,  
Dost look on it with love;  
And now, since all the city bendeth low  
Beneath the sullen plague,  
Come thou with cleansing tread  
O’er the Parnassian slopes,  
Or o’er the moaning straits.

 

ANTISTROPHE. II  
O thou, who lead’st the band  
Of stars still breathing fire,  
Lord of the hymns that echo in the night,  
Offspring of highest Zeus,  
Appear, we pray thee, with thy Naxian train,  
Of Thyian maidens, frenzied, passionate,  
Who all night long, in maddening chorus, sing  
Thy praise, their lord, Iacchus.  
*Enter* Messenger

 

MESS.  Ye men of Cadmus and Amphion’s house,  
I know no life of mortal man which I  
Would either praise or blame. It is but chance  
That raiseth up, and chance that bringeth low,  
The man who lives in good or evil plight,  
And none foretells a man’s appointed lot.  
For Creon, in my judgment, men might watch  
With envy and with wonder, having saved  
This land of Cadmus from the bands of foes;  
And, having ruled with fullest sovereignty,  
He lived and prospered, joyous in a race  
Of goodly offspring. Now, all this is gone;  
For when men lose the joys that sweeten life,  
I cannot count this living, rather deem  
As of a breathing corpse. His heaped-up stores  
Of wealth are large; so be it, and he lives  
With all a sovereign’s state, and yet, if joy  
Be absent, all the rest I count as naught,  
And would not weigh them against pleasure’s charm,  
More than a vapour’s shadow.

 

*Chor.*  What is this?  
What new disaster tell’st thou of our chiefs?

 

MESS.  Dead are they, and the living cause their death.

 

*Chor.*  Who slays, and who is slaughtered? Tell thy tale.

 

MESS.  Hæmon is dead. His own hand sheds his blood.

 

*Chor.*  Was it father’s hand that struck the blow,  
Or his own arm?

 

MESS.  He by himself alone,  
Yet in his wrath he charged his father with it.

 

*Chor.*  O prophet\! true, most true, those words of thine.

 

MESS.  Since thus it stands, we may as well debate  
Of other things in council.

 

*Chor.*  Lo\! there comes  
The wife of Creon, sad Eurydice.  
She from the house is come, or hearing speech  
About her son, or else by chance.  
*Enter* EURYDICE

 

EURYD.  My friends,  
I on my way without, as suppliant bound  
To pay my vows at Pallas’ shrine, have heard  
Your words, and so I chanced to slip the bolt  
Of the half-opened door, when, lo\! a sound  
Falls on my ears of evil near at hand,  
And terror-struck I fell in deadly swoon  
Back in my handmaids’ arms; yet tell it me,  
Tell the tale once again, for I shall hear,  
By long experience disciplined to grief.

 

MESS.  Dear lady, I will tell thee: I was by,  
And will not leave one word of truth untold.  
Why should we smooth and gloze, when all too soon  
We should be found as liars? Truth is still  
The best and wisest. Lo\! I went with him,  
Thy husband, in attendance, to the height  
Of yonder plain, where still all ruthlessly  
The corpse of Polynices tombless lay,  
Mangled by dogs. And, having prayed to her,  
The Goddess of all pathways, and to Pluto,  
To look with favour on them, him they washed  
With holy water; and what yet was left  
We burnt in branches freshly cut, and heaped  
A high raised grave from out the soil around,  
And then we entered on the stone-paved home,  
Death’s marriage-chamber for the ill-starred maid.  
And some one hears, while standing yet afar,  
Shrill voice of wailing near the bridal bower,  
By funeral rites unhallowed, and he comes  
And tells my master, Creon. On his ears,  
Advancing nearer, falls a shriek confused  
Of bitter sorrow, and with grieving loud,  
He utters one sad cry: “Me miserable\!  
And am I, then, a prophet? Do I wend  
This day the dreariest way of all my life?  
My son’s voice greets me. Go, my servants, go,  
Quickly draw near, and standing by the tomb,  
Search ye and see; and where the joined stones  
Still leave an opening, look ye in, and say  
If I hear Hæmon’s voice, or if my soul  
Is cheated by the Gods.” And then we searched,  
As he, our master, in his frenzy, bade us;  
And, in the furthest corner of the vault,  
We saw her hanging by a twisted cord  
Of linen threads entwined, and him we found  
Clasping her form in passionate embrace,  
And mourning o’er the doom that robbed him of her,  
His father’s deed, and that his marriage bed,  
So full of sorrow. When he saw him there,  
Groaning again in bitterness of heart,  
He goes to him, and calls in wailing voice,  
“Ah\! wretched me\! what dost thou\! Hast thou lost  
Thy reason? In what evil sinkest thou?  
Come forth, my child, on bended knee I ask thee.”  
And then the boy, with fierce, wild gleaming eyes,  
Glared at him, spat upon his face, and draws,  
Still answering naught, the sharp two-edged sword.  
Missing his aim \(his father from the blow  
Turning aside\), in anger with himself,  
The poor ill-doomed one, even as he was,  
Fell on his sword, and drove it through his breast,  
Full half its length, and clasping, yet alive,  
The maiden’s arm, still soft, he there breathes out  
In broken gasps, upon her fair white cheek,  
A rain of blood. And so at last they lie,  
Dead bridegroom with dead bride, and he has gained  
His marriage rites in Hades’ darksome home,  
And left to all men witness terrible,  
That man’s worst ill is stubbornness of heart.  \[*Exit* EURYDICE.

 

*Chor.*  What dost thou make of this? She turns again,  
And not one word, or good or ill, will speak.

 

MESS.  I, too, am full of wonder. Yet with hopes  
I feed myself, she will not think it meet,  
Hearing her son’s woes, openly to wail  
Before her subjects, but beneath her roof  
Will think it best to bear her private griefs.  
Too trained a judgment has she so to err.

 

*Chor.*  I know not. To my mind, or silence hard,  
Or vain wild cries, are signs of bitter woe.

 

MESS.  Soon we shall know, within the house advancing,  
If, in the passion of her heart, she hides  
A secret purpose. Truly dost thou speak;  
There is a terror in that silence hard.

 

*Chor.*  \[*seeing* CREON *approaching with the corpse of* HÆMON *in his arms*\]  And, lo\! the king himself comes on,  
And in his hands he bears a record clear,  
No woe \(if I may speak\) by others caused,  
Himself the great offender.  
*Enter* CREON *bearing* HÆMON’S *body*

 

CREON.  Woe\! for the sins of souls of evil mood,  
Strong, mighty to destroy;  
O ye who look on those of kindred race,  
The slayers and the slain,  
Woe for mine own rash plans that prosper not;  
Woe for thee, son; but new in life’s career,  
And by a new fate dying.  
Woe\! woe\!  
Thou diest, thou art gone,  
Not by thine evil counsel, but by mine.

 

*Chor.*  Ah me\! Too late thou seem’st to see the right.

 

CREON.  Ah me\!  
I learn the grievous lesson. On my head,  
God, pressing sore, hath smitten me and vexed,  
In ways most rough and terrible \(ah me\!\),  
Shattering the joy, and trampling underfoot.  
Woe\! woe\! We toil for that which profits not.  
*Enter* Second Messenger

 

SEC. MESS.  My master\! thou, as one who hast full store,  
One source of sorrow bearest in thine arms,  
And others in thy house, too soon, it seems,  
Thou need’st must come and see.

 

CREON.  And what remains  
Worse evil than the evils that we bear?

 

SEC. MESS.  Thy wife is dead. Thy dead son’s mother true,  
Ill starred one, smitten with a deadly blow,  
But some few moments since.

 

CREON.  O agony?  
Thou house of Death, that none may purify,  
Why dost thou thus destroy me?  
O thou who comest, bringing in thy train  
Woes horrible to tell,  
Thou tramplest on a man already slain.  
What say’st thou? What new tidings bring’st to me?  
Ah me\! ah me\!  
Is it that over all the slaughter wrought  
My own wife’s death has come to crown it all?

 

*Chor.*  It is but all too clear\! No longer now  
Does yon recess conceal her.  \[*The gates open and show the dead body of* EURYDICE.

 

CREON.  Woe is me\!  
This second stroke I gaze on, miserable,  
What fate, yea, what still lies in wait for me?  
Here in my arms I bear what was my son;  
And there, O misery\! look upon the dead.  
Ah, wretched mother\! ah, my son\! my son\!

 

SEC. MESS.  Sore wounded, she around the altar clung,  
And closed her darkening eyelids, and bewailed  
The honoured bed of Megareus, who died  
Long since, and then again that corpse thou hast;  
And last of all she cried a bitter cry  
Against thy deeds, the murderer of thy son.

 

CREON.  Woe\! woe\! alas\!  
I shudder in my fear: Will no one strike  
A deadly blow with sharp two-edgèd sword?  
Fearful my fate, alas\!  
And with a fearful woe full sore beset.

 

SEC. MESS.  She in her death charged thee with being the cause  
Of all their sorrows, his and hers alike.

 

CREON.  And in what way struck she the murderous blow?

 

SEC. MESS.  With her own hand below her heart she stabbed,  
Hearing her son’s most pitiable fate.

 

CREON.  Ah me\! The fault is mine. On no one else,  
Of all that live, the fearful guilt can come;  
I, even I, did slay thee, wretched one,  
I; yes, I say it clearly. Come, ye guards,  
Lead me forth quickly; lead me out of sight,  
More crushed to nothing than the dead unborn.

 

*Chor.*  Thou counsellest gain, if gain there be in ills,  
For present evils then are easiest borne  
When shortest lived.

 

CREON.  Oh, come thou, then, come thou,  
Last of my sorrows, that shall bring to me  
Best boon, my life’s last day. Come, then, oh, come  
That nevermore I look upon the light.

 

*Chor.*  These things are in the future. What is near,  
That we must do. O’er what is yet to come  
They watch, to whom that work of right belongs.

 

CREON.  I did but pray for what I most desire.

 

*Chor.*  Pray thou for nothing more. For mortal man  
There is no issue from a doom decreed.

 

CREON.  \[*looking at the two corpses*\]  Lead me, then, forth,  
vain shadow that I am,  
Who slew thee, O my son, unwittingly,  
And thee, too — \(O my sorrow\) — and I know not  
Which way to look. All near at hand is turned  
Aside to evil; and upon my head  
There falls a doom far worse than I can bear.

 

*Chor.*  Man’s highest blessedness  
In wisdom chiefly stands;  
And in the things that touch upon the Gods,  
’Tis best in word of deed  
To shun unholy pride;  
Great words of boasting bring great punishments;  
And so to gray-haired age  
Comes wisdom at the last.

EURIPIDES, THE YOUNGEST of the trio of great Greek tragedians, was born at Salamis in 480 B. C., on the day when the Greeks won their momentous naval victory there over the fleet of the Persians. The precise social status of his parents is not clear, but he received a good education, was early distinguished as an athlete, and showed talent in painting and oratory. He was a fellow student of Pericles, and his dramas show the influence of the philosophical ideas of Anaxagoras and of Socrates, with whom he was personally intimate. Like Socrates, he was accused of impiety, and this, along with domestic infelicity, has been supposed to afford a motive for his withdrawal from Athens, first to Magnesia and later to the Court of Archelaüs in Macedonia, where he died in 406 B. C.

The first tragedy of Euripides was produced when he was about twenty-five, and he was several times a victor in the tragic contests. In spite of the antagonisms which he aroused and the criticisms which were hurled upon him in, for example, the comedies of Aristophanes, he attained a very great popularity; and Plutarch tells that those Athenians who were taken captive in the disastrous Sicilian expedition of 413 B. C. were offered freedom by their captors if they could recite from the works of Euripides. Of the hundred and twenty dramas ascribed to Euripides, there have come down to us complete eighteen tragedies and one satyric drama, “Cyclops,” besides numerous fragments.

The works of Euripides are generally regarded as showing the beginning of the decline of Greek tragedy. The idea of Fate, hitherto dominant in the plays of his predecessors, tends to be degraded by hint into mere chance; the characters lose much of their ideal quality; and even gods and heroes are represented as moved by the petty motives of ordinary humanity. The chorus is often quite detached from the action; the poetry is florid; and the action is frequently tinged with sensationalism. In spite of all this, Euripides remains a great poet; and his picturesqueness and tendencies to what are now called realism and romanticism, while marking his inferiority to the chaste classicism of Sophocles, bring him more easily within the sympathetic interest of the modern reader.

APHRODITE

 

GREAT among men, and not unnamed am I,  
The Cyprian, in God’s inmost halls on high.  
And wheresoe’er from Pontus to the far  
Red West men dwell, and see the glad day-star,  
And worship Me, the pious heart I bless,  
And wreck that life that lives in stubbornness.  
For that there is, even in a great God’s mind,  
That hungereth for the praise of human kind.  
So runs my word; and soon the very deed  
Shall follow. For this Prince of Theseus’ seed,  
Hippolytus, child of that dead Amazon,  
And reared by saintly Pittheus in his own  
Strait ways, bath dared, alone of all Trozên,  
To hold me least of spirits and most mean,  
And spurns my spell and seeks no woman’s kiss.  
But great Apollo’s sister, Artemis,  
He holds of all most high, gives love and praise,  
And through the wild dark woods for ever strays,  
He and the Maid together, with swift hounds  
To slay all angry beasts from out these bounds,  
To more than mortal friendship consecrate\!  
I grudge it not. No grudge know I, nor hate;  
Yet, seeing he bath offended, I this day  
Shall smite Hippolytus. Long since my way  
Was opened, nor needs now much labour more.  
For once from Pittheus’ castle to the shore  
Of Athens came Hippolytus over-seas  
Seeking the vision of the Mysteries.  
And Phædra there, his father’s Queen high-born;  
Saw him, and as she saw, her heart was torn  
With great love, by the working of my will.  
And for his sake, long since, on Pallas’ hill,  
Deep in the rock, that Love no more might roam,  
She built a shrine, and named it *Love-at-home:*  
And the rock held it, but its face alway  
Seeks Trozên o’er the seas. Then came the day  
When Theseus, for the blood of kinsmen shed,  
Spake doom of exile on himself, and fled,  
Phædra beside him, even to this Trozên.  
And here that grievous and amazèd Queen,  
Wounded and wondering, with ne’er a word,  
Wastes slowly; and her secret none bath heard  
Nor dreamed.  
 But never thus this love shall end\!  
To Theseus’ ear some whisper will I send,  
And all be bare\! And that proud Prince, my foe,  
His sire shall slay with curses. Even so  
Endeth that boon the great Lord of the Main  
To Theseus gave, the Three Prayers not in vain.  
And she, not in dishonour, yet shall die.  
I would not rate this woman’s pain so high  
As not to pay mine haters in full fee  
That vengeance that shall make all well with me.  
But soft, here comes he, striding from the chase,  
Our Prince Hippolytus\! — I will go my ways. —   
And hunters at his heels: and a loud throng  
Glorying Artemis with praise and song\!  
Little he knows that Hell’s gates opened are,  
And this his last look on the great Day-star\!  \[APHRODITE *withdraws, unseen by* HIPPOLYTUS *and a band of huntsmen, who enter from the left, singing. They pass the Statue of* APHRODITE *without notice.*

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Follow, O follow me,  
Singing on your ways  
Her in whose hand are we,  
Her whose own flock we be,  
The Zeus-Child the Heavenly;  
To Artemis be praise\!

 

HUNTSMAN  
Hail to thee, Maiden blest,  
Proudest and holiest:  
God’s Daughter, great in bliss,  
Leto-born, Artemis\!  
Hail to thee, Maiden, far  
Fairest of all that are,  
Yea, and most high thine home,  
Child of the Father’s hall;  
Hear, O most virginal,  
Hear, O most fair of all,  
In high God’s golden dome.  \[*The huntsmen have gathered about the altar of* ARTEMIS. HIPPOLYTUS *now advances from them, and approaches the Statue with a wreath in his hand.*

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
To thee this wreathèd garland, from a green  
And virgin meadow bear I, O my Queen,  
Where never shepherd leads his grazing ewes  
Nor scythe has touched. Only the river dews  
Gleam, and the spring bee sings, and in the glade  
Hath Solitude her mystic garden made.  
No evil hand may cull it: only he  
Whose heart bath known the heart of Purity,  
Unlearned of man, and true whate’er befall.  
Take therefore from pure hands this coronal,  
O mistress loved, thy golden hair to twine.  
For, sole of living men, this grace is mine,  
To dwell with thee, and speak, and hear replies  
Of voice divine, though none may see thine eyes.  
Oh, keep me to the end in this same road\!  \[*An* OLD HUNTSMAN, *who has stood apart from the rest, here comes up to* HIPPOLYTUS.

 

HUNTSMAN  
My Prince — for “Master” name I none but God —   
Gave I good counsel, wouldst thou welcome it?

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Right gladly, friend; else were I poor of wit.

 

HUNTSMAN  
Knowest thou one law, that through the world has won?

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
What wouldst thou? And how runs thy law? Say on.

 

HUNTSMAN  
It hates that Pride that speaks not all men fair\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
And rightly. Pride breeds hatred everywhere.

 

HUNTSMAN  
And good words love, and grace in all men’s sight?

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Aye, and much gain withal, for trouble slight.

 

HUNTSMAN  
How deem’st thou of the Gods? Are they the same?

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Surely: we are but fashioned on their frame.

 

HUNTSMAN  
Why then wilt thou be proud, and worship not…

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Whom? If the name he speakable, speak out\!

 

HUNTSMAN  
She stands here at thy gate the Cyprian Queen\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
I greet her from afar: my life is clean.

 

HUNTSMAN  
Clean? Nay, proud, proud; a mark for all to scan\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Each mind hath its own bent, for God or man.

 

HUNTSMAN  
God grant thee happiness … and wiser thought\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
These Spirits that reign in darkness like me not.

 

HUNTSMANWhat the Gods ask, O Son, that man must pay\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS \(*turning from him to the others*\).  
On, huntsmen, to the Castle\! Make your way  
Straight to the feast room; ’tis a merry thing  
After the chase, a board of banqueting.  
And see the steeds be groomed, and in array  
The chariot dight. I drive them forth to-day.  \[*He pauses, and makes a slight gesture of reverence to the Statue on the left. Then to the* OLD HUNTSMAN.  
That for thy Cyprian, friend, and nought beside\!  \[HIPPOLYTUS *follows the huntsmen, who stream off by the central door in the Castle. The* OLD HUNTSMAN *remains.*

 

HUNTSMAN \(*approaching the Statue and kneeling*\)

 

O Cyprian — for a young man in his pride  
I will not follow\! — here before thee, meek,  
In that one language that a slave may speak,  
I pray thee; Oh, if some wild heart in froth  
Of youth surges against thee, be not wroth  
For ever\! Nay, be far and hear not then:  
Gods should be gentler and more wise than men\!  \[*He rises and follows the others into the Castle.*  
*The Orchestra is empty for a moment, then there enter from right and left several Trozenian women, young and old. Their number eventually amounts to fifteen.*

 

CHORUS  
  There riseth a rock-born river,  
Of Ocean’s tribe, men say;  
The crags of it gleam and quiver,  
And pitchers dip in the spray:  
A woman was there with raiment white  
To bathe and spread in the warm sunlight,  
And she told a tale to me there by the river,  
The tale of the Queen and her evil day:  
How, ailing beyond allayment,  
Within she hath bowed her head,  
And with shadow of silken raiment  
The bright brown hair bespread.  
For three long days she hath lain forlorn,  
Her lips untainted of flesh or corn,  
For that secret sorrow beyond allayment  
That steers to the far sad shore of the dead.  
*Some Women*  
Is this some Spirit, O child of man?  
Doth Hecat hold thee perchance, or Pan?  
Doth she of the Mountains work her ban,  
Or the dread Corybantes bind thee?  
*Others*  
Nay, is it sin that upon thee lies,  
Sin of forgotten sacrifice,  
In thine own Dictynna’s sea-wild eyes?  
Who in Limna here can find thee;  
For the Deep’s dry floor is her easy way,  
And she moves in the salt wet whirl of the spray.  
*Other Women*  
Or doth the Lord of Erechtheus’ race,  
Thy Theseus, watch for a fairer face,  
For secret arms in a silent place,  
Far from thy love or chiding?  
*Others*  
Or hath there landed, amid the loud  
Hum of Piraeus’ sailor-crowd,  
Some Cretan venturer, weary-browed,  
Who bears to the Queen some tiding;  
Some far home-grief, that bath bowed her low,  
And chained her soul to a bed of woe?  
*An Older Woman*  
Nay — know yet not? — this burden hath alway lain  
On the devious being of woman; yea, burdens twain,  
The burden of Wild Will and the burden of Pain.  
Through my heart once that wind of terror sped;  
But I, in fear confessèd,  
Cried from the dark to Her in heavenly bliss,  
The Helper of Pain, the Bow-Maid Artemis:  
Whose feet I praise for ever, where they tread  
Far off among the blessèd\!

 

THE LEADER  
But see, the Queen’s grey nurse at the door,  
Sad-eyed and sterner, methinks, than of yore,  
With the Queen. Doth she lead her hither,  
To the wind and sun? — Ah, fain would I know  
What strange betiding hath blanched that brow,  
And made that young life wither.  \[*The* NURSE *comes out from the central door, followed by* PHAEDRA, *who is supported by two handmaids. They make ready a couch for* PHAEDRA *to lie upon.*

 

NURSE  
O sick and sore are the days of men\!  
What wouldst thou? What shall I change again?  
Here is the Sun for thee; here is the sky;  
And thy weary pillows wind-swept lie,  
By the castle door.  
But the cloud of thy brow is dark, I ween;  
And soon thou wilt back to thy bower within:  
So swift to change is the path of thy feet,  
And near things hateful, and far things sweet;  
So was it before\!  
Oh, pain were better than tending pain\!  
For that were single, and this is twain,  
With grief of heart and labour of limb.  
Yet all man’s life is but ailing and dim,  
And rest upon earth comes never.  
But if any far-off state there be,  
Dearer than life to mortality;  
The hand of the Dark hath hold thereof,  
And mist is under and mist above.  
And so we are sick of life, and cling  
On earth to this nameless and shining thing.  
For other life is a fountain sealed,  
And the deeps below are unrevealed,  
And we drift on legends for ever\!  \[PHAEDRA *during this has been laid on her couch; she speaks to the handmaids.*

 

PHAEDRA  
Yes; lift me: not my head so low.  
There, hold my arms. — Fair arms they seem\! —   
My poor limbs scarce obey me now\!  
Take off that hood that weighs my brow,  
And let my long hair stream.

 

NURSE  
Nay, toss not, Child, so feveredly.  
The sickness best will win relief  
By quiet rest and constancy.  
All men have grief.

 

PHAEDRA \(*not noticing her*\)  
Oh for a deep and dewy spring,  
With runlets cold to draw and drink?  
And a great meadow blossoming,  
Long-grassed, and poplars in a ring,  
To rest me by the brink\!

 

NURSE  
Nay, Child\! Shall strangers hear this tone  
So wild, and thoughts so fever-flown?

 

PHAEDRA  
Oh, take me to the Mountain\! Oh,  
Past the great pines and through the wood,  
Up where the lean hounds softly go,  
A-whine for wild things’ blood,  
And madly flies the dappled roe.

 

O God, to shout and speed them there,  
An arrow by my chestnut hair  
Drawn tight, and one keen glimmering spear —   
Ah\! if I could\!

 

NURSE  
What wouldst thou with them — fancies all\! —   
Thy hunting and thy fountain brink?  
What wouldst thou? By the city wall  
Canst hear our own brook plash and fall  
Downhill, if thou wouldst drink.

 

PHAEDRA

 

O Mistress of the Sea-lorn Mere  
Where horse-hoofs beat the sand and sing,

 

O Artemis, that I were there  
To tame Enetian steeds and steer  
Swift chariots in the ring\!

 

NURSE  
Nay, mountainward but now thy hands  
Yearned out, with craving for the chase;  
And now toward the unseaswept sands  
Thou roamest, where the coursers pace\!  
O wild young steed, what prophet knows  
The power that holds thy curb, and throws  
Thy swift heart from its race?  \[*At these words* PHAEDRA *gradually recovers herself and pays attention.*

 

PHAEDRA  
What have I said? Woe’s me\! And where  
Gone straying from my wholesome mind?  
What? Did I fall in some god’s snare?  
 — Nurse, veil my head again, and blind  
Mine eyes. — There is a tear behind  
That lash. — Oh, I am sick with shame\!  
Aye, but it hath a sting,  
To come to reason: yet the name  
Of madness is an awful thing. — 

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Could I but die in one swift flame  
Unthinking, unknowing\!

 

NURSE  
I veil thy face, Child. — Would that so  
Mine own were veiled for evermore,  
So sore I love thee\!… Though the lore  
Of long life mocks me, and I know  
How love should be a lightsome thing  
Not rooted in the deep o’ the heart;  
With gentle ties, to twine apart  
If need so call, or closer cling. —   
Why do I love thee so? O fool,  
O fool, the heart that bleeds for twain,  
And builds, men tell us, wails of pain,  
To walk by love’s unswerving rule  
The same for ever, stern and true\!  
For “Thorough” is no word of peace:  
’Tis “Naught-too-much” makes trouble cease.  
And many a wise man bows thereto.  \[*The* LEADER OF THE CHORUS *here approaches the* NURSE.

 

LEADER  
Nurse of our Queen, thou watcher old and true,  
We see her great affliction, but no clue  
Have we to learn the sickness. Wouldst thou tell  
The name and sort thereof, ’twould like us well.

 

NURSE  
Small leechcraft have I, and she tells no man.

 

LEADER  
Thou know’st no cause? Nor when the unrest began?

 

NURSE  
It all comes to the same. She will not speak.

 

LEADER \(*turning and looking at* PHAEDRA\).  
How she is changed and wasted\! And how weak\!

 

NURSE  
’Tis the third day she hath fasted utterly.

 

LEADER  
What, is she mad? Or doth she seek to die?

 

NURSE  
I know not. But to death it sure must lead.

 

LEADER  
’Tis strange that Theseus takes hereof no heed.

 

NURSE  
She hides her wound, and vows it is not so.

 

LEADER  
Can he not look into her face and know?

 

NURSE  
Nay, he is on a journey these last days.

 

LEADER  
Canst thou not force her, then? Or think of ways  
To trap the secret of the sick heart’s pain?

 

NURSE  
Have I not tried all ways, and all in vain?  
Yet will I cease not now, and thou shalt tell  
If in her grief I serve my mistress well\!  \[*She goes across to where* PHAEDRA *lies; and presently, while speaking, kneels by her.*  
Dear daughter mine, all that before was said  
Let both of us forget; and thou instead  
Be kindlier, and unlock that prisoned brow.  
And I, who followed then the wrong road, now  
Will leave it and be wiser. If thou fear  
Some secret sickness, there be women here  
To give thee comfort.  \[PHAEDRA *shakes her head*  
         No; not secret? Then  
Is it a sickness meet for aid of men?  
Speak, that a leech may tend thee.  
                       Silent still?  
Nay, Child, what profits silence? If ’tis ill  
This that I counsel, make me see the wrong:  
If well, then yield to me.  
               Nay, Child, I long  
For one kind word, one look\!  \[PHAEDRA *lies motionless. The* NURSE *rises.*  
                 Oh, woe is me\!  
Women, we labour here all fruitlessly,  
All as far off as ever from her heart\!  
She ever scorned me, and now hears no part  
Of all my prayers\!  \[*Turning to* PHAEDRA *again.*  
     Nay, hear thou shalt, and be,  
If so thou will, more wild than the wild sea;  
But know, thou art thy little ones’ betrayer\!  
If thou die now, shall child of thine be heir  
To Theseus’ castle? Nay, not thine, I ween,  
But hers\! That barbed Amazonian Queen  
Hath left a child to bend thy children low,  
A bastard royal-hearted — sayst not so? —   
Hippolytus…

 

PHAEDRA  
Ah\!  \[*She starts up, sitting, and throws the veil off.*

 

NURSE  
That stings thee?

 

PHAEDRA  
Nurse, most sore  
Thou hast hurt me\! In God’s name, speak that name no more.

 

NURSE  
Thou seest? Thy mind is clear; but with thy mind  
Thou wilt not save thy children, nor be kind  
To thine own life.

 

PHAEDRA  
My children? Nay, most dear  
I love them, — Far, far other grief is here.

 

NURSE \(*after a pause, wondering*\).  
Thy hand is clean, O Child, from stain of blood?

 

PHAEDRA  
My hand is clean; but is my heart, O God?

 

NURSE  
Some enemy’s spell hath made thy spirit dim?

 

PHAEDRA  
He hates me not that slays me, nor I him.

 

NURSE  
Theseus, the King, hath wronged thee in man’s wise?

 

PHAEDRA  
Ah, could but I stand guiltless in his eyes\!

 

NURSE  
O speak\! What is this death-fraught mystery?

 

PHAEDRA  
Nay, leave me to my wrong. I wrong not thee.

 

NURSE \(*suddenly throwing herself in supplication at* PHAEDRA’S *feet*\).  
Not wrong me, whom thou wouldst all desolate leave\!

 

PHAEDRA \(*rising and trying to move away*\).  
What wouldst thou? Force me? Slinging to my sleeve?

 

NURSE  
Yea, to thy knees; and weep; and let not go\!

 

PHAEDRA  
Woe to thee, Woman, if thou learn it, woe\!

 

NURSE  
I know no bitterer woe than losing thee.

 

PHAEDRA  
I am lost\! Yet the deed shall honour me.

 

NURSE  
Why hide what honours thee? ’Tis all I claim\!

 

PHAEDRA  
Why, so I build up honour out of shame\!

 

NURSE  
Then speak, and higher still thy fame shall stand.

 

PHAEDRA  
Go, in God’s name\! — Nay, leave me; loose my hand\!

 

NURSE  
Never, until thou grant me what I pray.

 

PHAEDRA \(*yielding, after a pause*\).  
So be it. I dare not tear that hand away.

 

NURSE \(*rising and releasing* PHAEDRA\).  
Tell all thou wilt, Daughter. I speak no more.

 

PHAEDRA \(*after a long pause*\).  
Mother, poor Mother, that didst love so sore\!

 

NURSE  
What mean’st thou, Child? The Wild Bull of the Tide?

 

PHAEDRA  
And thou, sad sister, Dionysus’ bride\!

 

NURSE  
Child\! wouldst thou shame the house where thou wast born?

 

PHAEDRA  
And I the third, sinking most all-forlorn\!

 

NURSE \(*to herself*\)  
I am all lost and feared. What will she say?

 

PHAEDRA  
From there my grief comes, not from yesterday.

 

NURSE  
I come no nearer to thy parable.

 

PHAEDRA  
Oh, would that thou could’st tell what I must tell\!

 

NURSE  
I am no seer in things I wot not of.

 

PHAEDRA \(*again hesitating*\)  
What is it that they mean, who say men … love?

 

NURSE  
A thing most sweet, my Child, yet dolorous.

 

PHAEDRA  
Only the half, belike, hath fallen on us\!

 

NURSE \(*starting*\)  
On thee? Love? — Oh, what say’st thou? What man’s son?

 

PHAEDRA  
What man’s? There was a Queen, an Amazon…

 

NURSE  
Hippolytus, say’st thou?

 

PHAEDRA \(*again wrapping her face in the veil*\)  
Nay, ’twas thou, not I\!  \[PHAEDRA *sinks back on the couch and covers her face again. The* NURSE *starts violently from her and walks up and down.*

 

NURSE

 

O God what wilt thou say, Child? Wouldst thou try  
To kill me? — Oh, ’tis more than I can bear;  
Women, I will no more of it, this glare  
Of hated day, this shining of the sky.  
I will fling down my body, and let it lie  
Till life he gone\!  
       Women, God rest with you,  
My works are over\! For the pure and true  
Are forced to evil, against their own heart’s vow,  
And love it\!  \[*She suddenly sees the Statute of* CYPRIS, *and stands with her eyes riveted upon it.*  
 Ah, Cyprian\! No god art thou,  
But more than god, and greater, that hath thrust  
Me and my queen and all our house to dust\!  \[*She throws herself on the ground close to the statue.*

 

CHORUS  
*Some Women*

 

O Women, have ye heard? Nay, dare ye hear  
The desolate cry, of the young Queen’s misery?

 

*A Woman*  
My Queen, I love thee dear,  
Yet liefer were I dead than framed like thee.  
*Others*  
Woe, woe to me for this thy bitter bane,  
Surely the food man feeds upon is pain\!  
*Others*  
How wilt thou bear thee through this livelong day,  
Lost, and thine evil naked to the light?  
Strange things are close upon us — who shall say  
How strange? — save one thing that is plain to sight,  
The stroke of the Cyprian and the fall thereof  
On thee, thou child of the Isle of fearful Love\!  \[PHAEDRA *during this has risen from the couch and comes forward collectedly. As she speaks the* NURSE *gradually rouses herself, and listens more calmly.*

 

PHAEDRA

 

O Women, dwellers in this portal-seat  
Of Pelops’ land, gazing towards my Crete,  
How oft, in other days than these, have I  
Through night’s long hours thought of man’s misery,  
And how this life is wrecked\! And, to mine eyes,  
Not in man’s knowledge, not in wisdom, lies  
The lack that makes for sorrow. Nay, we scan  
And know the right — for wit bath many a man —   
But will not to the last end strive and serve.  
For some grow too soon weary, and some swerve  
To other paths, setting before the Right  
The diverse far-off image of Delight:  
And many are delights beneath the sun\!  
Long hours of converse; and to sit alone  
Musing — a deadly happiness\! — and Shame:  
Though two things there he hidden in one name,  
And Shame can be slow poison if it will;  
This is the truth I saw then, and see still;  
Nor is there any magic that can stain  
That white truth for me, or make me blind again.  
Come, I will show thee how my spirit hath moved.  
When the first stab came, and I knew I loved,  
I cast about how best to face mine ill.  
And the first thought that came, was to be still  
And hide my sickness. — For no trust there is  
In man’s tongue, that so well admonishes  
And counsels and betrays, and waxes fat  
With griefs of its own gathering\! — After that  
I would my madness bravely bear, and try  
To conquer by mine own heart’s purity.  
My third mind, when these two availed me naught  
To quell love was to die — \[*Motion of protest among the Women.*  
             — the best, best thought —   
 — Gainsay me not — of all that man can say\!  
I would not have mine honour hidden away;  
Why should I have my shame before men’s eyes  
Kept living? And I knew, in deadly wise,  
Shame was the deed and shame the suffering;  
And I a woman, too, to face the thing,  
Despised of all\!  
     Oh, utterly accurst  
Be she of women, whoso dared the first  
To cast her honour out to a strange man\!  
’Twas in some great house, surely, that began  
This plague upon us; then the baser kind,  
When the good led towards evil, followed blind  
And joyous\! Cursed be they whose lips are clean  
And wise and seemly, but their hearts within  
Rank with bad daring\! How can they, O Thou  
That walkest on the waves, great Cyprian, how  
Smile in their husbands’ faces, and not fall,  
Not cower before the Darkness that knows all,  
Aye, dread the dead still chambers, lest one day  
The stones find voice, and all be finished\!  
                               Nay,  
Friends, ’tis for this I die; lest I stand there  
Having shamed my husband and the babes I bare,  
In ancient Athens they shall some day dwell,  
My babes, free men, free-spoken, honourable,  
And when one asks their mother, proud of me\!  
For, oh, it cows a man, though bold he be,  
To know a mother’s or a father’s sin.  
’Tis written, one way is there, one, to win  
This life’s race, could man keep it from his birth,  
A true clean spirit. And through all this earth  
To every false man, that hour comes apace  
When Time holds up a mirror to his face,  
And girl-like, marvelling, there he stares to see  
How foul his heart\! Be it not so with me\!

 

LEADER OF CHORUS  
Ah, God, bow sweet is virtue, and how wise,  
And honour its due meed in all men’s eyes\!

 

NURSE \(*who has now risen and recovered herself*\)  
Mistress, a sharp swift terror struck me low  
A moment since, hearing of this thy woe,  
But now — I was a coward\! And men say  
Our second thought the wiser is alway.  
This is no monstrous thing; no grief too dire  
To meet with quiet thinking. In her ire  
A most strong goddess bath swept down on thee.  
Thou lovest. Is that so strange? Many there be  
Beside thee\!… And because thou lovest, wilt fall  
And die\! And must all lovers die, then? All  
That are or shall be? A blithe law for them\!  
Nay, when in might she swoops, no strength can stem  
Cypris; and if man yields him, she is sweet;  
But is he proud and stubborn? From his feet  
She lifts him, and — how think you? — flings to scorn\!  
She ranges with the stars of eve and morn,  
She wanders in the heaving of the sea,  
And all life lives from her. — Aye, this is she  
That sows Love’s seed and brings Love’s fruit to birth;  
And great Love’s brethren are all we on earth\!  
Nay, they who con grey books of ancient days  
Or dwell among the Muses, tell — and praise —   
How Zeus himself once yearned for Semelê;  
How maiden Eôs in her radiancy  
Swept Kephalos to heaven away, away,  
For sore love’s sake. And there they dwell, men say,  
And fear not, fret not; for a thing too stern  
Hath met and crushed them\!  
               And must thou, then, turn  
And struggle? Sprang there from thy father’s blood  
Thy little soul all lonely? Or the god  
That rules thee, is he other than our gods?  
Nay, yield thee to men’s ways, and kiss their rods\!  
How many, deem’st thou, of men good and wise  
Know their own home’s blot, and avert their eyes?  
How many fathers, when a son has strayed  
And toiled beneath the Cyprian, bring him aid,  
Not chiding? And man’s wisdom e’er hath been  
To keep what is not good to see, unseen\!  
A straight and perfect life is not for man;  
Nay, in a shut house, let him, if he can,  
‘Mid sheltered rooms, make all lines true. But here,  
Out in the wide sea fallen, and full of fear,  
Hopest thou so easily to swim to land?  
Canst thou but set thine ill days on one hand  
And more good days on the other, verily,  
O child of woman, life is well with thee\!  \[*She pauses, and then draws nearer to* PHAEDRA.  
Nay, dear my daughter, cease thine evil mind,  
Cease thy fierce pride\! For pride it is, and blind,  
To seek to outpass gods\! — Love on and dare:  
A god hath willed it\! And, since pain is there,  
Make the pain sleep\! Songs are there to bring calm,  
And magic words. And I shall find the balm,  
Be sure, to heal thee. Else in sore dismay  
Were men, could not we women find our way\!

 

LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
Help is there, Queen, in all this woman says,  
To ease thy suffering. But ’tis thee I praise;  
Albeit that praise is harder to thine ear  
Than all her chiding was, and bitterer\!

 

PHAEDRA  
Oh, this it is hath flung to dogs and birds  
Men’s lives and homes and cities — fair false words\!  
Oh, why speak things to please our ears? We crave  
Not that ’Tis honour, honour, we must save\!

 

NURSE  
Why prate so proud\! ’Tis no words, brave nor base,  
Thou cravest; ’tis a man’s arms\!  \[PHAEDRA *moves indignantly.*  
                     Up and face  
The truth of what thou art, and name it straight\!  
Were not thy life thrown open here for Fate  
To beat on; hadst thou been a woman pure  
Or wise or strong; never had I for lure  
Of joy nor heartache led thee on to this\!  
But when a whole life one great battle is,  
To win or lose — no man can blame me then.

 

PHAEDRA  
Shame on thee\! Lock those lips, and ne’er again  
Let word nor thought so foul have harbour there\!

 

NURSE  
Foul, if thou wilt: but better than the fair  
For thee and me. And better, too, the deed  
Behind them, if it save thee in thy need,  
Than that word Honour thou wilt die to win\!

 

PHAEDRA  
Nay, in God’s name, — such wisdom and such sin  
Are all about thy lips\! — urge me no more.  
For all the soul within me is wrought o’er  
By Love; and if thou speak and speak, I may  
Be spent, and drift where now I shrink away.

 

NURSE  
Well, if thou wilt\!— ‘Twere best never to err,  
But, having erred, to take a counsellor  
Is second. — Mark me now. I have within  
Love-philtres, to make peace where storm hath been,  
That, with no shame, no scathe of mind, shall save  
Thy life from anguish; wilt but thou be brave\!  \[*To herself, reflecting.*  
Ah, but from him, the well-beloved, some sign  
We need, or word, or raiment’s hem, to twine  
Amid the charm, and one spell knit from twain.

 

PHAEDRA  
Is it a potion or a salve? Be plain.

 

NURSE  
Who knows? Seek to be helped, Child, not to know.

 

PHAEDRA  
Why art thou ever subtle? I dread thee, so.

 

NURSE  
Thou wouldst dread everything\! — What dost thou dread?

 

PHAEDRA  
Least to his ear some word be whispered.

 

NURSE  
Let be, Child\! I will make all well with thee\!  
 — Only do thou, O Cyprian of the Sea,  
Be with me\! And mine own heart, come what may,  
Shall know what ear to seek, what word to say\!  \[*The* NURSE, *having spoken these last words in prayer apart to the Statue of* CYPRIS, *turns back and goes into the house.* PHAEDRA *sits pensive again on her couch till towards the end of the following Song, when she rises and bends close to the door.*

 

CHORUS  
    Erôs, Erôs, who blindest, tear by tear,  
Men’s eyes with hunger; thou swift Foe, that pliest  
Deep in our hearts joy like an edgèd spear;  
Come not to me with Evil haunting near,  
Wrath on the wind, nor jarring of the clear  
Wing’s music as thou fliest\!  
There is no shaft that burneth, not in fire,  
Not in wild stars, far off and flinging fear,  
As in thine hands the shaft of All Desire,  
Erôs, Child of the Highest  
In vain, in vain, by old Alpheüs’ shore  
The blood of many bulls doth stain the river,  
And all Greece bows on Phœbus’ Pythian floor;  
Yet bring we to the Master of Man no store,  
The Keybearer, who standeth at the door  
Close-barred, where hideth ever  
The heart of the shrine. Yea, though he sack man’s life  
Like a sacked city, and moveth evermore  
Girt with calamity and strange ways of strife,  
Him have we worshipped never\!  
 ——  ——  ——   
   There roamed a Steed in Oechalia’s wild,

 

A Maid without yoke, without Master,  
And Love she knew not, that far King’s child;  
But he came, he came, with a song in the night,  
With fire, with blood; and she strove in flight,

 

A Torrent Spirit, a Maenad white,  
Faster and vainly faster,  
Sealed unto Heracles by the Cyprian’s Might.  
Alas, thou Bride of Disaster\!

 

O Mouth of Dirce, O god-built wall,  
That Dirce’s wells run under,  
Ye know the Cyprian’s fleet footfall\!  
Ye saw the heavens around her flare,  
When she lulled to her sleep that Mother fair  
Of Twy-born Bacchus, and decked her there  
The Bride of the bladed Thunder.  
For her breath is on all that hath life, and she floats in the air,  
Bee-like, death-like, a wonder.  \[*During the last lines* PHAEDRA *has approached the door and is listening.*

 

PHAEDRA  
Silence ye Women\! Something is amiss.

 

LEADER  
How? In the house? — Phædra, what fear is this?

 

PHAEDRA  
Let me but listen\! There are voices. Hark\!

 

LEADER  
I hold my peace: yet is thy presage dark.

 

PHAEDRA  
        Oh, misery\!

 

O God, that such a thing should fall on me\!

 

LEADER  
        What sound, what word,

 

O Women, Friend, makes that sharp terror start  
Out at thy lips? What ominous cry half-heard  
Hath leapt upon thine heart?

 

PHAEDRA  
I am undone\! — Bend to the door and hark,  
Hark what a tone sounds there, and sinks away\!

 

LEADER  
Thou art beside the bars. ’Tis thine to mark  
The castle’s floating message. Say, Oh, say  
What thing hath come to thee?

 

PHAEDRA \(*calmly*\)  
    Why, what thing should it be?  
The son of that proud Amazon speaks again  
In bitter wrath: speaks to my handmaiden\!

 

LEADER  
I hear a noise of voices, nothing clear.  
For thee the din bath words. as through barred locks  
Floating, at thy heart it knocks.

 

PHAEDRA  
“Pander of Sin” it says. — Now canst thou hear? —   
And there: “Betrayer of a master’s bed.”

 

LEADER  
      Ah me, betrayed\! Betrayed\!  
Sweet Princess, thou art ill bested,  
Thy secret brought to light, and ruin near,  
By her thou heldest dear,  
By her that should have loved thee and obeyed\!

 

PHAEDRA  
Aye, I am slain. She thought to help my fall  
With love instead of honour, and wrecked all.

 

LEADER  
      Where wilt thou turn thee, where?  
And what help seek, O wounded to despair?

 

PHAEDRA  
I know not, save one thing to die right soon.  
For such as me God keeps no other boon.  
*The door in the centre bursts open, and* HIPPOLYTUS *comes forth, closely followed by the* NURSE. PHAEDRA *cowers aside.*

 

HIPPOLYTUS

 

O Mother Earth, O Sun that makest clean,  
What poison have I heard, what speechless sin\!

 

NURSE  
Hush, O my Prince, lest others mark, and guess…

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
I have heard horrors\! Shall I hold my peace?

 

NURSE  
Yea, by this fair right arm, Son, by thy pledge…

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Down with that hand\! Touch not my garment’s edge\!

 

NURSE  
Oh, by thy knees, be silent or I die\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Why, when thy speech was all so guiltless? Why?

 

NURSE  
It is not meet, fair Son, for every ear\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Good words can bravely forth, and have no fear.

 

NURSE  
Thine oath, thine oath\! I took thine oath before\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
’Twas but my tongue, ’twas not my soul that swore.

 

NURSE

 

O Son, what wilt thou? Wilt thou slay thy kin?

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
I own no kindred with the spawn of sin\!  \[*He flings her from him.*

 

NURSE  
Nay, spare me\! Man was born to err; oh, spare\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS

 

O God, why hast Thou made this gleaming snare,  
Woman, to dog us on the happy earth?  
Was it Thy will to make Man, why his birth  
Through Love and Woman? Could we not have rolled  
Our store of prayer and offering, royal gold,  
Silver and weight of bronze before Thy feet,  
And bought of God new child souls, as were meet  
For each man’s sacrifice, and dwelt in homes  
Free, where nor Love nor Woman goes and comes?  
How, is that daughter not a bane confessed,  
Whom her own sire sends forth — \(He knows her best\!\) —   
And, will some man but take her, pays a dower\!  
And he, poor fool, takes home the poison-flower;  
Laughs to hang jewels on the deadly thing  
He joys in; labours for her robe-wearing,  
Till wealth and peace are dead. He smarts the less  
In whose high seat is set a Nothingness,  
A woman naught availing Worst of all  
The wise deep-thoughted\! Never in my hall  
May she sit throned who thinks and waits and sighs\!  
For Cypris breeds most evil in the wise,  
And least in her whose heart has naught within;  
For puny wit can work but puny sin.  
Why do we let their handmaids pass the gate?  
Wild beasts were best, voiceless and fanged, to wait  
About their rooms, that they might speak with none,  
Nor ever hear one answering human tone\!  
But now dark women in still chambers lay  
Plans that creep out into light of day  
On handmaids’ lips — \[*Turning to the* NURSE.  
       As thine accursèd head  
Braved the high honour of my Father’s bed,  
And came to traffic…. Our white torrent’s spray  
Shall drench mine ears to wash those words away\!  
And couldst thou dream that *I*…? I feel impure  
Still at the very hearing\! Know for sure,  
Woman, naught but mine honour saves ye both.  
Hadst thou not trapped me with that guileful oath,  
No power had held me secret till the King  
Knew all\! But now, while he is journeying,  
I too will go my ways and make no sound.  
And when he comes again, I shall be found  
Beside him, silent, watching with what grace  
Thou and thy mistress shall greet him face to face\!  
Then shall I have the taste of it, and know  
What woman’s guile is. — Woe upon you, woe\!  
How can I too much hate you, while the ill  
Ye work upon the world grows deadlier still?  
Too much? Make woman pure, and wild Love tame,  
Or let me cry for ever on their shame\!  \[*He goes off in fury to the left.* PHAEDRA *still cowering in her place begins to sob.*

 

PHAEDRA  
    Sad, sad and evil-starred  
Is Woman’s state.  
What shelter now is left or guard?  
What spell to loose the iron knot of fate?  
And this thing, O my God,  
O thou sweet Sunlight, is but my desert\!  
I cannot fly before the avenging rod  
Falls, cannot hide my hurt.  
What help, O ye who love me, can come near,  
What god or man appear,  
To aid a thing so evil and so lost?  
Lost, for this anguish presses, soon or late,  
To that swift river that no life hath cross.  
No woman ever lived so desolate\!

 

LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
Ah me, the time for deeds is gone; the boast  
Proved vain that spake thine handmaid; and all lost\!  \[*At these words* PHAEDRA *suddenly remembers* *the* NURSE, *who is cowering silently where* HIPPOLYTUS *had thrown her from him. She turns upon her.*

 

PHAEDRA  
O wicked, wicked, wicked\! Murderess heart  
To them that loved thee\! Hast thou played thy part?  
Am I enough trod down?  
           May Zeus, my sire,  
Blast and uproot thee Stab thee dead with fire\!  
Said I not — Knew I not thine heart? — to name  
To no one soul this that is now my shame?  
And thou couldst not be silent\! So no more  
I die in honour. But enough; a store  
Of new words must be spoke and new things thought,  
This man’s whole being to one blade is wrought  
Of rage against me. Even now he speeds  
To abase me to the King with thy misdeeds;  
Tell Pittheus; fill the land with talk of sin\!  
Cursèd be thou, and whoso else leaps in  
To bring bad aid to friends that want it not.  \[*The* NURSE *has raised herself, and faces* PHAEDRA, *downcast but calm.*

 

NURSE  
Mistress, thou blamest me; and all thy lot  
So bitter sore is, and the sting so wild,  
I bear with all. Yet, if I would, my Child,  
I have mine answer, couldst thou hearken aught.  
I nursed thee, and I love thee; and I sought  
Only some balm to heal thy deep despair,  
And found — not what I sought for. Else I were  
Wise, and thy friend, and good, had all sped right.  
So fares it with us all in the world’s sight.

 

PHAEDRA  
First stab me to the heart, then humour me  
With words\! ’Tis fair; ’tis all as it should be\!

 

NURSE  
We talk too long, Child. I did ill; but, oh,  
There is a way to save thee, even so\!

 

PHAEDRA  
A way? No more ways\! One way hast thou trod  
Already, foul and false and loathed of god\!  
Begone out of my sight; and ponder how  
Thine own life stands\! I need no helpers now.  \[*She turns from the* NURSE, *who creeps abashed away into the Castle.*  
Only do ye, high Daughters of Trozên,  
Let all ye hear be as it had not been;  
Know naught, and speak of naught\! ’Tis my last prayer.

 

LEADER  
By God’s pure daughter, Artemis, I swear,  
No word will I of these thy griefs reveal\!

 

PHAEDRA  
’Tis well. But now, yea, even while I reel  
And falter, one poor hope, as hope now is,  
I clutch at in this coil of miseries;  
To save some honour for my children’s sake;  
Yea, for myself some fragment, though things break  
In ruin around me. Nay, I will not shame  
The old proud Cretan Castle whence I came,  
I will not cower before King Theseus’ eyes,  
Abased, for want of one life’s sacrifice\!

 

LEADER  
What wilt thou? Some dire deed beyond recall?

 

PHAEDRA \(*musing*\)  
Die; but how die?

 

LEADER  
Let not such wild words fall\!

 

PHAEDRA \(*turning upon her*\)  
Give thou not such light counsel\! Let me be  
To sate the Cyprian that is murdering me\!  
To-day shall be her day; and, all strife past,  
Her bitter Love shall quell me at the last.  
Yet, dying, shall I die another’s bane\!  
He shall not stand so proud where I have lain  
Bent in the dust\! Oh, he shall stoop to share  
The life I live in, and learn mercy there\!  \[*She goes off wildly into the Castle.*

 

CHORUS  
Could I take me to some cavern for mine hiding,  
In the hill-tops where the Sun scarce hath trod;  
Or a cloud make the home of mine abiding,  
As a bird among the bird-droves of God\!  
Could I wing me to my rest amid the roar  
Of the deep Adriatic on the shore,  
Where the waters of Eridanus are clear,  
And Phaëthon’s sad sisters by his grave  
Weep into the river, and each tear  
Gleams, a drop of amber, in the wave.  
To the strand of the Daughters of the Sunset,  
The Apple-tree, the singing and the gold;  
Where the mariner must stay him from his onset,  
And the red wave is tranquil as of old;  
Yea, beyond that Pillar of the End  
That Atlas guardeth, would I wend;  
Where a voice of living waters never ceaseth  
In God’s quiet garden by the sea,  
And Earth, the ancient life-giver, increaseth  
Joy among the meadows, like a tree.  
 ——  ——  ——   
O shallop of Crete, whose milk-white wing  
Through the swell and the storm-beating,  
Bore us thy Prince’s daughter,  
Was it well she came from a joyous home  
To a far King’s bridal across the foam?  
What joy hath her bridal brought her?  
Sure some spell upon either hand  
Flew with thee from the Cretan strand,  
Seeking Athena’s tower divine;  
And there, where Munychus fronts the brine,  
Crept by the shore-flung cables’ line,  
The curse from the Cretan water\!  
And, for that dark spell that about her clings,  
Sick desires of forbidden things  
The soul of her rend and sever;  
The bitter tide of calamity  
Hath risen above her lips; and she,  
Where bends she her last endeavour?  
She will hie her alone to her bridal room,  
And a rope swing slow in the rafters’ gloom;  
And a fair white neck shall creep to the noose,  
A-shudder with dread, yet firm to choose  
The one strait way for fame, and lose  
The Love and the pain for ever.  \[*The Voice of the* NURSE *is heard from within, crying, at first inarticulately, then clearly.*

 

VOICE  
Help ho\! The Queen\! Help, whoso hearkeneth\!  
Help\! Theseus’ spouse caught in a noose of death\!

 

A WOMAN  
God, is it so soon finished? That bright head  
Swinging beneath the rafters\! Phædra dead\!

 

VOICE  
O haste\! This knot about her throat is made  
So fast\! Will no one bring me a swift blade?

 

A WOMAN  
Say, friends, what think ye? Should we haste within,  
And from her own hand’s knotting loose the Queen?

 

ANOTHER  
Nay, are there not men there? ’Tis an ill road  
In life, to finger at another’s load.

 

VOICE  
Let it lie straight\! Alas\! the cold white thing  
That guards his empty caste for the King\!

 

A WOMAN  
Ah\! “Let it lie straight\!” Heard ye what she said?  
No need for helpers now; the Queen is dead\!  \[*The Women, intent upon the voices from the Castle, have not noticed the approach of* THESEUS. *He enters from the left; his dress and the garland on his head show that he has returned from some oracle or special abode of a God. He stands for a moment perplexed.*

 

THESEUS  
Ho, Women, and what means this loud acclaim  
Within the house? The vassals’ outcry came  
To smite mine ears far off. It were more meet  
To fling out wide the Castle gates, and greet  
With a joy held from God’s Presence\!  \[*The confusion and horror of the Women’s faces gradually affects him. A dirge-cry comes from the Castle.*  
                         How?  
Not Pittheus? Hath Time struck that hoary brow?  
Old is he, old, I know. But sore it were,  
Returning thus, to find his empty chair\!  \[*The Women hesitate; then the Leader comes forward.*

 

LEADER

 

O Theseus, not on any old man’s head  
This stroke falls. Young and tender is the dead.

 

THESEUS  
Ye Gods\! One of my children torn from me?

 

LEADER  
Thy motherless children live, most grievously

 

THESEUS  
How sayst thou? What? My wife?…  
Say how she died.

 

LEADER  
In a high death-knot that her own hands tied.

 

THESEUS  
A fit of the old cold auguish — Tell me all —   
That held her? Or did some fresh thing befall?

 

LEADER  
We know no more. But now arrived we be,  
Theseus, to mourn for thy calamity.  \[THESEUS *stays for a moment silent, and puts his hand on his brow. He notices the wreath.*

 

THESEUS  
What? And all garlanded I come to her  
With flowers, most evil-starred God’s-messenger\!  
Ho, varlets, loose the porral bars; undo  
The bolts; and let me see the bitter view  
Of her whose death bath brought me to mine own.  \[*The great central door of the Castle is thrown open wide, and the body of* PHAEDRA *is seen lying on a bier, surrounded by a group of Handmaids, wailing.*

 

THE HANDMAIDS  
Ah me, what thou hast suffered and hast done:  
A deed to wrap this roof in flame\!  
Why was thine hand so strong, thine heart so bold?  
Wherefore, O dead in anger, dead in shame,  
The long, long wrestling ere thy breath was cold?  
O ill-starred Wife,  
What brought this blackness over all thy life?  \[*A throng of Men and Women has gradually collected.*

 

THESEUS  
        Ah me, this is the last  
 — Hear, O my countrymen\! — and bitterest  
Of Theseus’ labours\! Fortune all unblest,  
How hath thine heavy heel across me passed\!  
Is it the stain of sins done long ago,  
Some fell God still remembereth,  
That must so dim and fret my life with death?  
I cannot win to shore; and the waves flow  
Above mine eyes, to be surmounted not.  
Ah wife, sweet wife, what name  
Can fit thine heavy lot?  
Gone like a wild bird, like a blowing flame,  
In one swift gust, where all things are forgot\!  
Alas\! this misery\!  
Sure ’tis some stroke of God’s great anger rolled  
From age to age on me,  
For some dire sin wrought by dim kings of old.

 

LEADER  
Sire, this great grief bath come to many an one,  
A true wife lost. Thou art not all alone.

 

THESEUS  
        Deep, deep beneath the Earth,  
Dark may my dwelling be,  
And night my heart’s one comrade, in the dearth,

 

O Love, of thy most sweet society.  
This is my death, O Phædra, more than thine.  \[*He turns suddenly on the Attendants.*  
Speak who speak can\! What was it? What malign  
Swift stroke, O heart discounselled, leapt on thee?  \[*He bends over* PHAEDRA; *then, as no one speaks, looks fiercely up.*  
What, will ye speak? Or are they dumb as death,  
This herd of thralls, my high house harboureth?  \[*There is no answer. He bends again over* PHAEDRA.  
Ah me, why shouldst thou die?  
A wide and royal grief I here behold,  
Not to be borne in peace, not to be told.  
As a lost man am I.  
My children motherless and my house undone,  
Since thou art vanished quite,  
Purest of hearts that e’er the wandering Sun  
Touched, or the star-eyed splendour of the Night.  \[*He throws himself beside the body.*

 

CHORUS  
Unhappy one, O most unhappy one;  
With what strange evil is this Castle vexed\!  
Mine eyes are molten with the tears that run  
For thee and thine; but what thing follows next?  
I tremble when I think thereon\!\[*They have noticed that there is a tablet with writing fastened to the dead woman’s wrist.* THESEUS *also sees it.*

 

THESEUS  
Ha, what is this that hangs from her dear hand?  
A tablet\! It would make me understand  
Some dying wish, some charge about her bed  
And children. ’Twas the last prayer, ere her head  
Was bowed for ever.  \[*Taking the tablet.*  
       Fear not, my lost bride,  
No woman born shall lie at Theseus’ side,  
Nor rule in Theseus’ house\!  
               A seal\! Ah, see  
How her gold signet here looks up at me,  
Trustfully. Let me tear this thread away,  
And read what tale the tablet seeks to say.  \[*He proceeds to undo and read the tablet. The Chorus breaks into horrified groups.*

 

SOME WOMEN  
        Woe, woe\! God brings to birth  
A new grief here, close on the other’s tread\!  
My life bath lost its worth.  
May all go now with what is finishèd\!  
The castle of my King is overthrown,  
A house no more, a house vanished and gone\!

 

OTHER WOMEN

 

O God, if it may be in any way,  
Let not this house he wrecked\! Help us who pray\!  
I know not what is here: some unseen thing  
That shows the Bird of Evil on the wing.  \[THESEUS *has read the tablet and breaks out in uncontrollable emotion.*

 

THESEUS  
Oh, horror piled on horror\! — Here is writ…  
Nay, who could hear it, who could speak of it?

 

LEADER  
What, O my King? If I may hear it, speak\!

 

THESEUS  
Doth not the tablet cry aloud, yea, shriek,  
Things not to he forgotten? — Oh, to fly  
And hide mine head\! No more a man am I.  
God what ghastly music echoes here\!

 

LEADER  
How wild thy voice\! Some terrible thing is near.

 

THESEUS  
No; my lips’ gates will hold it back no more:  
This deadly word,  
That struggles on the brink and will not o’er,  
Yet will not stay unheard.  \[*He raises his hand, to make proclamation to all present.*  
Ho, hearken all this land\!  \[*The people gather expectantly about him.*  
Hippolytus by violence bath laid hand  
On this my wife, forgetting God’s great eye.  \[*Murmurs of amazement and horror;* THESEUS, *apparently calm, raises both arms to heaven.*  
Therefore, O Thou my Father, hear my cry,  
Poseidon\! Thou didst grant me for mine own  
Three prayers; for one of these, slay now my son,  
Hippolytus; let him not outlive this day,  
If true thy promise was\! Lo, thus I pray.

 

LEADER  
Oh, call that wild prayer back\! O King, take heed\!  
I know that thou wilt live to rue this deed.

 

THESEUS  
It may not be. — And more, I cast him out  
From all my realms. He shall be held about  
By two great dooms. Or by Poseidon’s breath  
He shall fall swiftly to the house of Death;  
Or wandering, outcast, o’er strange land and sea,  
Shall live and drain the cup of misery.

 

LEADER  
Ah, see\! here comes he at the point of need.  
Shake off that evil mood, O King; have heed  
For all thine house and folk. — Great Theseus, hear\!  \[THESEUS *stands silent in fierce gloom.* HIPPOLYTUS *comes in from the right.*

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Father, I heard thy cry, and sped in fear  
To help thee. — But I see not yet the cause  
That racked thee so. — Say, Father, what it was.  \[*The murmurs in the crowd, the silent gloom of his Father, and the horror of the Chorus-women gradually work on* HIPPOLYTUS *and bewilder him. He catches sight of the bier.*  
Ah, what is that\! Nay, Father, not the Queen  
Dead\!  \[*Murmurs in the crowd.*  
’Tis most strange. ’Tis passing strange, I ween.  
’Twas here I left her. Scarce an hour hath run  
Since here she stood and looked on this same sun.  
What is it with her? Wherefore did she die?  \[THESEUS remains silent. The murmurs increase.  
Father, to thee I speak. Oh, tell me, why,  
Why art thou silent? What doth silence know  
Of skill to stem the bitter flood of woe?  
And human hearts in sorrow crave the more,  
For knowledge, though the knowledge grieve them sore  
It is not love, to veil thy sorrows in  
From one most near to thee, and more than kin.

 

THESEUS \(*to himself*\)  
Fond race of men, so striving and so blind,  
Ten thousand arts and wisdoms can ye find,  
Desiring all and all imagining:  
But ne’er have reached nor understood one thing,  
To make a true heart there where no heart is\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
That were indeed beyond man’s mysteries,  
To make a false heart true against his will.  
But why this subtle talk? It likes me ill,  
Father; thy speech runs wild beneath this blow.

 

THESEUS \(*as before*\)  
O would that God had given us here below  
Some test of love, some sifting of the soul,  
To tell the false and true\! Or through the whole  
Of men two voices ran, one true and right,  
The other as chance willed it; that we might  
Convict the liar by the true man’s tone,  
And not live duped forever, every one\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS \(*misunderstanding him; then guessing at something of the truth*\)  
What? Hath some friend proved false?  
                         Or in thine ear  
Whispered some slander? Stand I tainted here,  
Though utterly innocent?  \[*Murmurs from the crowd.*  
           Yea, dazed am I;  
’Tis thy words daze me, falling all awry,  
Away from reason, by fell fancies vexed\!

 

THESEUS  
O heart of man, what height wilt venture next?  
What end comes. to thy daring and thy crime?  
For if with each man’s life ‘twill higher climb,  
And every age break out in blood and lies  
Beyond its fathers, must not God devise  
Some new world far from ours, to hold therein  
Such brood of all unfaithfulness and sin?  
Look, all, upon this man, my son, his life  
Sprung forth from mine\! He hath defiled my wife;  
And standeth here convicted by the dead,  
A most black villain\!  \[HIPPOLYTUS *falls back with a cry and covers his face with his robe.*  
         Nay, hide not thine head\!  
Pollution, is it? Thee it will not stain.  
Look up, and face thy Father’s eyes again\!  
Thou friend of Gods, of all mankind elect;  
Thou the pure heart, by thoughts of ill unflecked\!  
I care not for thy boasts. I am not mad,  
To deem that Gods love best the base and bad,  
Now is thy day\! Now vaunt thee; thou so pure,  
No flesh of life may pass thy lips\! Now lure  
Fools after thee; call Orpheus King and Lord;  
Make ecstasies and wonders Thumb thine hoard  
Of ancient scrolls and ghostly mysteries —   
Now thou art caught and known\!  
                   Shun men like these,  
I charge ye all\! With solemn words they chase  
Their prey, and in their hearts plot foul disgrace.  
My wife is dead.— “Ha, so that saves thee now,”  
That is what grips thee worst, thou caitiff, thou\!  
What oaths, what subtle words, shall stronger be  
Than this dead hand, to clear the guilt from thee?  
“She hated thee,” thou sayest; “the bastard born  
Is ever sore and bitter as a thorn  
To the true brood.” — A sorry bargainer  
In the ills and goods of life thou makest her,  
If all her best-beloved she cast away  
To wreck blind hate on thee\! — What, wilt thou say,  
“Through every woman’s nature one blind strand  
Of passion winds, that men scarce understand?” —   
Are we so different? Know I not the fire  
And perilous flood of a young man’s desire,  
Desperate as any woman, and as blind,  
When Cypris stings? Save that the man behind  
Has all men’s strength to aid him. Nay, ’twas thou…  
But what avail to wrangle with thee now,  
When the dead speaks for all to understand,  
A perfect witness\!  
       Hie thee from this land  
To exile with all speed. Come never more  
To god-built Athens, not to the utmost shore  
Of any realm where Theseus’ arm is strong\!  
What? Shall I bow my head beneath this wrong,  
And cower to thee? Not Isthmian Sinis so  
Will bear men witness that I laid him low,  
Nor Skiron’s rocks, that share the salt sea’s prey,  
Grant that my hand bath weight vile things to slay\!

 

LEADER  
Alas\! whom shall I call of mortal men  
Happy? The highest are cast down again.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Father, the hot strained fury of thy heart  
Is terrible. Yet, albeit so swift thou art  
Of speech, if all this matter were laid bare,  
Speech were not then so swift; nay, nor so fair….  \[*Murmurs again in the crowd.*  
I have no skill before a crowd to tell  
My thoughts. ‘Twere best with few, that know me well. —   
Nay, that is natural; tongues that sound but rude  
In wise men’s ears, speak to the multitude  
With music.  
None the less, since there is come  
This stroke upon me, I must not be dumb,  
But speak perforce…. And there will I begin  
Where thou beganst, as though to strip my sin  
Naked, and I not speak a word\!  
                   Dost see  
This sunlight and this earth? I swear to thee  
There dwelleth not in these one man — deny  
All that thou wilt\! — more pure of sin than I.  
Two things I know on earth: God’s worship first;  
Next to win friends about me, few, that thirst  
To hold them clean of all unrighteousness.  
Our rule doth curse the tempters, and no less  
Who yieldeth to the tempters. — How, thou say’st,  
“Dupes that I jest at?” Nay; I make a jest  
Of no man. I am honest to the end,  
Near or far off, with him I call my friend.  
And most in that one thing, where now thy mesh  
Would grip me, stainless quite\! No woman’s flesh  
Hath e’er this body touched. Of all such deed  
Naught wot I, save what things a man may read  
In pictures or hear spoke; nor am I fain,  
Being virgin-souled, to read or hear again.  
My life of innocence moves thee not; so be it.  
Show then what hath seduced me; let me see it.  
Was that poor flesh so passing fair, beyond  
All woman’s loveliness?  
           Was I some fond  
False plotter, that I schemed to win through her  
Thy castle’s heirdom? Fond indeed I were\!  
Nay, a stark madman\! “But a crown,” thou sayest,  
“Usurped, is sweet.” Nay, rather most unblest  
To all wise-hearted; sweet to fools and them  
Whose eyes are blinded by the diadem.  
In contests of all valour fain would I  
Lead Hellas; but in rank and majesty  
Not lead, but be at ease, with good men near  
To love me, free to work and not to fear.  
That brings more joy than any crown or throne.  \[*He sees from the demeanor of* THESEUS *and of the crowd that his words are not winning them, but rather making them bitterer than before. It comes to his lips to speak the whole truth.*  
I have said my say; save one thing. one alone.  
O had I here some witness in my need,  
As I was witness\! Could she hear me plead,  
Face me and face the sunlight; well I know,  
Our deeds would search us out for thee, and show  
Who lies\!  
But now, I swear — so hear me both,  
The Earth beneath and Zeus who Guards the Oath —   
I never touched this woman that was thine\!  
No words could win me to it, nor incline  
My heart to dream it. May God strike me down,  
Nameless and fameless, without home or town,  
An outcast and a wanderer of the world;  
May my dead bones rest never, but be hurled  
From sea to land, from land to angry sea,  
If evil is my heart and false to thee\!  \[*He waits a moment; but sees that his Father is unmoved. The truth again comes to his lips.*  
If ’twas some fear that made her cast away  
Her life … I know not. More I must not say.  
Right hath she done when in her was no right;  
And Right I follow to mine own despite\!

 

LEADER  
It is enough\! God’s name is witness large,  
And thy great oath, to assoil thee of this charge.

 

THESEUS  
Is not the man a juggler and a mage,  
Cool wits and one right oath — what more? — to assuage  
Sin and the wrath of injured fatherhood\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Am I so cool? Nay, Father, ’tis thy mood  
That makes me marvel\! By my faith, wert thou  
The son, and I the sire; and deemed I now  
In very truth thou hadst my wife assailed,  
I had not exiled thee, nor stood and railed,  
But lifted once mine arm, and struck thee dead\!

 

THESEUS  
Thou gentle judge\! Thou shalt not so be sped  
To simple death, nor by thine own decree.  
Swift death is bliss to men in misery.  
Far off, friendless forever, thou shalt drain  
Amid strange cities the last dregs of pain\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Wilt verily cast me now beyond thy pale,  
Not wait for Time, the lifter of the veil?

 

THESEUS  
Aye, if I could past Pontus, and the red  
Atlantic marge\! So do I hate thine head.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Wilt weigh nor oath nor faith nor prophet’s word  
To prove me? Drive me from thy sight unheard?

 

THESEUS  
This tablet here, that needs no prophet’s lot  
To speak from, tells me all. I ponder not  
Thy fowls that fly above us\! Let them fly.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
O ye great Gods, wherefore unlock not I  
My lips, ere yet ye have slain me utterly,  
Ye whom I love most? No. It may not be\!  
The one heart that I need I ne’er should gain  
To trust me. I should break mine oath in vain.

 

THESEUS  
Death\! but he chokes me with his saintly tone\! —   
Up, get thee from this land\! Begone\! Begone\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Where shall I turn me? Think. To what friend’s door  
Betake me, banished on a charge so sore?

 

THESEUS  
Whoso delights to welcome to his hall  
Vile ravishers … to guard his hearth withal\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Thou seekst my heart, my tears? Aye, let it be  
Thus\! I am vile to all men, and to thee\!

 

THESEUS  
There was a time for tears and thought; the time  
Ere thou didst up and gird thee to thy crime.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Ye stones, will ye not speak? Ye castle walls\!  
Bear witness if I be so vile, so false\!

 

THESEUS  
Aye, fly to voiceless witnesses\! Yet here  
A dumb deed speaks against thee, and speaks clear\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Alas\!  
Would I could stand and watch this thing, and see  
My face, and weep for very pity of me\!

 

THESEUS  
Full of thyself, as ever\! Not a thought  
For them that gave thee birth; nay, they are naught\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
O my wronged Mother\! O my birth of shame\!  
May none I love e’er bear a bastard’s name\!

 

THESEUS \(*in a sudden blaze of rage*\)  
Up, thralls, and drag him from my presence\! What,  
’Tis but a foreign felon\! Heard ye not?  \[*The thralls still hesitate in spite of his fury.*

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
They touch me at their peril\! Thine own hand  
Lift, if thou canst, to drive me from the land.

 

THESEUS  
That will I straight, unless my will be done\!  \[HIPPOLYTUS *comes close to him and kneels.*  
Nay\! Not for thee my pity\! Get thee gone\!  \[HIPPOLYTUS *rises, makes a sign of submission, and slowly moves away.* THESEUS, *as soon as he sees him going, turns rapidly and enters the Castle. The door is closed again.* HIPPOLYTUS *has stopped for a moment before the Statue of* ARTEMIS, *and, as* THESEUS *departs, breaks out in prayer.*

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
So; it is done\! O dark and miserable\!  
I see it all, but see not how to tell  
The tale. — O thou belovèd, Leto’s Maid,  
Chase-comrade, fellow-rester in the glade,  
Lo, I am driven with a caitiff’s brand  
Forth from great Athens\! Fare ye well, O land  
And city of old Erechtheus\! Thou, Trozên,  
What riches of glad youth mine eyes have seen  
In thy broad plain\! Farewell\! This is the end;  
The last word, the last look\!  
                 Come, every friend  
And fellow of my youth that still may stay,  
Give me god-speed and cheer me on my way.  
Ne’er shall ye see a man more pure of spot  
Than me, though mine own Father loves me not\!  \[HIPPOLYTUS *goes away to the right, followed by many Huntsmen and other young men. The rest of the crowd has by this time dispersed, except the Women of the Chorus and some Men of the Chorus of Huntsmen.*

 

CHORUS  
*Men*  
Surely the thought of the Gods hath balm in it alway, to win me  
Far from my griefs; and a thought, deep in the dark of my mind,  
Clings to a great Understanding. Yet all the spirit within me  
Faints, when I watch men’s deeds matched with the guerdon they find.  
For Good comes in Evil’s traces,  
And the Evil the Good replaces;  
And Life, ‘mid the changing faces,  
 Wandereth weak and blind.  
*Women*  
What wilt thou grant me, O God? Lo, this is the prayer of my travail —   
Some well-being; and chance not very bitter thereby;

 

A Spirit uncrippled by pain; and a mind not deep to unravel  
Truth unseen, nor yet dark with the brand of a lie.  
With a veering mood to borrow  
Its light from every morrow,  
Fair friends and no deep sorrow,  
 Well could man live and die\!  
*Men*  
  Yet my spirit is no more clean,  
And the weft of my hope is torn,  
For the deed of wrong that mine eyes have seen,  
The lie and the rage and the scorn;

 

A Star among men, yea, a Star  
That in Hellas was bright,  
By a Father’s wrath driven far  
To the wilds and the night.  
Oh, alas for the sands of the shore\!  
Alas for the brakes of the hill,  
Where the wolves shall fear thee no more,  
And thy cry to Dictynna is still\!  
*Women*  
  No more in the yoke of thy car  
Shall the colts of Enetia fleet;  
Nor Limna’s echoes quiver afar  
To the clatter of galloping feet.  
The sleepless music of old,  
That leaped in the lyre,  
Ceaseth now, and is cold,  
In the halls of thy sire.  
The bowers are discrowned and unladen  
Where Artemis lay on the lea;  
And the love-dream of many a maiden  
Lost, in the losing of thee.

 

*A Maiden*  
And I, even I,  
For thy fall, O Friend,  
Amid tears and tears,  
Endure to the end  
Of the empty years,  
Of a life run dry.  
In vain didst thou bear him,  
Thou Mother forlorn\!  
Ye Gods that did snare him,  
Lo, I cast in your faces  
My hate and my scorn\!  
Ye love-linkèd Graces,  
\(Alas for the day\!\)  
Was he naught, then, to you,  
That ye cast him away,  
The stainless and true,  
From the old happy places?

 

LEADER  
Look yonder\! ’Tis the Prince’s man, I ween,  
Speeding toward this gate, most dark of mien.  \[A HENCHMAN *enters in haste.*

 

HENCHMAN  
Ye women, whither shall I go to seek  
King Theseus? Is he in this dwelling? Speak\!

 

LEADER  
Lo, where he cometh through the Castle gate\!  \[THESEUS *comes out from the Castle.*

 

HENCHMAN

 

O King, I bear thee tidings of dire weight  
To thee, aye, and to every man, I ween,  
From Athens to the marches of Trozên.

 

THESEUS  
What? Some new stroke hath touched, unknown to me,  
The sister cities of my sovranty?

 

HENCHMAN  
Hippolytus is … Nay, not dead; hut stark  
Outstretched, a hairsbreadth this side of the dark.

 

THESEUS \(*as though unmoved*\)  
How slain? Was there some other man, whose wife  
He had like mine defiled, that sought his life?

 

HENCHMAN  
His own wild team destroyed him, and the dire  
Curse of thy lips.  
       The boon of thy great Sire  
Is granted thee, O King, and thy son slain.

 

THESEUS  
Ye Gods\! And thou, Poseidon\! Not in vain  
I called thee Father; thou hast heard my prayer\!  
How did he die? Speak on. How closed the snare  
Of Heaven to slay the shamer of my blood?

 

HENCHMAN  
’Twas by the bank of beating sea we stood,  
We thralls, and decked the steeds, and combed each mane;  
Weeping; for word had come that ne’er again  
The foot of our Hippolytus should roam  
This land, but waste in exile by thy doom.  
So stood we till he came, and in his tone  
No music now save sorrow’s, like our own,  
And in his train a concourse without end  
Of many a chase-fellow and many a friend.  
At last he brushed his sobs away, and spake:  
“Why this fond loitering? I would not break  
My Father’s law — Ho, there\! My coursers four  
And chariot, quick\! This land is mine no more.”  
Thereat, be sure, each man of us made speed.  
Swifter than speech we brought them up, each steed  
Well dight and shining, at our Prince’s side.  
He grasped the reins upon the rail: one stride  
And there he stood, a perfect charioteer,  
Each foot in its own station set. Then clear  
His voice rose, and his arms to heaven were spread:  
“O Zeus, if I be false, strike thou me dead\!  
But, dead or living, let my Father see  
One day, how falsely he hath hated me\!”  
Even as he spake, he lifted up the goad  
And smote; and the steeds sprang. And down the road  
We henchmen followed, hard beside the rein,  
Each hand, to speed him, toward the Argive plain  
And Epidaurus.  
   So we made our way  
Up toward the desert region, where the bay  
Curls to a promontory near the verge  
Of our Trozên, facing the southward surge  
Of Saron’s gulf. Just there an angry sound,  
Slow-swelling, like God’s thunder underground,  
Broke on us, and we trembled. And the steeds  
Pricked their ears skyward, and threw back their heads.  
And wonder came on all men, and affright,  
Whence rose that awful voice. And swift our sight  
Turned seaward, down the salt and roaring sand.  
And there, above the horizon, seemed to stand  
A wave unearthly, crested in the sky;  
Till Skiron’s Cape first vanished from mine eye,  
Then sank the Isthmus hidden, then the rock  
Of Epidaurus. Then it broke, one shock  
And roar of gasping sea and spray flung far,  
And shoreward swept, where stood the Prince’s car.  
Three lines of wave together raced, and, full  
In the white crest of them, a wild Sea-Bull  
Flung to the shore, a fell and marvellous Thing.  
The whole land held his voice, and answering  
Roared in each echo. And all we, gazing there,  
Gazed seeing not; ’twas more than eyes could bear.  
Then straight upon the team wild terror fell.  
Howbeit, the Prince, cool-eyed and knowing well  
Each changing mood a horse has, gripped the reins  
Hard in both hands; then as an oarsman strains  
Up from his bench, so strained he on the thong,  
Back in the chariot swinging. But the young  
Wild steeds bit hard the curb, and fled afar;  
Nor rein nor guiding hand nor morticed car  
Stayed them at all. For when he veered them round,  
And aimed their flying feet to grassy ground,  
In front uprose that Thing, and turned again  
The four great coursers, terror-mad. But when  
Their blind rage drove them toward the rocky places,  
Silent, and ever nearer to the traces,  
It followed rockward, till one wheel-edge grazed.  
The chariot tript and flew, and all was mazed  
In turmoil. Up went wheel-box with a din,  
Where the rock jagged, and nave and axle-pin.  
And there — the long reins round him — there was he  
Dragging, entangled irretrievably.  
A dear head battering at the chariot side,  
Sharp rocks, and rippled flesh, and a voice that cried:  
“Stay, stay, O ye who fattened at my stalls,  
Dash me not into nothing\! — O thou false  
Curse of my Father\! — Help\! Help, whoso can,  
An innocent, innocent and stainless man\!”  
Many there were that laboured then, I wot,  
To bear him succour, but could reach him not,  
Till — who knows how? — at last the tangled rein  
Unclasped him, and he fell, some little vein  
Of life still pulsing in him.  
                 All beside,  
The steeds, the hornèd Horror of the Tide,  
Had vanished — who knows where? — in that wild land.

 

O King, I am a bondsman of thine hand;  
Yet love nor fear nor duty me shall win  
To say thine innocent son bath died in sin.  
All women born may hang themselves, for me,  
And swing their dying words from every tree  
On Ida\! For I know that he was true\!

 

LEADER

 

O God, so cometh new disaster, new  
Despair\! And no escape from what must be\!

 

THESEUS  
Hate of the man thus stricken lifted me  
At first to joy at hearing of thy tale;  
But now, some shame before the Gods, some pale  
Pity for mine own blood, bath o’er me come.  
I laugh not, neither weep, at this fell doom.

 

HENCHMAN  
How then? Behoves it bear him here, or how  
Best do thy pleasure? — Speak, Lord. Yet if thou  
Wilt mark at all my word, thou wilt not be  
Fierce-hearted to thy child in misery.

 

THESEUS  
Aye, bring him hither. Let me see the face  
Of him who durst deny my deep disgrace  
And his own sin; yea, speak with him, and prove  
His clear guilt by God’s judgments from above.  \[*The* HENCHMAN *departs to fetch* HIPPOLYTUS; THESEUS *sits waiting in stern gloom, while the* CHORUS *sing. At the close of their song a Divine Figure is seen approaching on a cloud in the air and the voice of* ARTEMIS *speaks.*

 

CHORUS  
Thou comest to bend the pride  
Of the hearts of God and man,  
Cypris and by thy side,  
In earth-encircling span,  
He of the changing plumes,  
The Wing that the world illumes,  
As over the leagues of land flies he,  
Over the salt and sounding sea.  
For mad is the heart of Love,  
And gold the gleam of his wing;  
And all to the spell thereof  
Bend, when he makes his spring;  
All life that is wild and young  
In mountain and wave and stream,  
All that of earth is sprung,  
Or breathes in the red sunbeam;  
Yea, and Mankind. O’er all a royal throne,  
Cyprian, Cyprian, is thine alone\!

 

A VOICE FROM THE CLOUD  
    O thou that rulest in Aegeus’ Hall,  
I charge thee, hearken\!  
               Yea, it is I,  
Artemis, Virgin of God most High.  
Thou bitter King, art thou glad withal  
For thy murdered son?  
For thine ear bent low to a lying Queen,  
For thine heart so swift amid things unseen?  
Lo, all may see what end thou hast won\!  
Go, sink thine head in the waste abyss;  
Or aloft to another world than this,  
Birdwise with wings,  
Fly far to thine hiding,  
Far over this blood that clots and clings;  
For in righteous men and in holy things  
No rest is thine nor abiding\!  \[*The cloud has become stationary in the air.*  
Hear, Theseus, all the story of thy grief\!  
Verily, I bring but anguish, not relief;  
Yet, ’twas for this I came, to show how high  
And clean was thy son’s heart, that he may die  
Honoured of men; aye, and to tell no less  
The frenzy, or in some sort the nobleness,  
Of thy dead wife. One Spirit there is, whom we  
That know the joy of white virginity,  
Most hate in heaven. She sent her fire to run  
In Phædra’s veins, so that she loved thy son.  
Yet strove she long with love, and in the stress  
Fell not, till by her Nurse’s craftiness  
Betrayed, who stole, with oaths of secrecy,  
To entreat thy son. And he, most righteously,  
Nor did her will, nor, when thy railing scorn  
Beat on him, broke the oath that he had sworn,  
For God’s sake. And thy Phædra, panic-eyed,  
Wrote a false writ, and slew thy son, and died,  
Lying; but thou wast nimble to believe\!  \[THESEUS, *at first bewildered, then dumfounded, now utters a deep groan.*  
It stings thee, Theseus? — Nay, hear on, and grieve  
Yet sorer. Wottest thou three prayers were thine  
Of sure fulfilment, from thy Sire divine?  
Hast thou no foes about thee, then, that one —   
Thou vile King\! — must be turned against thy son?  
The deed was thine. Thy Sea-born Sire but heard  
The call of prayer, and bowed him to his word.  
But thou in his eyes and in mine art found  
Evil, who wouldst not think, nor probe, nor sound  
The deeps of prophet’s lore, nor day by day  
Leave Time to search; but, swifter than man may,  
Let loose the curse to slay thine innocent son\!

 

THESEUS

 

O Goddess, let me die\!

 

ARTEMIS  
                        Nay; thou hast done  
A heavy wrong; yet even beyond this ill  
Abides for thee forgiveness. ’Twas the will  
Of Cypris that these evil things should be,  
Sating her wrath. And this immutably  
Hath Zeus ordained in heaven no God may thwart

 

A God’s fixed will; we grieve but stand apart.  
Else, but for fear of the Great Father’s blame,  
Never had I to such extreme of shame  
Bowed me, be sure, as here to stand and see  
Slain him I loved best of mortality\!  
Thy fault, O King, its ignorance sunders wide  
From very wickedness; and she who died  
By death the more disarmed thee, making dumb  
The voice of question. And the storm has come  
Most bitterly of all on thee\! Yet I  
Have mine own sorrow, too. When good men die,  
There is no joy in heaven, albeit our ire  
On child and house of the evil falls like fire.  \[*A throng is seen approaching;* HIPPOLYTUS *enters, supported by his attendants.*

 

CHORUS  
    Lo, it is he\! The bright young head  
Yet upright there\!  
Ah, the torn flesh and the blood-stained hair;  
Alas for the kindred’s trouble\!  
It falls as fire from a God’s hand sped,  
Two deaths, and mourning double.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
    Ah, pain, pain, pain\!  
O unrighteous curse\! O unrighteous sire\!  
No hope. — My head is stabbed with fire,  
And a leaping spasm about my brain.  
Stay, let me rest. I can no more.  
O fell, fell steeds that my own hand fed,  
Have ye maimed me and slain, that loved me of yore?  
 — Soft there, ye thralls\! No trembling hands  
As ye lift me, now\! — Who is that that stands  
At the right? — Now firm, and with measured tread,  
Lift one accursèd and stricken sore  
By a father’s sinning.  
Thou, Zeus, dost see me? Yea, it is I;  
The proud and pure, the server of God,  
The white and shining in sanctity\!  
To a visible death, to an open sod,  
I walk my ways;  
And all the labour of saintly days  
Lost, lost, without meaning\!  
Ah God, it crawls  
This agony, over me\!  
Let be, ye thralls\!  
Come, Death, and cover me:  
Come, O thou Healer blest  
But a little more,  
And my soul is clear,  
And the anguish o’er\!  
Oh, a spear, a spear\!  
To rend my soul to its rest\!  
Oh, strange, false Curse\! Was there some blood-stained head,  
Some father of my line, unpunishèd,  
Whose guilt lived in his kin,  
And passed, and slept, till after this long day  
It lights…. Oh, why on me? Me, far away  
And innocent of sin?  
O words that cannot save\!  
When will this breathing end in that last deep  
Pain that is painlessness? ’Tis sleep I crave.  
When wilt thou bring me sleep,  
Thou dark and midnight magic of the grave\!

 

ARTEMIS  
Sore-stricken man, bethink thee in this stress,  
Thou dost but die for thine own nobleness.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Ah\!  
O breath of heavenly fragrance\! Though my pain  
Burns, I can feel thee and find rest again.  
The Goddess Artemis is with me here.

 

ARTEMIS  
With thee and loving thee, poor sufferer\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Dost see me, Mistress, nearing my last sleep?

 

ARTEMIS  
Aye, and would weep for thee, if Gods could weep.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Who now shall hunt with thee or hold thy quiver?

 

ARTEMIS  
He dies; but my love cleaves to him for ever.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Who guide thy chariot, keep thy shrine-flowers fresh?

 

ARTEMIS  
The accursed Cyprian caught him in her mesh\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
The Cyprian? Now I see it\! — Aye, ’twas she.

 

ARTEMIS  
She missed her worship, loathed thy chastity\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Three lives by her one hand\! ’Tis all clear now.

 

ARTEMIS  
Yea, three; thy father and his Queen and thou.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
My father; yea, he too is pitiable\!

 

ARTEMIS  
A plotting Goddess tripped him, and he fell.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Father, where art thou?… Oh, thou sufferest sore\!

 

THESEUS  
Even unto death, child, There is joy no more.

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
I pity thee in this coil; aye, more than me.

 

THESEUS  
Would I could lie there dead instead of thee\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Oh, bitter bounty of Poseidon’s love\!

 

THESEUS  
Would God my lips had never breathed thereof\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS \(*gently*\)  
Nay, thine own rage had slain me then, some wise\!

 

THESEUS  
A lying spirit had made blind mine eyes\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Ah me\!  
Would that a mortal’s curse could reach to God\!

 

ARTEMIS  
Let be\! For not, though deep beneath the sod  
Thou liest, not unrequited nor unsung  
Shall this fell stroke, from Cypris’ rancour sprung,  
Quell thee, mine own, the saintly and the true\!  
My hand shall win its vengeance through and through,  
Piercing with flawless shaft what heart soe’er  
Of all men living is most dear to Her.  
Yea, and to thee, for this sore travail’s sake,  
Honours most high in Trozên will I make;  
For yokeless maids before their bridal night  
Shall shear for thee their tresses; and a rite  
Of honouring tears be thine in ceaseless store;  
And virgin’s thoughts in music evermore  
Turn toward thee, and praise thee in the Song  
Of Phædra’s far-famed love and thy great wrong.  
O seed of ancient Aegeus, bend thee now  
And clasp thy son. Aye, hold and fear not thou\!  
Not knowingly hart thou slain him; and man’s way,  
When Gods send error, needs must fall astray.  
And thou, Hippolytus, shrink not from the King,  
Thy father. Thou wast born to hear this thing.  
Farewell\! I may not watch man’s fleeting breath,  
Nor strain mine eyes with the effluence of death.  
And sure that Terror now is very near.  \[*The cloud slowly rises and floats away.*

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Farewell, farewell, most Blessèd\! Lift thee clear  
Of soiling men\! Thou wilt not grieve in heaven  
For my long love\!… Father, thou art forgiven.  
It was Her will. I am not wrath with thee….  
I have obeyed Her all my days\!…  
                     Ah me,  
The dark is drawing down upon mine eyes;  
It hath me\!… Father\!… Hold me\! Help me rise\!

 

THESEUS \(*supporting him in his arms*\)  
Ah, woe\! How dost thou torture me, my son\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
I see the Great Gates opening. I am gone.

 

THESEUS  
Gone? And my hand red-reeking from this thing\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Nay, nay; thou art assoiled of man slaying.

 

THESEUS  
Thou leav’st me clear of murder? Sayst thou so?

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Yea, by the Virgin of the Stainless Bow\!

 

THESEUS  
Dear Son\! Ah, now I see thy nobleness

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Pray that a true-born child may fill my place.

 

THESEUS  
Ah me, thy righteous and god-fearing heart\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Farewell;  
A long farewell, dear Father, ere we part\!  \[THESEUS *bends down and embraces him passionately.*

 

THESEUS  
Not yet\! — O hope and bear while thou hast breath\!

 

HIPPOLYTUS  
Lo, I have borne my burden. This is death….  
Quick, Father; lay the mantle on my face.  \[THESEUS *covers his face with a mantle and rises.*

 

THESEUS  
Ye bounds of Pallas and of Pelops’ race,  
What greatness have ye lost\!  
                 Woe, woe is me\!  
Thou Cyprian, long shall I remember thee\!

 

CHORUS  
    On all this folk, both low and high,  
A grief hath fallen beyond men’s fears.  
There cometh a throbbing of many tears,  
A sound as of waters falling.  
For when great men die,  
A mighty name and a bitter cry  
Rise up from a nation calling.  \[*They move into the Castle, carrying the body of* HIPPOLYTUS.

DIONYSUS

 

BEHOLD, God’s Son is come unto this land  
Of heaven’s hot splendour lit to life, when she  
Of Thebes, even I, Dionysus, whom the brand  
Who bore me, Cadmus’ daughter Semelê,  
Died here. So, changed in shape from God to man,  
I walk again by Dirce’s streams and scan  
Ismenus’ shore. There by the castle side  
I see her place, the Tomb of the Lightning’s Bride,  
The wreck of smouldering chambers, and the great  
Faint wreaths of fire undying — as the hate  
Dies not, that Hera held for Semelê.  
Aye, Cadmus bath done well; in purity  
He keeps this place apart, inviolate,  
His daughter’s sanctuary; and I have set  
My green and clustered vines to robe it round.  
Far now behind me lies the golden ground  
Of Lydian and of Phrygian; far away  
The wide hot plains where Persian sunbeams play,  
The Bactrian war-holds, and the storm-oppressed  
Clime of the Mede, and Araby the Blest,  
And Asia all, that by the salt sea lies  
In proud embattled cities, motley-wise  
Of Hellene and Barbarian interwrought;  
And now I come to Hellas — having taught  
All the world else my dances and my rite  
Of mysteries, to show me in men’s sight  
Manifest God.  
 And first of Helene lands  
I cry this Thebes to waken; set her hands  
To clasp my wand, mine ivied javelin,  
And round her shoulders hang my wild fawn-skin.  
For they have scorned me whom it least beseemed,  
Semelê’s sisters; mocked my birth, nor deemed  
That Dionysus sprang from Dian seed.  
My mother sinned, said they; and in her need,  
With Cadmus plotting, cloaked her human shame  
With the dread name of Zeus; for that the flame  
From heaven consumed her, seeing she lied to God.  
Thus must they vaunt; and therefore bath my rod  
On them first fallen, and stung them forth wild-eyed  
From empty chambers; the bare mountain side  
Is made their home, and all their hearts are flame.  
Yea, I have bound upon the necks of them  
The harness of my rites. And with them all  
The seed of womankind from hut and hall  
Of Thebes, bath this my magic goaded out.  
And there, with the old King’s daughters, in a rout  
Confused, they make their dwelling-place between  
The roofless rocks and shadowy pine trees green.  
Thus shall this Thebes, how sore soe’er it smart,  
Learn and forget not, till she crave her part  
In mine adoring; thus must I speak clear  
To save my mother’s fame, and crown me here  
As true God, born by Semelê to Zeus.  
Now Cadmus yieldeth up his throne and use  
Of royal honour to his daughter’s son  
Pentheus; who on my body hath begun  
A war with God. He thrusteth me away  
From due drink-offering, and, when men pray,  
My name entreats not. Therefore on his own  
Head and his people’s shall my power he shown.  
Then to another land, when all things here  
Are well, must I fare onward, making clear  
My godhead’s might. But should this Theban town  
Essay with wrath and battle to drag down  
My maids, lo, in their path myself shall be,  
And maniac armies battled after me\!  
For this I veil my godhead with the wan  
Form of the things that die, and walk as Man.

 

O Brood of Tmolus o’er the wide world flown,

 

O Lydian band, my chosen and mine own,  
Damsels uplifted o’er the orient deep  
To wander where I wander, and to sleep  
Where I sleep; up, and wake the old sweet sound,  
The clang that I and mystic Rhea found,  
The Timbrel of the Mountain\! Gather all  
Thebes to your song round Pentheus’ royal hall.  
I seek my new-made worshippers, to guide  
Their dances up Kithaeron’s pine clad side.  \[*As he departs, there comes stealing in from the left a band of fifteen Eastern Women, the light of the sunrise streaming upon their long white robes and ivy-bound hair. They wear fawn-skins over the robes, and carry some of them timbrels, some pipes and other instruments. Many bear the thyrsus or sacred Wand, made of reed ringed with ivy. They enter stealthily till they see that the place is empty, and then begin their mystic song of worship.*

 

CHORUS

 

*A Maiden*  
From Asia, from the dayspring that uprises,  
To Bromios ever glorying we came.  
We laboured for our Lord in many guises;  
We toiled, but the toil is as the prize is;  
Thou Mystery, we hail thee by thy name\!  
*Another*  
Who lingers in the road? Who espies us?  
We shall hide him in his house nor be bold.  
Let the heart keep silence that defies us;  
For I sing this day to Dionysus  
The song that is appointed from of old.  
*All the Maidens*  
Oh, blessèd he in all wise,  
Who hath drunk the Living Fountain,  
Whose life no folly staineth,  
And his soul is near to God;  
Whose sins are lifted, pall-wise,  
As he worships on the Mountain,  
And where Cybele ordaineth,  
Our Mother, he has trod:  
His head with ivy laden  
And his thyrsus tossing high,  
For our God he lifts his cry;  
“Up, O Bacchæ, wife and maiden,  
Come, O ye Bacchæ, come;  
Oh, bring the Joy-bestower,  
God-seed of God the Sower,  
Bring Bromios in his power  
From Phrygia’s mountain dome;  
To street and town and tower,  
Oh, bring ye Bromios home.”  
Whom erst in anguish lying  
For an unborn life’s desire,  
As a dead thing in the Thunder  
His mother cast to earth;  
For her heart was dying, dying,  
In the white heart of the fire;  
Till Zeus, the Lord of Wonder,  
Devised new lairs of birth;  
Yea, his own flesh tore to hide him,  
And with clasps of hitter gold  
Did a secret son enfold,  
And the Queen knew not beside him;  
Till the perfect hour was there;  
Then a hornèd God was found,  
And a God of serpents crowned;  
And for that are serpents wound  
In the wands his maidens bear,  
And the songs of serpents sound  
In the mazes of their hair.  
*Some Maidens*  
All hail, O Thebes, thou nurse of Semelê\!  
With Semelê’s wild ivy crown thy towers;  
Oh, burst in bloom of wreathing bryony,  
Berries and leaves and flowers;  
Uplift the dark divine wand,  
The oak-wand and the pine-wand,  
And don thy fawn-skin, fringed in purity  
With fleecy white, like ours.  
Oh, cleanse thee in the wands’ waving pride\!  
Yea, all men shall dance with us and pray,  
When Bromios his companies shall guide  
Hillward, ever hillward, where they stay,  
The flock of the Believing,  
The maids from loom and weaving  
By the magic of his breath borne away.  
*Others*  
    Hail thou, O Nurse of Zeus, O Caverned Haunt  
Where fierce arms clanged to guard God’s cradle rare,  
For thee of old crested Corybant  
First woke in Cretan air  
The wild orb of our orgies,  
The Timbrel; and thy gorges  
Rang with this Strain; and blended Phrygian chant  
And sweet keen pipes were there.  
But the Timbrel, the Timbrel was another’s,  
And away to Mother Rhea it must wend;  
And to our holy singing from the Mother’s  
The mad Satyrs carried it, to blend  
In the dancing and the cheer  
Of our third and perfect Year;  
And it serves Dionysus in the end\!

 

*A Maiden*  
O glad, glad on the mountains  
To swoon in the race outworn,  
When the holy fawn-skin clings,  
And all else sweeps away,  
To the joy of the red quick fountains,  
The blood of the hill-goat torn,  
The glory of wild-beast ravenings,  
Where the hill-tops catch the day;  
To the Phrygian, Lydian, mountains\!  
’Tis Bromios leads the way.  
*Another Maiden*  
Then streams the earth with milk, yea, streams  
With wine and nectar of the bee,  
And through the air dim perfume steams  
Of Syrian frankincense; and He,  
Our leader, from his thyrsus spray  
A torchlight tosses high and higher,  
A torchlight like a beacon-fire,  
To waken all that faint and stray;  
And sets them leaping as he sings,  
His tresses rippling to the sky,  
And deep beneath the Maenad cry  
His proud voice rings:  
“Come, O ye Bacchæ, come\!”  
*All the Maidens*  
Hither, O fragrant of Tmolus the Golden,  
Come with the voice of timbrel and drum;  
Let the cry of your joyance uplift and embolden  
The God of the joy-cry; O Bacchanals, come\!  
With pealing of pipes and with Phrygian clamour,  
On, where the vision of holiness thrills,  
And the music climbs and the maddening glamour,  
With the wild White Maids, to the hills, to the hills\!  
Oh, then, like a colt as he runs by a river,  
A colt by his dam, when the heart of him sings,  
With the keen limbs drawn and the fleet foot a-quiver,  
Away the Bacchanal springs\!  
*Enter* TEIRESIAS. *He is an old man and blind, leaning upon a staff and moving with slow stateliness, though wearing the Ivy and the Bacchic fawn-skin.*

 

TEIRESIAS  
Ho, there, who keeps the gate? — Go, summon me  
Cadmus, Agênor’s son, who crossed the sea  
From Sidon and upreared this Theban hold.  
Go, whosoe’er thou art. See he be told  
Teiresias seeketh him. Himself will gauge  
Mine errand, and the compact, age with age,  
I vowed with him, grey hair with snow-white hair,  
To deck the new God’s thyrsus, and to wear  
His fawn-skin, and with ivy crown our brows.  
*Enter* CADMUS *from the Castle. He is even older than* TEIRESIAS, *and wears the same attire.*

 

CADMUS  
True friend\! I knew that voice of thine, that flows  
Like mellow wisdom from a fountain wise.  
And, lo, I come prepared, in all the guise  
And harness of this God. Are we not told  
His is the soul of that dead life of old  
That sprang from mine own daughter? Surely then  
Must thou and I with all the strength of men  
Exalt him.  
Where then shall I stand, where tread  
The dance and toss this bowed and hoary head?  
O friend, in thee is wisdom; guide my grey  
And eld-worn steps, eld-worn Teiresias. — Nay;  
I am not weak.  \[*At the first movement of worship his manner begins to change; a mysterious strength and exaltation enter into him.*  
   Surely this arm could smite  
The wild earth with its thyrsus, day and night,  
And faint not\! Sweetly and forgetfully  
The dim years fall from off me\!

 

TEIRESIAS  
                                As with thee,  
With me ’tis likewise. Light am I and young,  
And will essay the dancing and the song.

 

CADMUS  
Quick, then, our chariots to the mountain road.

 

TEIRESIAS  
Nay; to take steeds were to mistrust the God.

 

CADMUS  
So be it. Mine old arms shall guide thee there.

 

TEIRESIAS  
The God himself shall guide\! Have thou no care.

 

CADMUS  
And in all Thebes shall no man dance but we?

 

TEIRESIAS  
Aye, Thebes is blinded. Thou and I can see.

 

CADMUS  
’Tis weary waiting; hold my hand, friend; so.

 

TEIRESIAS  
Lo, there is mine. So linked let us go.

 

CADMUS  
Shall things of dust the Gods’ dark ways despise?

 

TEIRESIAS  
Or prove our wit on Heaven’s high mysteries?  
Not thou and I\! That heritage sublime  
Our sires have left us, wisdom old as time,  
No word of man, how deep soe’er his thought  
And won of subtlest toil, may bring to naught.  
Aye, men will rail that I forgot my years,  
To dance and wreath with ivy these white hairs;  
What recks it? Seeing the God no line bath told  
To mark what man shall dance, or young or old;  
But craves his honours from mortality  
All, no man marked apart; and great shall be\!

 

CADMUS \(*after looking away toward the Mountain*\).  
Teiresias, since this light thou canst not read,  
I must be seer for thee. Here comes in speed  
Pentheus, Echîon’s son, whom I have raised  
To rule my people in my stead. — Amazed  
He seems. Stand close, and mark what we shall hear.  \[*The two stand back, partially concealed, while there enters in hot haste* PENTHEUS, *followed by a bodyguard. He is speaking to the* SOLDIER *in command.*

 

PENTHEUS  
Scarce had I crossed our borders, when mine ear  
Was caught by this strange rumour, that our own  
Wives, our own sisters, from their hearths are flown  
To wild and secret rites; and cluster there  
High on the shadowy hills, with dance and prayer  
To adore this new-made God, this Dionyse,  
Whate’er he be\! — And in their companies  
Deep wine-jars stand, and ever and anon  
Away into the loneliness now one  
Steals forth, and now a second, maid or dame,  
Where love lies waiting, not of God\! The flame,  
They say, of Bacchios wraps them. Bacchios\! Nay,  
’Tis more to Aphrodite that they pray.  
Howbeit, all that I have found, my men  
Hold bound and shackled in our dungeon den;  
The rest, I will go hunt them\! Aye, and snare  
My birds with nets of iron, to quell their prayer  
And mountain song and rites of rascaldom\!  
They tell me, too, there is a stranger come,  
A man of charm and spell, from Lydian seas,  
A head all gold and cloudy fragrancies,  
A wine-red cheek, and eyes that hold the light  
Of the very Cyprian. Day and livelong night  
He haunts amid the damsels, o’er each lip  
Dangling his cup of joyance\! — Let me grip  
Him once, but once, within these walls, right swift  
That wand shall cease its music, and that drift  
Of tossing curls lie still — when my rude sword  
Falls between neck and trunk\! ’Tis all his word,  
This tale of Dionysus; how that same  
Babe that was blasted by the lightning flame  
With his dead mother, for that mother’s lie,  
Was re-conceived, born perfect from the thigh  
Of Zeus, and now is God\! What call ye these?  
Dreams? Gibes of the unknown wanderer? Blasphemies  
That crave the very gibbet?  
               Stay\! God wot,  
Here is another marvel\! See I not  
In motley fawn-skins robed the vision-seer  
Teiresias? And my mother’s father here —   
O depth of scorn\! — adoring with the wand  
Of Bacchios? — Father\! — Nay, mine eyes are fond;  
It is not your white heads so fancy-flown\!  
It cannot be\! Cast off that ivy crown,  
O mine own mother’s sire\! Set free that hand  
That cowers about its staff.  
                 ’Tis thou bast planned  
This work, Teiresias\! ’Tis thou must set  
Another altar and another yet  
Amongst us, watch new birds, and win more hire  
Of gold, interpreting new signs of fire\!  
But for thy silver hairs, I tell thee true,  
Thou now wert sitting chained amid thy crew  
Of raving damsels, for this evil dream  
Thou hast brought us, of new Gods\! When once the gleam  
Of grapes hath lit a Woman’s Festival,  
In all their prayers is no more health at all\!

 

LEADER OF THE CHORUS \(*the words are not heard by* PENTHEUS\)  
Injurious King, hast thou no fear of God,  
Nor Cadmus, sower of the Giants’ Sod,  
Life-spring to great Echîdon and to thee?

 

TEIRESIAS  
Good words, my son, come easily, when he  
That speaks is wise, and speaks but for the right.  
Else come they never\! Swift are thine, and bright  
As though with thought, yet have no thought at all.  
Lo, this new God, whom thou dost flout withal,  
I cannot speak the greatness wherewith He  
In Hellas shall be great\! Two spirits there be,  
Young Prince, that in man’s world are first of worth.  
Dêmêtêr one is named; she is the Earth —   
Call her which name thou will\! — who feeds man’s frame  
With sustenance of things dry. And that which came  
Her work to perfect, second, is the Power  
From Semelê born. He found the liquid shower  
Hid in the grape. He rests man’s spirit dim  
From grieving, when the vine exalteth him.  
He giveth sleep to sink the fretful day  
In cool forgetting. Is there any way  
With man’s sore heart, save only to forget?  
Yea, being God, the blood of him is set  
Before the Gods in sacrifice, that we  
For his sake may be blest. — And so, to thee,  
That fable shames him, how this God was knit  
Into God’s flesh? Nay, learn the truth of it,  
Cleared from the false. — When from that deadly light  
Zeus saved the babe, and up to Olympus’ height  
Raised him, and Hera’s wrath would cast him thence,  
Then Zeus devised him a divine defence.  
A fragment of the world-encircling fire  
He rent apart, and wrought to his desire  
Of shape and hue, in the image of the child,  
And gave to Hera’s rage. And so, beguiled  
By change and passing time, this tale was born,  
How the babe-god was hidden in the torn  
Flesh of his sire. He hath no shame thereby.  
A prophet is he likewise. Prophecy  
Cleaves to all frenzy, but beyond all else  
To frenzy of prayer. Then in us verily dwells  
The God himself, and speaks the thing to be.  
Yea, and of Ares’ realm a part hath he.  
When mortal armies, mailèd and arrayed,  
Have in strange fear, or ever blade met blade,  
Fled maddened, ’tis this God hath palsied them.  
Aye, over Delphi’s rock-built diadem  
Thou yet shalt see him leaping with his train  
Of fire across the twin-peaked mountain-plain,  
Flaming the darkness with his mystic wand,  
And great in Hellas. — List and understand,  
King Pentheus\! Dream not thou that force is power;  
Nor, if thou hast a thought, and that thought sour  
And sick, oh, dream not thought is wisdom\! — Up,  
Receive this God to Thebes; pour forth the cup  
Of sacrifice, and pray, and wreathe thy brow.  
Thou fearest for the damsels? Think thee now;  
How toucheth this the part of Dionyse  
To hold maids pure perforce? In them it lies,  
And their own hearts; and in the wildest rite  
Cometh no stain to her whose heart is white.  
Nay, mark me\! Thou hast thy joy, when the Gate  
Stands thronged, and Pentheus’ name is lifted great  
And high by Thebes in clamour; shall not He  
Rejoice in his due meed of majesty?  
Howbeit, this Cadmus whom thou scorn’st and I  
Will wear His crown, and tread His dances\! Aye,  
Our hairs are white, yet shall that dance be trod\!  
I will not lift mine arm to war with God  
For thee nor all thy words. Madness most fell  
Is on thee, madness wrought by some dread spell,  
But not by spell nor leechcraft to be cured\!

 

CHORUS  
Grey prophet, worthy of Phoebus is thy word,  
And wise in honouring Bromios, our great God.

 

CADMUS  
My son, right well Teiresias points thy road.  
Oh, make thine habitation here with us,  
Not lonely, against men’s uses. Hazardous  
Is this quick bird-like beating of thy thought  
Where no thought dwells. — Grant that this God be naught,  
Yet let that Naught be Somewhat in thy mouth;  
Lie boldly, and say He is\! So north and south  
Shall marvel, how there sprang a thing divine  
From Semelê’s flesh, and honour all our line.  \[*Drawing nearer to* PENTHEUS.  
Is there not blood before thine eyes even now?  
Our lost Actaeon’s blood, whom long ago  
His own red hounds through yonder forest dim  
Tore unto death, because he vaunted him  
Against most holy Artemis? Oh, beware,  
And let me wreathe thy temples. Make thy prayer  
With us, and walk thee humbly in God’s sight.  \[*He makes as if to set the wreath on* PENTHEUS’ *head.*

 

PENTHEUS  
Down with that hand\! Aroint thee to thy rite,  
Nor smear on me thy foul contagion\!  \[*Turning upon* TEIRESIAS.  
                       This  
Thy folly’s head and prompter shall not miss  
The justice that he needs\! — Go, half my guard,  
Forth to the rock-seat where he dwells in ward  
O’er birds and wonders; rend the stone with crow  
And trident; make one wreck of high and low,  
And toss his hands to all the winds of air\!  
Ha, have I found the way to sting thee, there?  
The rest, forth through the town\! And seek amain  
This girl-faced stranger, that hath wrought such bane  
To all Thebes, preying on our maids and wives.  
Seek till ye find; and lead him here in gyves,  
Till he be judged and stoned and weep in blood  
The day he troubled Pentheus with his God\!  \[*The guards set forth in two bodies;* PENTHEUS *goes into the Castle.*

 

TEIRESIAS  
Hard heart, how little dost thou know what seed  
Thou sowest\! Blind before, and now indeed  
Most mad\! — Come, Cadmus, let us go our way,  
And pray for this our persecutor, pray  
For this poor city, that the righteous God  
Move not in anger. — Take thine ivy rod  
And help my steps, as I help thine. ‘Twere ill,  
If two old men should fall by the roadway. Still,  
Come what come may, our service shall be done  
To Bacchios, the All-Father’s mystic son.

 

O Pentheus, named of sorrow\! Shall he claim  
From all thy house fulfilment of his name,  
Old Cadmus? — Nay, I speak not from mine art,  
But as I see — blind words and a blind heart\!  \[*The two Old Men go off towards the Mountain.*

 

CHORUS  
*Some Maidens*  
Thou Immaculate on high;  
Thou Recording Purity;  
Thou that stoopest, Golden Wing,  
Earthward, manward, pitying,  
Hearest thou this angry King?  
Hearest thou the rage and scorn  
‘Gainst the Lord of Many Voices,  
Him of mortal mother born,  
Him in whom man’s heart rejoices,  
Girt with garlands and with glee,  
First in Heaven’s sovranty?  
For his kingdom, it is there,  
In the dancing and the prayer,  
In the music and the laughter,  
In the vanishing of care,  
And of all before and after;  
In the Gods’ high banquet, when  
Gleams the grape-flood, flashed to heaven;  
Yea, and in the feasts of men  
Comes his crownèd slumber; then  
Pain is dead and hate forgiven\!  
*Others*  
Loose thy lips from out the rein;  
Lift thy wisdom to disdain;  
Whatso law thou canst not see,  
Scorning; so the end shall be  
Uttermost calamity\!  
’Tis the life of quiet breath,  
’Tis the simple and the true,  
Storm nor earthquake shattereth,  
Nor shall aught the house undo  
Where they dwell. For, far away,  
Hidden from the eyes of day,  
Watchers are there in the skies,  
That can see man’s life, and prize  
Deeds well done by things of clay.  
But the world’s Wise are not wise,  
Claiming more than mortal may.  
Life is such a little thing;  
Lo, their present is departed,  
And the dreams to which they cling  
Come not. Mad imagining  
Theirs, I ween, and empty-hearted\!  
*Divers Maidens*  
    Where is the Home for me?

 

O Cyprus, set in the sea,  
Aphrodite’s home In the soft sea-foam,  
Would I could wend to thee;  
Where the wings of the Loves are furled,  
And faint the heart of the world.  
Aye, unto Paphos’ isle,  
Where the rainless meadows smile  
With riches rolled From the hundred-fold  
Mouths of the far-off Nile,  
Streaming beneath the waves  
To the roots of the seaward caves.  
But a better land is there  
Where Olympus cleaves the air,  
The high still dell Where the Muses dwell,  
Fairest of all things fair\!  
O there is Grace, and there is the Heart’s Desire,  
And peace to adore thee, thou Spirit of Guiding Fire\!  
 ——  ——  —— 

 

A God of Heaven is he,  
And horn in majesty;  
Yet hath he mirth In the joy of the Earth,  
And he loveth constantly  
Her who brings increase,  
The Feeder of Children, Peace.  
No grudge hath he of the great;  
No scorn of the mean estate;  
But to all that liveth His wine he giveth,  
Griefless, immaculate;  
Only on them that spurn  
Joy, may his anger burn.  
Love thou the Day and the Night;  
Be glad of the Dark and the Light;  
And avert thine eyes From the lore of the wise,  
That have honour in proud men’s sight.  
The simple nameless herd of Humanity  
Hath deeds and faith that are truth enough for me\!  \[*As the Chorus ceases, a party of the guards return, leading in the midst of them* DIONYSUS, *bound. The* SOLDIER *in command stands forth, as* PENTHEUS, *hearing the tramp of feet, comes out from the Castle.*

 

SOLDIER  
Our quest is finished, and thy prey, O King,  
Caught; for the chase was swift, and this wild thing  
Most tame; yet never flinched, nor thought to flee,  
But held both hands out unresistingly —   
No change, no blanching of the wine-red cheek.  
He waited while we came, and bade us wreak  
All thy decree; yea, laughed, and made my best  
Easy, till I for very shame confessed  
And said: “O stranger, not of mine own will  
I bind thee, but his bidding to fulfil  
Who sent me.”  
 And those prisoned Maids withal  
Whom thou didst seize and bind within the wall  
Of thy great dungeon, they are fled, O King,  
Free in the woods, a-dance and glorying  
To Bromios. Of their own impulse fell  
To earth, men say, fetter and manacle,  
And bars slid back untouched of mortal hand.  
Yea, full of many wonders to thy land  
Is this man come…. Howbeit, it lies with thee\!

 

PENTHEUS  
Ye are mad\! — Unhand him. Howso swift he be,  
My toils are round him and he shall not fly.  \[*The guards loose the arms of* DIONYSUS; PENTHEUS *studies him for a while in silence, then speaks jeeringly.* DIONYSUS *remains gentle and unafraid.*  
Marry, a fair shape for a woman’s eye,  
Sir stranger\! And thou seek’st no more, I ween\!  
Long curls, withal\! That shows thou ne’er hast been  
A wrestler\! — down both cheeks so softly tossed  
And winsome\! And a white skin\! It hath cost  
Thee pains, to please thy damsels with this white  
And red of cheeks that never face the light\!  \[DIONYSUS *is silent.*  
Speak, sirrah; tell me first thy name and race.

 

DIONYSUS  
No glory is therein, nor yet disgrace.  
Thou hast heard of Tmolus, the bright hill of flowers?

 

PENTHEUS  
Surely, the ridge that winds by Sardis towers.

 

DIONYSUS  
Thence am I; Lydia was my fatherland.

 

PENTHEUS  
And whence these revelations, that thy band  
Spreadeth in Hellas?

 

DIONYSUS  
                      Their intent and use  
Dionysus oped to me, the Child of Zeus.

 

PENTHEUS \(*brutally*\)  
Is there a Zeus there, that can still beget  
Young Gods?

 

DIONYSUS  
            Nay, only He whose seal was set  
Here in thy Thebes on Semele.

 

PENTHEUS  
                              What way  
Descended he upon thee? In full day  
Or vision of night?

 

DIONYSUS  
                    Most clear he stood, and scanned  
My soul, and gave his emblems to mine hand.

 

PENTHEUS  
What like be they, these emblems?

 

DIONYSUS  
                                  That may none  
Reveal, nor know, save his Elect alone.

 

PENTHEUS  
And what good bring they to the worshipper?

 

DIONYSUS  
Good beyond price, but not for thee to hear.

 

PENTHEUS  
Thou trickster? Thou wouldst prick me on the more  
To seek them out\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                  His mysteries abhor  
The touch of sin-lovers.

 

PENTHEUS  
                          And so thine eyes  
Saw this God plain; what guise had he?

 

DIONYSUS  
                                        What guise  
It liked him. ’Twas not I ordained his shape.

 

PENTHEUS  
Aye, deftly turned again. An idle jape,  
And nothing answered\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                      Wise words being brought  
To blinded eyes will seem as things of nought.

 

PENTHEUS  
And comest thou first to Thebes, to have thy God  
Established?

 

DIONYSUS  
              Nay; all Barbary hath trod  
His dance ere this.

 

PENTHEUS  
                    A low blind folk, I ween,  
Beside our Hellenes\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                      Higher and more keen  
In this thing, though their ways are not thy way.

 

PENTHEUS  
How is thy worship held, by night or day?

 

DIONYSUS  
Most oft by night; ’tis a majestic thing,  
The darkness.

 

PENTHEUS  
              Ha\! with women worshipping?  
’Tis craft and rottenness\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                            By day no less,  
Whoso will seek may find unholiness.

 

PENTHEUS  
Enough\! Thy doom is fixed, for false pretence  
Corrupting Thebes.

 

DIONYSUS  
                    Not mine; but thine, for dense  
Blindness of heart, and for blaspheming God\!

 

PENTHEUS  
A ready knave it is, and brazen-browed,  
This mystery-priest\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                      Come, say what it shall be,  
My doom; what dire thing wilt thou do to me?

 

PENTHEUS  
First, shear that delicate curl that dangles there.  \[*He beckons to the soldiers, who approach* DIONYSUS.

 

DIONYSUS  
I have vowed it to my God; ’tis holy hair.  \[*The soldiers cut off the tress.*

 

PENTHEUS  
Next, yield me up thy staff\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                              Raise thine own hand  
To take it. This is Dionysus’ wand.  \[PENTHEUS *takes the staff.*

 

PENTHEUS  
Last, I will hold thee prisoned here.

 

DIONYSUS  
                                      My Lord  
God will unloose me, when I speak the word.

 

PENTHEUS  
He may, if e’er again amid his bands  
Of saints he hears thy voice\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                              Even now he stands  
Close here, and sees all that I suffer.

 

PENTHEUS  
                                        What?  
Where is he? For mine eyes discern him not.

 

DIONYSUS  
Where I am\! ’Tis thine own impurity  
That veils him from thee.

 

PENTHEUS  
                          The dog jeers at me\!  
At me and Thebes\! Bind him\!  \[*The soldiers begin to bind him.*

 

DIONYSUS  
                            I charge ye, bind  
Me not\! I having vision and ye blind\!

 

PENTHEUS  
And I, with better right, say hind the more\!  \[*The soldiers obey.*

 

DIONYSUS  
Thou knowest not what end thou seekest, nor  
What deed thou doest, nor what man thou art\!

 

PENTHEUS \(*mocking*\)  
Agàvê’s son, and on the father’s part  
Echîon’s, hight Pentheus\!

 

DIONYSUS  
So let it be,  
A name fore-written to calamity\!

 

PENTHEUS  
Away, and tie him where the steeds are tied;  
Aye, let him lie in the manger\! — There abide  
And stare into the darkness\! — And this rout  
Of womankind that clusters thee about,  
Thy ministers of worship, are ray slaves\!  
It may he I will sell them o’er the waves,  
Hither and thither; else they shall be set  
To labour at my distaffs, and forget  
Their timbrel and their songs of dawning day\!

 

DIONYSUS  
I go; for that which may not be, I may  
Not suffer\! Yet for this thy sin, lo, He  
Whom thou deniest cometh after thee  
For recompense. Yea, in thy wrong to us,  
Thou hast cast Him into thy prison-house\!  \[DIONYSUS, *without his wand, his hair shorn, and his arms tightly bound, is led off by the guards to his dungeon.* PENTHEUS *returns into the Palace.*

 

CHORUS  
*Some Maidens*  
AcheIoüs’ roaming daughter,  
Holy Dircê, virgin water,  
Bathed he not of old in thee,  
The Babe of God, the Mystery?  
When from out the fire immortal  
To himself his God did take him,  
To his own flesh, and bespake him:  
“Enter now life’s second portal,  
Motherless Mystery; lo, I break  
Mine own body for thy sake,  
Thou of the Twofold Door, and seal thee  
Mine, O Bromios,” — thus he spake —   
“And to this thy land reveal thee.”  
All

 

    Still my prayer toward thee quivers,  
Dircê, still to thee I hie me;  
Why, O Blessèd among Rivers,  
Wilt thou fly me and deny me?  
By His own joy I vow,  
By the grape upon the bough,  
Thou shalt seek Him in the midnight, thou shalt love  
Him, even now\!  
*Other Maidens*  
    Dark and of the dark impassioned  
Is this Pentheus’ blood; yea, fashioned  
Of the Dragon, and his birth  
From Echîon, child of Earth.  
He is no man, but a wonder;  
Did the Earth-Child not beget him,  
As a red Giant, to set him  
Against God, against the Thunder?  
He will hind me for his prize,  
Me, the Bride of Dionyse;  
And my priest, my friend, is taken  
Even now, and buried lies;  
In the dark he lies forsaken\!  
All

 

    Lo, we race with death, we perish,  
Dionysus, here before thee\!  
Dost thou mark us not, nor cherish,  
Who implore thee, and adore thee?  
Hither down Olympus’ side,  
Come, O Holy One defied,  
Be thy golden wand uplifted o’er the tyrant in his pride\!

 

*A Maiden*  
Oh, where art thou? In thine own  
Nysa, thou our help alone?  
O’er fierce beasts in orient lands  
Doth thy thronging thyrsus wave,  
By the high Corycian Cave,  
Or where stern Olympus stands;  
In the elm-woods and the oaken,  
There where Orpheus harped of old,  
And the trees awoke and knew him,  
And the wild things gathered to him,  
As he sang amid the broken  
Glens his music manifold?  
Dionysus loveth thee;  
Blessed Land of Piêrie,  
He will come to thee with dancing,  
Come with joy and mystery;  
With the Maenads at his hest  
Winding, winding to the West;  
Cross the flood of swiftly glancing  
Axios in majesty;  
Cross the Lydias, the giver  
Of good gifts and waving green;  
Cross that Father-Stream of story,  
Through a land of steeds and glory  
Rolling, bravest, fairest River  
E’er of mortals seen\!

 

A VOICE WITHIN  
                        Io\! Io\!  
Awake, ye damsels; hear my cry,  
Calling my Chosen; hearken ye\!

 

A MAIDEN  
Who speaketh? Oh, what echoes thus?

 

ANOTHER

 

A Voice, a Voice, that calleth us\!

 

THE VOICE  
Be of good cheer\! Lo, it is I,  
The Child of Zeus and Semelê.

 

A MAIDEN

 

O Master, Master, it is Thou\!

 

ANOTHER

 

O Holy Voice, be with us now\!

 

THE VOICE  
Spirit of the Chained Earthquake,  
Hear my word; awake, awake\!  \[*An Earthquake suddenly shakes the pillars of the Castle.*

 

A MAIDEN  
Ha\! what is coming? Shall the hall  
Of Pentheus racked in ruin fall?

 

LEADER  
Our God is in the house\! Ye maids adore Him\!

 

CHORUS  
                        We adore Him all\!

 

THE VOICE  
Unveil the Lighning’s eye; arouse  
The fire that sleeps, against this house\!  \[*Fire leaps upon the Tomb of Semelê.*

 

A MAIDEN  
Ah, saw ye, marked ye there the flame  
From Semelê’s enhallowed sod  
Awakened? Yea, the Death that came  
Ablaze from heaven of old, the same  
Hot splendour of the shaft of God?

 

LEADER  
Oh, cast ye, cast ye, to the earth\! The Lord  
Cometh against this house\! Oh, cast ye down,  
Ye trembling damsels; He, our own adored,  
God’s Child bath come, and all is overthrown\!  \[*The Maidens cast themselves upon the ground, their eyes earthward.* DIONYSUS, *alone and unbound, enters from the Castle.*

 

DIONYSUS  
Ye Damsels of the Morning Hills, why lie ye thus dismayed?  
Ye marked him, then, our Master, and the mighty hand he laid  
On tower and rock, shaking the house of Pentheus? — But arise,  
And cast the trembling from your flesh and lift untroubled eyes.

 

LEADER

 

O Light in Darkness, is it thou? O Priest, is this thy face?  
My heart leaps out to greet thee from the deep of loneliness.

 

DIONYSUS  
Fell ye so quick despairing, when beneath the Gate I passed?  
Should the gates of Pentheus quell me, or his darkness make me fast?

 

LEADER  
Oh, what was left if thou wert gone? What could I but despair?  
How hast thou ‘scaped the man of sin? Who freed thee from the snare?

 

DIONYSUS  
I had no pain nor peril; ’twas mine own hand set me free.

 

LEADER  
Thine arms were gyvèd\!

 

DIONYSUS  
        Nay, no gyve, no touch, was laid on me\!  
’Twas there I mocked him, in his gyves, and gave him dreams for food.  
For when he laid me down, behold, before the stall there stood

 

A Bull of Offering. And this King, he bit his lips, and straight  
Fell on and bound it, hoof and limb, with gasping wrath and sweat  
And I sat watching\! — Then a Voice; and lo, our Lord was come,  
And the house shook, and a great flame stood o’er his mother’s tomb.  
And Pentheus hied this way and that, and called his thralls amain  
For water, lest his roof-tree burn; and all toiled, all in vain.  
Then deemed a-sudden I was gone; and left his fire, and sped  
Back to the prison portals, and his lifted sword shone red.  
But there, methinks, the God had wrought — I speak but as I guess —   
Some dream-shape in mine image; for he smote at emptiness,  
Stabbed in the air, and strove in wrath, as though ‘twere me he slew.  
Then ‘mid his dreams God smote him yet again\! He overthrew  
All that high house. And there in wreck for ever more it lies,  
That the day of this my bondage may he sore in Pentheus’ eyes\!  
And now his sword is fallen, and he lies outworn and wan  
Who dared to rise against his God in wrath, being but man.  
And I uprose and left him, and in all peace took my path  
Force to my Chosen, recking light of Pentheus and his wrath.  
But soft, methinks a footstep sounds even now within the hall;  
’Tis he; how think ye he will stand, and what words speak withal?  
I will endure him gently, though lie come in fury hot.  
For still are the ways of Wisdom, and her temper trembleth not\!  
*Enter* PENTHEUS *in fury*

 

PENTHEUS  
It is too much\! This Eastern knave bath slipped  
His prison, whom I held but now, hard gripped  
In bondage. — Ha\! ’Tis he\! — What, sirrah, how  
Show’st thou before my portals?  \[*He advances furiously upon him.*

 

DIONYSUS  
And set a quiet carriage to thy rage.

 

PENTHEUS  
How comest thou here? How didst thou break thy cage?  
Speak\!

 

DIONYSUS  
        Said I not, or didst thou mark not me,  
There was One living that should set me free?

 

PENTHEUS  
Who? Ever wilder are these tales of thine.

 

DIONYSUS  
He who first made for man the clustered vine.

 

PENTHEUS  
I scorn him and his vines.

 

DIONYSUS  
                            For Dionyse  
’Tis well; for in thy scorn his glory lies.

 

PENTHEUS \(*to his guard*\)  
Go swift to all the towers, and bar withal  
Each gate\!

 

DIONYSUS  
            What, cannot God o’erleap a wall?

 

PENTHEUS  
Oh, wit thou hast, save where thou needest it\!

 

DIONYSUS  
Whereso it most imports, there is my wit\! —   
Nay, peace\! Abide till he who hasteth from  
The mountain side with news for thee, be come.  
We will not fly, but wait on thy command.  \[*Enter suddenly and in haste a Messenger from the Mountain.*

 

MESSENGER  
Great Pentheus, Lord of all this Theban land,  
I come from high Kithaeron, where the frore  
Snow spangles gleam and cease not evermore….

 

PENTHEUS  
And what of import may thy coming bring?

 

MESSENGER  
I have seen the Wild White Women there, O King,  
Whose fleet limbs darted arrow-like but now  
From Thebes away, and come to tell thee how  
They work strange deeds and passing marvel. Yet  
I first would learn thy pleasure. Shall I set  
My whole tale forth, or veil the stranger part?  
Yea, Lord, I fear the swiftness of thy heart,  
Thine edged wrath and more than royal soul.

 

PENTHEUS  
Thy tale shall nothing scathe thee. — Tell the whole.  
It skills not to be wroth with honesty.  
Nay, if thy news of them be dark, ’tis he  
Shall pay it, who bewitched and led them on.

 

MESSENGER  
Our herded kine were moving in the dawn  
Up to the peaks, the greyest, coldest time,  
When the first rays steal earthward, and the rime  
Yields, when I saw three bands of them. The one  
Autonoë led, one Ino, one thine own  
Mother, Agâvê. There beneath the trees  
Sleeping they lay, like wild things flung at ease  
In the forest; one half sinking on a bed  
Of deep pine greenery; one with careless head  
Amid the fallen oak leaves; all most cold  
In purity — not as thy tale was told  
Of wine-cups and wild music and the chase  
For love amid the forest’s loneliness.  
Then rose the Queen Agâvê suddenly  
Amid her band, and gave the God’s wild cry,  
“Awake, ye Bacchanals\! I hear the sound  
Of hornèd kine. Awake ye\!” — Then, all round,  
Alert, the warm sleep fallen from their eyes,  
A marvel of swift ranks I saw them rise,  
Dames young and old, and gentle maids unwed  
Among them. O’er their shoulders first they shed  
Their tresses, and caught up the fallen fold  
Of mantles where some clasp had loosened hold,  
And girt the dappled fawn-skins in with long  
Quick snakes that hissed and writhed with quivering tongue,  
And one a young fawn held, and one a wild  
Wolf cub, and fed them with white milk, and smiled  
In love, young mothers with a mother’s breast  
And babes at home forgotten\! Then they pressed  
Wreathed ivy round their brows, and oaken sprays  
And flowering bryony. And one would raise  
Her wand and smite the rock, and straight a jet  
Of quick bright water came. Another set  
Her thyrsus in the bosomed earth, and there  
Was red wine that the God sent up to her,  
A darkling fountain. And if any lips  
Sought whiter draughts, with dipping finger-tips  
They pressed the sod, and gushing from the ground  
Came springs of milk. And reed-wands ivy-crowned  
Ran with sweet honey, drop by drop. — O King,  
Hadst thou been there, as I, and seen this thing,  
With prayer and most high wonder hadst thou gone  
To adore this God whom now thou rail’st upon\!  
Howbeit, the kine-wardens and shepherds straight  
Came to one place, amazed, and held debate;  
And one being there who walked the streets and scanned  
The ways of speech, took lead of them whose hand  
Knew but the slow soil and the solemn hill,  
And flattering spoke, and asked: “Is it your will,  
Masters, we stay the mother of the King,  
Agâvê, from her lawless worshipping,  
And win us royal thanks?” — And this seemed good  
To all; and through the branching underwood  
We hid us, cowering in the leaves. And there  
Through the appointed hour they made their prayer  
And worship of the Wand, with one accord  
Of heart and cry— “Iacchos, Bromios, Lord,  
God of God born\!” — And all the mountain felt,  
And worshipped with them; and the wild things knelt  
And ramped and gloried, and the wilderness  
Was filled with moving voices and dim stress.  
Soon, as it chanced, beside my thicket-close  
The Queen herself passed dancing, and I rose  
And sprang to seize her. But she turned her face  
Upon me: “Ho, my rovers of the chase,  
My wild White Hounds, we are hunted\! Up, each rod  
And follow, follow, for our Lord and God\!”  
Thereat, for fear they tear us, all we fled  
Amazed; and on, with hand unweaponèd  
They swept toward our herds that browsed the green  
Hill grass. Great uddered kine then hadst thou seen  
Bellowing in sword-like hands that cleave and tear,  
A live steer riven asunder, and the air  
Tossed with rent ribs or limbs of cloven tread,  
And flesh upon the branches, and a red  
Rain from the deep green pines. Yea, bulls of pride,  
Horns swift to rage, were fronted and aside  
Flung stumbling, by those multitudinous hands  
Dragged pitilessly. And swifter were the bands  
Of garbèd flesh and bone unbound withal  
Than on thy royal eyes the lids may fall.  
Then on like birds, by their own speed upborne,  
They swept toward the plains of waving corn  
That lie beside Asopus’ banks, and bring  
To Thebes the rich fruit of her harvesting.  
On Hysiae and Erythrae that lie nursed  
Amid Kithaeron’s bowering rocks, they burst  
Destroying, as a foeman’s army comes.  
They caught up little children from their homes,  
High on their shoulders, babes unheld, that swayed  
And laughed and fell not; all a wreck they made;  
Yea, bronze and iron did shatter, and in play  
Struck hither and thither, yet no wound had they;  
Caught fire from out the hearths, yea, carried hot  
Flames in their tresses and were scorchèd not\!  
The village folk in wrath took spear and sword,  
And turned upon the Bacchæ. Then, dread Lord,  
The wonder was. For spear nor barbèd brand  
Could scathe nor touch the damsels; but the Wand,  
The soft and wreathèd wand their white hands sped,  
Blasted those men and quelled them, and they fled  
Dizzily. Sure some God was in these things\!  
And the holy women back to those strange springs  
Returned, that God had sent them when the day  
Dawned, on the upper heights; and washed away  
The stain of battle. And those girdling snakes  
Hissed out to lap the waterdrops from cheeks  
And hair and breast.  
         Therefore I counsel thee,

 

O King, receive this Spirit, whoe’er he be,  
To Thebes in glory. Greatness manifold  
Is all about him; and the tale is told  
That this is he who first to man did give  
The grief-assuaging vine. Oh, let him live;  
For if he die, then Love herself is slain,  
And nothing joyous in the world again

 

LEADER  
Albeit I tremble, and scarce may speak my thought  
To a king’s face, yet will I hide it not.  
Dionyse is God, no God more true nor higher\!

 

PENTHEUS  
It bursts hard by us, like a smothered fire,  
This frenzy of Bacchic women\! All my land  
Is made their mock. — This needs an iron hand\!  
Ho, Captain\! Quick to the Electran Gate;  
Bid gather all my men-at-arms thereat;  
Call all that spur the charger, all who know  
To wield the orbèd targe or bend the bow;  
We march to war— ‘Fore God, shall women dare  
Such deeds against us? ’Tis too much to bear\!

 

DIONYSUS  
Thou mark’st me not, O King, and boldest light  
My solemn words; yet, in thine own despite,  
I warn thee still. Lift thou not up thy spear  
Against a God, but hold thy peace, and fear  
His wrath\! He will not brook it, if thou fright  
His Chosen from the hills of their delight.

 

PENTHEUS  
Peace, thou\! And if for once thou hast slipped thy chain,  
Give thanks\! — Or shall I knot thine arms again?

 

DIONYSUS  
Better to yield him prayer and sacrifice  
Than kick against the pricks, since Dionyse  
Is God, and thou but mortal.

 

PENTHEUS  
                              That will I\!  
Yea, sacrifice of women’s blood, to cry  
His name through all Kithaeron\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                                Ye shall fly,  
All, and abase your shields of bronzen rim  
Before their wands.

 

PENTHEUS  
                    There is no way with him,  
This stranger that so dogs us\! Well or ill  
I may entreat him, he must babble still\!

 

DIONYSUS  
Wait, good my friend\! These crooked matters may  
Even yet be straightened.  \[PENTHEUS *has started as though to seek his army at the gate.*

 

PENTHEUS  
                          Aye, if I obey  
Mine own slaves’ will; how else?

 

DIONYSUS  
                                  Myself will lead  
The damsels hither, without sword or steed.

 

PENTHEUS  
How now? — This is some plot against me\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                                        What  
Dost fear? Only to save thee do I plot.

 

PENTHEUS  
It is some compact ye have made, whereby  
To dance these hills for ever\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                                Verily,  
That is my compact, plighted with my Lord\!

 

PENTHEUS \(*turning from him*\)  
Ho, armourers\! Bring forth my shield and sword\! —   
And thou, be silent\!

 

DIONYSUS  
\(*after regarding him fixedly, speaks with resignation*\)  
         Ah\! — Have then thy will\!  \[*He fixes his eyes upon* PENTHEUS *again, while the armourers bring out his armour; then speaks in a tone of command.*  
Man, thou wouldst fain behold them on the hill  
Praying\!

 

PENTHEUS  
\(*who during the rest of this scene, with a few exceptions, simply speaks the thoughts that* DIONYSUS *puts into him, losing power over his own mind*\).  
That would I, though it cost me all  
The gold of Thebes\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                    So much? Thou art quick to fall  
To such great longing.

 

PENTHEUS  
\(*somewhat bewildered at what he has said*\)  
           Aye; ’twould grieve me much  
To see them flown with wine.

 

DIONYSUS  
                              Yet cravest thou such  
A sight as would much grieve thee?

 

PENTHEUS  
                                    Yes; I fain  
Would watch, ambushed among the pines.

 

DIONYSUS  
                                        ‘Twere vain  
To hide. They soon will track thee out.

 

PENTHEUS  
                                        Well said  
‘Twere best done openly.

 

DIONYSUS  
                          Wilt thou be led  
By me, and try the venture?

 

PENTHEUS  
                            Aye, indeed\!  
Lead on. Why should we tarry?

 

DIONYSUS  
                              First we need  
A rich and trailing robe of fine-linen  
To gird thee.

 

PENTHEUS  
              Nay; am I a woman, then,  
And no man more,

 

DIONYSUS  
                  Wouldst have them slay thee dead?  
No man may see their mysteries.

 

PENTHEUS  
                                Well said\! —   
I marked thy subtle temper long ere now.

 

DIONYSUS  
’Tis Dionyse that prompteth me.

 

PENTHEUS  
                                And how  
Mean’st thou the further plan?

 

DIONYSUS  
                                First take thy way  
Within. I will array thee.

 

PENTHEUS  
                            What array\!  
The woman’s? Nay, I will not.

 

DIONYSUS  
                              Doth it change  
So soon, all thy desire to see this strange  
Adoring?

 

PENTHEUS  
          Wait\! What garb wilt thou bestow  
About me?

 

DIONYSUS  
          First a long tress dangling low  
Beneath thy shoulders.

 

PENTHEUS  
                        Aye, and next?

 

DIONYSUS  
                                        The said  
Robe, falling to thy feet; and on thine head  
A snood.

 

PENTHEUS  
          And after? Hast thou aught beyond?

 

DIONYSUS  
Surely; the dappled fawn-skin and the wand.

 

PENTHEUS \(*after a struggle with himself*\)  
Enough\! I cannot wear a robe and snood.

 

DIONYSUS  
Wouldst liefer draw the sword and spill men’s blood?

 

PENTHEUS \(*again doubting*\)  
True, that were evil. — Aye; ’tis best to go  
First to some place of watch.

 

DIONYSUS  
                              Far wiser so,  
Than seek by wrath wrath’s bitter recompense.

 

PENTHEUS  
What of the city streets? Canst lead me hence  
Unseen of any?

 

DIONYSUS  
                Lonely and untried  
Thy path from hence shall be, and I thy guide\!

 

PENTHEUS  
I care for nothing, so these Bacchanals  
Triumph not against me\!… Forward to my halls  
Within\! — I will ordain what seemeth best.

 

DIONYSUS  
So be it, O King\! ’Tis mine to obey thine hest,  
Whate’er it be.

 

PENTHEUS  
\(*after hesitating once more and waiting*\)  
   Well, I will go — perchance  
To march and scatter them with serried lance,  
Perchance to take thy plan…. I know not yet.  \[*Exit* PENTHEUS *into the Castle.*

 

DIONYSUS  
Damsels, the lion walketh to the net\!  
He finds his Bacchæ now, and sees and dies,  
And pays for all his sin\! — O Dionyse,  
This is thine hour and thou not far away.  
Grant us our vengeance\! — First, O Master, stay  
The course of reason in him, and instil  
A foam of madness. Let his seeing will,  
Which ne’er had stooped to put thy vesture on,  
Be darkened, till the deed is lightly done.  
Grant likewise that he find through all his streets  
Loud scorn, this man of wrath and bitter threats  
That made Thebes tremble, led in woman’s guise.  
I go to fold that robe of sacrifice  
On Penthet’s, that shall deck him to the dark,  
His mother’s gift\! — So shall he learn and mark  
God’s true Son, Dionyse, in fulness God,  
Most fearful, yet to man most soft of mood.  \[*Exit* DIONYSUS, *following* PENTHEUS *into the Castle.*

 

CHORUS  
*Some Maidens*  
Will they ever come to me, ever again,  
The long long dances,  
On through the dark till the dim stars wane?  
Shall I feel the dew on my throat, and the stream  
Of wind in my hair? Shall our white feet gleam  
In the dim expanses?  
Oh, feet of a fawn to the greenwood fled,  
Alone in the grass and the loveliness;  
Leap of the hunted, no more in dread,  
Beyond the snares and the deadly press:  
Yet a voice still in the distance sounds,  
A voice and a fear and a haste of hounds;  
O wildly labouring, fiercely fleet,  
Onward yet by river and glen…  
Is it joy or terror, ye storm-swift feet?…  
To the dear lone lands untroubled of men,  
Where no voice sounds, and amid the shadowy green  
The little things of the woodland live unseen.  
What else is Wisdom? What of man’s endeavour  
Or God’s high grace, so lovely and so great?  
To stand from fear set free, to breathe and wait;  
To hold a hand uplifted over Hate;  
And shall not Loveliness he loved for ever?  
*Others*  
    O Strength of God, slow art thou and still,  
Yet failest never\!  
On them that worship the Ruthless Will,  
On them that dream, doth His judgment wait.  
Dreams of the proud man, making great  
And greater ever,  
Things which are not of God. In wide  
And devious coverts, hunter-wise,  
He coucheth Time’s unhasting stride,  
Following, following, him whose eyes  
Look not to Heaven. For all is vain,  
The pulse of the heart, the plot of the brain,  
That striveth beyond the laws that live.  
And is thy Fate so much to give,  
Is it so bard a thing to see,  
That the Spirit of God, whate’er it be,  
The Law that abides and changes not, ages long,  
The Eternal and Nature-born — these things be strong?  
What else is Wisdom? What of man’s endeavour  
Or God’s high grace so lovely and so great?  
To stand from fear set free, to breathe and wait;  
To hold a hand uplifted over Hate;  
And shall not Loveliness be loved for ever?

 

LEADER  
    Happy he, on the weary sea  
Who bath fled the tempest and won the haven.  
Happy whoso bath risen, free,  
Above his striving. For strangely graven  
Is the orb of life, that one and another  
In gold and power may outpass his brother.  
And men in their millions float and flow  
And seethe with a million hopes as leaven;  
And they win their Will, or they miss their Will,  
And the hopes are dead or are pined for still;  
But whoe’er can know,  
As the long days go,  
That To Live is happy, bath found his Heaven\!  
*Re-enter* DIONYSUS, *from the Castle*

 

DIONYSUS  
O eye that cravest sights thou must not see,  
O heart athirst for that which slakes not\! Thee,  
Pentheus, I call; forth and be seen, in guise  
Of woman, Maenad, saint of Dionyse,  
To spy upon His Chosen and thine own  
Mother\!  \[*Enter* PENTHEUS, *clad like a Bacchanal, and strangely excited, a spirit of Bacchic madness overshadowing him.*  
Thy shape, methinks, is like to one  
Of Cadmus’ royal maids\!

 

PENTHEUS  
                        Yea; and mine eye  
Is bright\! Yon sun shines twofold in the sky,  
Thebes twofold and the Wall of Seven Gates….  
And is it a Wild Bull this, that walks and waits  
Before me? There are horns upon thy brow\!  
What art thou, man or beast\! For surely now  
The Bull is on thee\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                      He who erst was wrath,  
Goes with us now in gentleness. He hath  
Unsealed thine eyes to see what thou shouldst see

 

PENTHEUS  
Say; stand I not as Ino stands, or she  
Who bore me?

 

DIONYSUS  
              When I look on thee, it seems  
I see their very selves\! — But stay; why streams  
That lock abroad, not where I laid it, crossed  
Under the coif?

 

PENTHEUS  
                I did it, as I tossed  
My head in dancing, to and fro, and cried  
His holy music\!

 

DIONYSUS \(*tending him*\)  
                It shall soon be tied  
Aright. ’Tis mine to tend thee…. Nay, but stand  
With head straight.

 

PENTHEUS  
                    In the hollow of thine hand  
I lay me. Deck me as thou wilt.

 

DIONYSUS  
                                Thy zone  
Is loosened likewise; and the folded gown  
Not evenly falling to the feet.

 

PENTHEUS  
                                ’Tis so,  
By the right foot. But here methinks, they flow  
In one straight line to the heel.

 

DIONYSUS \(*while tending him*\)  
                                  And if thou prove  
Their madness true, aye, more than true, what love  
And thanks hast thou for me?

 

PENTHEUS \(*not listening to him*\)  
                              In my right hand  
Is it, or thus, that I should bear the wand,  
To be most like to them?

 

DIONYSUS  
                          Up let it swing  
In the right hand, timed with the right foot’s spring….  
’Tis well thy heart is changed\!

 

PENTHEUS \(*more wildly*\)  
                                What strength is this\!  
Kithaeron’s steeps and all that in them is —   
How say’st thou? — Could my shoulders lift the whole?

 

DIONYSUS  
Surely thou canst, and if thou wilt\! Thy soul,  
Being once so sick, now stands as it should stand.

 

PENTHEUS  
Shall it be bars of iron? Or this bare hand  
And shoulder to the crags, to wrench them down?

 

DIONYSUS  
Wouldst wreck the Nymphs’ wild temples, and the brown  
Rocks, where Pan pipes at noonday?

 

PENTHEUS  
                                    Nay; not I\!  
Force is not well with women. I will lie  
Hid in the pine-brake.

 

DIONYSUS  
                        Even as fits a spy  
On holy and fearful things, so shalt thou lie\!

 

PENTHEUS \(*with a laugh*\)  
They lie there now, methinks — the wild birds, caught  
By love among the leaves, and fluttering not\!

 

DIONYSUS  
It may be. That is what thou goest to see,  
Aye, and to trap them — so they trap not thee I

 

PENTHEUS  
Forth through the Thebans’ town\! I am their king,  
Aye, their one Man, seeing I dare this thing\!

 

DIONYSUS  
Yea, thou shalt hear their burden, thou alone;  
Therefore thy trial awaiteth thee\! — But on;  
With me into thine ambush shalt thou come  
Unscathed; then let another bear thee home\!

 

PENTHEUS  
The Queen, my mother.

 

DIONYSUS  
                      Marked of every eye.

 

PENTHEUS  
For that I go\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                Thou shalt be borne on high I

 

PENTHEUS  
That were like pride\!

 

DIONYSUS  
                      Thy mother’s hands shall share  
Thy carrying.

 

PENTHEUS  
              Nay; I need not such soft care\!

 

DIONYSUS  
So soft?

 

PENTHEUS  
          Whate’er it be, I have earned it well\!  \[*Exit* PENTHEUS *towards the Mountain.*

 

DIONYSUS  
Fell, fell art thou; and to a doom so fell  
Thou walkest, that thy name from South to North  
Shall shine, a sign for ever\! — Reach thou forth  
Thine arms, Agâvê, now, and ye dark-browed  
Cadmeian sisters\! Greet this prince so proud  
To the high ordeal, where save God and me,  
None walks unscathed\! — The rest this day shall see.  \[*Exit* DIONYSUS *following* PENTHEUS.

 

CHORUS  
*Some Maidens*  
O hounds raging and blind,  
Up by the mountain road,  
Sprites of the maddened mind,  
To the wild Maids of God;  
Fill with your rage their eyes,  
Rage at the rage unblest,  
Watching in woman’s guise,  
The spy upon God’s Possessed.

 

*A Bacchanal*  
Who shall be first, to mark  
Eyes in the rock that spy,  
Eyes in the pine-tree dark —   
Is it his mother? — and cry:  
“Lo, what is this that comes,  
Haunting, troubling still,  
Even in our heights, our homes,  
The wild Maids of the Hill?  
What flesh hare this child?  
Never on woman’s breast  
Changeling so evil smiled;  
Man is he not, but Beast\!  
Loin-shape of the wild,  
Gorgon-breed of the waste\!”  
*All the Chorus*  
        Hither, for doom and deed\!  
Hither with lifted sword,  
Justice, Wrath of the Lord,  
Come in our visible need\!  
Smite till the throat shall bleed,  
Smite till the heart shall bleed,  
Him the tyrannous, lawless, Godless, Echîon’s earth-born seed\!  
*Other Maidens*  
Tyrannously hath he trod;  
Marched him, in Law’s despite,  
Against thy Light, O God,  
Yea, and thy Mother’s Light;  
Girded him, falsely bold,  
Blinded in craft, to quell  
And by man’s violence hold  
Things unconquerable

 

*A Bacchanal*  
A strait pitiless mind  
Is death unto godliness;  
And to feel in human kind  
Life, and a pain the less.  
Knowledge, we are not foes\!  
I seek thee diligently;  
But the world with a great wind blows,  
Shining, and not from thee;  
Blowing to beautiful things,  
On, amid dark and light,  
Till Life, through the trammellings  
Of Laws that are not the Right,  
Breaks, clean and pure, and sings  
Glorying to God in the height\!  
*All the Chorus*  
        Hither for doom and deed\!  
Hither with lifted sword,  
Justice, Wrath of the Lord,  
Come in our visible need\!  
Smite till the throat shall bleed,  
Smite till the heart shall bleed,  
Him the tyrannous, lawless, Godless, Echîon’s earth born seed\!

 

LEADER  
Appear, appear, whatso thy shape or name

 

O Mountain Bull, Snake of the Hundred Heads,  
Lion of Burning Flame\!

 

O God, Beast, Mystery, come\! Thy mystic maids  
Are hunted\! — Blast their hunter with thy breath,  
Cast o’er his head thy snare;  
And laugh aloud and drag him to his death,  
Who stalks thy herded madness in its lair\!  
*Enter hastily a* MESSENGER *from the Mountain, pale and distraught.*

 

MESSENGER  
Woe to the house once blest in Hellas\! Woe  
To thee, old King Sidonian, who didst sow  
The dragon-seed on Ares’ bloody lea\!  
Alas, even thy slaves must weep for thee\!

 

LEADER  
News from the mountain? — Speak\! How hath it sped?

 

MESSENGER  
Pentheus, my king, Echîon’s son, is dead\!

 

LEADER  
          All hail, God of the Voice,  
Manifest ever more\!

 

MESSENGER  
What say’st thou? — And how strange thy tone, as though  
In joy at this my master’s overthrow\!

 

LEADER  
        With fierce Joy I rejoice,  
Child of a savage shore;  
For the chains of my prison are broken, and the dread where I cowered of yore\!

 

MESSENGER  
And deem’st thou Thebes so beggared, so forlorn  
Of manhood, as to sit beneath thy scorn?

 

LEADER  
      Thebes bath o’er me no sway\!  
None save Him I obey,  
Dionysus, Child of the Highest, Him I obey and adore\!

 

MESSENGER  
One can forgive thee\! — Yet ’tis no fair thing,  
Maids, to rejoice in a man’s suffering.

 

LEADER  
      Speak of the mountain side\!  
Tell us the doom he died,  
The sinner smitten to death, even where his sin was sore\!

 

MESSENGER  
We climbed beyond the utmost habitings  
Of Theban shepherds, passed Asopus’ springs,  
And struck into the land of rock on dim  
Kithaeron — Pentheus, and, attending him,  
I, and the Stranger who should guide our way,  
Then first in a green dell we stopped, and lay,  
Lips dumb and feet unmoving, warily  
Watching, to be unseen and yet to see.  
A narrow glen it was, by crags o’ertowered,  
Torn through by tossing waters, and there lowered  
A shadow of great pines over it. And there  
The Maenad maidens sate; in toil they were,  
Busily glad. Some with an ivy chain  
Tricked a worn wand to toss its locks again;  
Some, wild in joyance, like young steeds set free,  
Made answering songs of mystic melody.  
But my poor master saw not the great band  
Before him. “Stranger,” he cried, “where we stand  
Mine eyes can reach not these false saints of thine.  
Mount we the bank, or some high-shouldered pine,  
And I shall see their follies clear\!” At that  
There came a marvel. For the Stranger straight  
Touched a great pine-tree’s high and heavenward crown,  
And lower, lower, lower, urged it down  
To the herbless floor. Round like a bending bow,  
Or slow wheel’s rim a joiner forces to,  
So in those hands that tough and mountain stem  
Bowed slow — oh, strength not mortal dwelt in them\! —   
To the very earth. And there he set the King,  
And slowly, lest it cast him in its spring,  
Let back the young and straining tree, till high  
It towered again amid the towering sky;  
And Pentheus in the branches\! Well, I ween,  
He saw the Maenads then, and well was seen\!  
For scarce was he aloft, when suddenly  
There was no stranger any more with me,  
But out of Heaven a Voice — oh, what voice else? —   
’Twas He that called\! “Behold, O damosels,  
I bring ye him who turneth to despite  
Both me and ye, and darkeneth my great Light.  
’Tis yours to avenge\!” So spake he, and there came  
‘Twixt earth and sky a pillar of high flame.  
And silence took the air, and no leaf stirred  
In all the forest dell. Thou hadst not heard  
In that vast silence any wild things’s cry.  
And up they sprang; but with bewildered eye,  
Agaze and listening, scarce yet hearing true.  
Then came the Voice again. And when they knew  
Their God’s clear call, old Cadmus’ royal brood,  
Up, like wild pigeons startled in a wood,  
On flying feet they came, his mother blind,  
Agâvê, and her sisters, and behind  
All the wild crowd, more deeply maddened then,  
Through the angry rocks and torrent-tossing glen,  
Until they spied him in the dark pine-tree:  
Then climbed a crag hard by and furiously  
Some sought to stone him, some their wands would fling  
Lance-wise aloft, in cruel targeting.  
But none could strike. The height o’ertopped their rage,  
And there he clung, unscathed, as in a cage  
Caught. And of all their strife no end was found.  
Then, “Hither,” cried Agâvê; “stand we round  
And grip the stem, my Wild Ones, till we take  
This climbing cat-o’-the-mount\! He shall not make  
A tale of God’s high dances\!” Out then shone  
Arm upon arm, past count, and closed upon  
The pine, and gripped; and the ground gave, and down  
It reeled. And that high sitter from the crown  
Of the green pine-top, with a shrieking cry  
Fell, as his mind grew clear, and there hard by  
Was horror visible. ’Twas his mother stood  
O’er him, first priestess of those rites of blood.  
He tore the coif, and from his head away  
Flung it, that she might know him, and not slay  
To her own misery. He touched the wild  
Cheek, crying: “Mother, it is I, thy child,  
Thy Pentheus, born thee in Echîon’s hall\!  
Have mercy, Mother\! Let it not befall  
Through sin of mine, that thou shouldst slay thy son\!”  
But she, with lips a-foam and eyes that run  
Like leaping fire, with thoughts that ne’er should be  
On earth, possessed by Bacchios utterly,  
Stays not nor hears. Round his left arm she put  
Both hands, set hard against his side her foot,  
Drew … and the shoulder severed\! — not by might  
Of arm, but easily, as the God made light  
Her hand’s essay. And at the other side  
Was Ino rending; and the torn flesh cried,  
And on Autonoë pressed, and all the crowd  
Of ravening arms. Yea, all the air was loud  
With groans that faded into sobbing breath,  
Dim shrieks, and joy, and triumph-cries of death.  
And here was borne a severed arm, and there  
A hunter’s hooted foot; white bones lay bare  
With rending; and swift hands ensanguinèd  
Tossed as in sport the flesh of Pentheus dead.  
His body lies afar. The precipice  
Hath part, and parts in many an interstice  
Lurk of the tangled woodland — no light quest  
To find. And, ah, the head\! Of all the rest,  
His mother hath it, pierced upon a wand,  
As one might pierce a lion’s, and through the land,  
Leaving her sisters in their dancing place,  
Bears it on high\! Yea, to these walls her face  
Was set, exulting in her deed of blood,  
Calling upon her Bromios, her God,  
Her Comrade, Fellow-Render of the Prey,  
Her All-Victorious, to whom this day  
She bears in triumph … her own broken heart\!  
For me, after that sight, I will depart  
Before Agâvê comes. — Oh, to fulfil  
God’s laws, and have no thought beyond His will,  
Is man’s hest treasure. Aye, and wisdom true,  
Methinks, for things of dust to cleave unto\!  \[*The* MESSENGER *departs into the Castle.*

 

CHORUS  
*Some Maidens*  
Weave ye the dance, and call  
Praise to God\!  
Bless ye the Tyrant’s fall\!  
Down is trod  
Pentheus, the Dragon’s Seed\!  
Wore he the woman’s weed?  
Clasped he his death indeed,  
Clasped the rod?

 

*A Bacchanal*  
Yea, the wild ivy lapt him, and the doomed  
Wild Bull of Sacrifice before him loomed\!  
*Others*  
Ye who did Bromios scorn,  
Praise Him the more,  
Bacchanals, Cadmus-born;  
Praise with sore  
Agony, yea, with tears\!  
Great are the gifts he bears\!  
Hands that a mother rears  
Red with gore\!

 

LEADER  
But stay, Agâvê cometh\! And her eyes  
Make fire around her, reeling\! Ho, the prize  
Cometh\! All hail, O Rout of Dionyse\!  \[*Enter from the Mountain* AGAVE, *mad, and to all seeming wondrously happy, bearing the head of* PENTHEUS *in her hand. The* CHORUS MAIDENS *stand horror-struck at the sight; the* LEADER, *also* *horror-struck, strives to accept it and rejoice in it as the God’s deed.*

 

AGAVE

 

Ye from the lands of Morn\!

 

LEADER  
  Call me not; I give praise\!

 

AGAVE

 

Lo, from the trunk new-shorn  
Hither a Mountain Thorn  
Bear we\! O Asia-born  
Baechanals, bless this chase\!

 

LEADER  
I see. Yea; I see.  
Have I not welcomed thee?

 

AGAVE \(*very calmly and peacefully*\)  
He was young in the wildwood:  
Without nets I caught him\!  
Nay; look without fear on  
The Lion; I have ta’en him\!

 

LEADER  
Where in the wildwood?  
Whence have ye brought him?

 

AGAVE

 

    Kithaeron…

 

LEADER  
                  Kithaeron?

 

AGAVE

 

The Mountain hath slain him\!

 

LEADER  
Who first came nigh him?

 

AGAVE

 

  I, I, ’tis confessèd\!  
And they named me there by him  
Agâvê the Blessèd\!

 

LEADER  
Who was next in the hand on him?

 

AGAVE

 

The daughters….

 

LEADER  
                  The daughters?

 

AGAVE

 

Of Cadmus laid hand on him.  
But the swift hand that slaughters  
Is mine; mine is the praise\!  
Bless ye this day of days\!  \[*The* LEADER *tries to speak, but is not able;* AGAVE *begins gently stroking the head.*

 

AGAVE

 

Gather ye now to the feast\!

 

LEADER  
Feast\! — O miserable\!

 

AGAVE

 

See, it falls to his breast,  
Curling and gently tressed,  
The hair of the Wild Bull’s crest —   
The young steer of the fell\!

 

LEADER  
Most like a beast of the wild  
That head, those lacks defiled.

 

AGAVE \(*lifting up the head, more excitedly*\)  
He wakened his Mad Ones,

 

A Chase-God, a wise God\!  
He sprang them to seize this\!  
He preys where his band preys.

 

LEADER \(*brooding, with horror*\)  
In the trail of thy Mad Ones  
Thou tearest thy prize, God\!

 

AGAVE

 

  Dost praise it?

 

LEADER  
                  I praise this?

 

AGAVE

 

      Ah, soon shall the land praise\!

 

LEADER  
And Pentheus, O Mother,  
Thy child?

 

AGAVE

 

              He shall cry on  
My name as none other,  
Bless the spoils of the Lion\!

 

LEADER  
Aye, strange is thy treasure\!

 

AGAVE

 

And strange was the taking\!

 

LEADER  
  Thou art glad?

 

AGAVE

 

                  Beyond measure;  
Yea, glad in the breaking  
Of dawn upon all this land,  
By the prize, the prize of my hand\!

 

LEADER  
Show them to all the land, unhappy one,  
The trophy of this deed that thou hast done\!

 

AGAVE

 

Ho, all ye men that round the citadel  
And shining towers of ancient Thêbê dwell,  
Come\! Look upon this prize, this lion’s spoil,  
That we have taken — yea, with our own toil,  
We, Cadmus’ daughters\! Not with leathern-set  
Thessalian javelins, not with hunter’s net,  
Only white arms and swift hands’ bladed fall.  
Why make ye much ado, and boast withal  
Your armourers’ engines? See, these palms were bare  
That caught the angry beast, and held, and tare  
The limbs of him\!… Father\!… Go, bring to me  
My father\!… Aye, and Pentheus, where is he,  
My son? He shall set up a ladder-stair  
Against this house, and in the triglyphs there  
Nail me this lion’s head, that gloriously  
I bring ye, having slain him — I, even I\!  \[*She goes through the crowd towards the Castle, showing the head and looking for a place to hang it. Enter from the Mountain* CADMUS, *with attendants, bearing the body of* PENTHEUS *on a bier.*

 

CADMUS  
On, with your awful burden. Follow me,  
Thralls, to his house, whose body grievously  
With many a weary search at last in dim  
Kithaeron’s glens I found, torn limb from limb,  
And through the intervening forest weed  
Scattered. — Men told me of my daughters’ deed,  
When I was just returned within these walls,  
With grey Teiresias, from the Bacchanals.  
And back I hied me to the hills again  
To seek my murdered son. There saw I plain  
Actaeon’s mother, ranging where he died,  
Autonoë; and Ino by her side,  
Wandering ghastly in the pine-copses.  
Agâvê was not there. The rumour is  
She cometh fleet-foot hither. — Ah\! ’Tis true;  
A sight I scarce can bend mine eyes unto.

 

AGAVE

 

\(*turning from the Palace and seeing him*\)  
My father, a great boast is thine this hour.  
Thou hast begotten daughters, high in power  
And valiant above all mankind — yea, all  
Valiant, though none like me\! I have let fall  
The shuttle by the loom, and raised my hand  
For higher things, to slay from out thy land  
Wild beasts\! See, in mine arms I hear the prize,  
That nailed above these portals it may rise  
To show what things thy daughters did\! Do thou  
Take it, and call a feast. Proud art thou now  
And highly favoured in our valiancy\!

 

CADMUS  
O depth of grief, how can I fathom thee  
Or look upon thee\! — Poor, poor bloodstained hand\!  
Poor sisters\! — A fair sacrifice to stand  
Before God’s altars, daughter; yea, and call  
Me and my citizens to feast withal\!  
Nay, let me weep — for thine affliction most,  
Then for mine own. All, all of us are lost,  
Not wrongfully, yet is it hard, from one  
Who might have loved — our Bromios, our own\!

 

AGAVE

 

How crabbèd and how scowling in the eyes  
Is man’s old age\! — Would that my son likewise  
Were happy of his hunting, in my way  
When with his warrior hands he will essay  
The wild beast\! — Nay, his valiance is to fight  
With God’s will\! Father, thou shouldst set him right…..  
Will no one bring him thither, that mine eyes  
May look on his, and show him this my prize\!

 

CADMUS  
Alas, if ever ye can know again  
The truth of what ye did, what pain of pain  
That truth shall bring\! Or were it best to wait  
Darkened for evermore, and deem your state  
Not misery, though ye know no happiness?

 

AGAVE

 

What seest thou here to chide, or not to bless?

 

CADMUS \(*after hesitation, resolving himself*\)  
Raise me thine eyes to yon blue dome of air\!

 

AGAVE

 

’Tis done. What dost thou bid me seek for there?

 

CADMUS  
Is it the same, or changèd in thy sight?

 

AGAVE

 

More shining than before, more heavenly bright\!

 

CADMUS  
And that wild tremour, is it with thee still?

 

AGAVE \(*troubled*\)  
I know not what thou sayest; but my will  
Clears, and some change cometh, I know not how.

 

CADMUS  
Caust hearken then, being changed, and answer Dow\!

 

AGAVE

 

I have forgotten something; else I could.

 

CADMUS  
What husband led thee of old from mine abode?

 

AGAVE

 

Echîon, whom men named the Child of Earth.

 

CADMUS  
And what child in Echîon’s house had birth?

 

AGAVE

 

Pentheus, of my love and his father’s bred.

 

CADMUS  
Thou bearest in thine arms an head-what head?

 

AGAVE \(*beginning to tremble, and not looking at what she carries*\)  
A lion’s — so they all said in the chase.

 

CADMUS  
Turn to it now— ’tis no long toil — and gaze.

 

AGAVE

 

Ah\! But what is it? What am I carrying here?

 

CADMUS  
Look once upon it full, till all be clear\!

 

AGAVE

 

I see … most deadly pain\! Oh, woe is me\!

 

CADMUS  
Wears it the likeness of a lion to thee?

 

AGAVE

 

No; ’tis the head — O God\! — of Pentheus, this\!

 

CADMUS  
Blood-drenched ere thou wouldst know him\! Aye ’tis his.

 

AGAVE

 

Who slew him? — How came I to hold this thing?

 

CADMUS  
O cruel Truth, is this thine home-coming?

 

AGAVE

 

Answer\! My heart is hanging on thy breath\!

 

CADMUS  
’Twas thou. — Thou and thy sisters wrought his death.

 

AGAVE

 

In what place was it? His own house, or where?

 

CADMUS  
Where the dogs tore Actaeon, even there.

 

AGAVE

 

Why went he to Kithaeron? What sought he?

 

CADMUS  
To mock the God and thine own ecstasy.

 

AGAVE

 

But how should we he on the hills this day?

 

CADMUS  
Being mad\! A spirit drove all the land that way.

 

CADMUS  
’Tis Dionyse hath done it\! Now I see.

 

CADMUS \(*earnestly*\)  
Ye wronged Him\! Ye denied his deity\!

 

AGAVE \(*turning from him*\)  
Show me the body of the son I love\!

 

CADMUS \(*leading her to the bier*\)  
’Tis here, my child. Hard was the quest thereof.

 

AGAVE

 

Laid in due state?  \[*As there is no answer, she lifts the veil of the bier, and sees.*  
       Oh, if I wrought a sin,  
’Twas mine\! What portion had my child therein\!

 

CADMUS  
He made him like to you, adoring not  
The God; who therefore to one bane hath brought  
You and this body, wrecking all our line,  
And me. Aye, no man-child was ever mine;  
And now this first-fruit of the flesh of thee,  
Sad woman, foully here and frightfully  
Lies murdered\! Whom the house looked up unto,  \[*Kneeling by the body.*

 

O Child, my daughter’s child\! who heldest true  
My castle walls; and to the folk a name  
Of fear thou wast; and no man sought to shame  
My grey beard, when they knew that thou wast there,  
Else had they swift reward\! — And now I fare  
Forth in dishonour, outcast, I, the great  
Cadmus, who sowed the seed-rows of this state  
Of Thebes, and reaped the harvest wonderful.  
O my belovèd, though thy heart is dull  
In death, O still belovèd, and alway  
Beloved\! Never more, then, shalt thou lay  
Thine hand to this white heard, and speak to me  
Thy “Mother’s Father”; ask “Who wrongeth thee?  
Who stints thine honour, or with malice stirs  
Thine heart? Speak, and I smite thine injurers\!”  
But now — woe, woe, to me and thee also,  
Woe to thy mother and her sisters, woe  
Alway\! Oh, whoso walketh not in dread  
Of Gods, let him but look on this man dead\!

 

LEADER  
Lo, I weep with thee. ’Twas but due reward  
God sent on Pentheus; but for thee… ’Tis hard.

 

AGAVE

 

My father, thou canst see the change in me,

  \[*A page or more has here been torn out of the MS. from which all our copies of “The Bacchæ” are derived. It evidently contained a speech of Agâvê* \(*followed presumably by some words of the Chorus*\), *and* *an appearance of* DIONYSUS *upon a cloud. He must have pronounced judgment upon the Thebans in general, and especially upon the daughters of* CADMUS, *have justified his own action, and declared his determination to establish his godhead. Where the MS. begins again, we find him addressing* CADMUS.\]

DIONYSUS  
      ·        ·        ·        ·        ·  
      ·        ·        ·        ·        ·  
And tell of Time, what gifts for thee he bears,  
What griefs and wonders in the winding years.  
For thou must change and be a Serpent Thing  
Strange, and beside thee she whom thou didst bring  
Of old to be thy bride from Heaven afar,  
Harmonia, daughter of the Lord of War.  
Yea, and a chariot of kine — so spake  
The word of Zeus — thee and thy Queen shall take  
Through many lands, Lord of a wild array  
Of orient spears. And many towns shall they  
Destroy beneath thee, that vast horde, until  
They touch Apollo’s dwelling, and fulfil  
Their doom, back driven on stormy ways and steep.  
Thee only and thy spouse shall Ares keep,  
And save alive to the Islands of the Blest.  
Thus speaketh Dionysus, Son confessed  
Of no man but of Zeus\! — Ah, had ye seen  
Truth in the hour ye would not, all had been  
Well with ye, and the Child of God your friend\!

 

AGAVE

 

Dionysus, we beseech thee\! We have sinned\!

 

DIONYSUS  
Too late\! When there was time, ye knew me not\!

 

AGAVE

 

We have confessed. Yet is thine hand too hot.

 

DIONYSUS  
Ye mocked me, being God; this your wage.

 

AGAVE

 

Should God be like a proud man in his rage?

 

DIONYSUS  
’Tis as my sire, Zeus, willed it long ago.

 

AGAVE \(*turning from him almost with disdain*\)  
Old man, the word is spoken; we must go.

 

DIONYSUS  
And seeing ye must, what is it that ye wait?

 

CADMUS  
Child, we are come into a deadly strait,  
All; thou, poor sufferer, and thy sisters twain,  
And my sad self. Far off to barbarous men,  
A grey-haired wanderer, I must take my road.  
And then the oracle, the doom of God,  
That I must lead a raging horde far-flown  
To prey on Hellas; lead my spouse, mine own  
Harmonia, Ares’ child, discorporate  
And haunting forms, dragon and dragon-mate,  
Against the tombs and altar-stones of Greece,  
Lance upon lance behind us; and not cease  
From toils, like other men, nor dream, nor past  
The foam of Acheron find my peace at last.

 

AGAVE

 

Father\! And I must wander far from thee\!

 

CADMUS

 

O Child, why wilt thou reach thine arms to me,  
As yearns the milk-white swan, when old swans die?

 

AGAVE

 

Where shall I turn me else? No home have I

 

CADMUS  
I know not; I can help thee not.

 

AGAVE

 

    Farewell, O home, O ancient tower\!  
Lo, I am outcast from my bower,  
And leave ye for a worser lot.

 

CADMUS  
Go forth, go forth to misery,  
The way Actaeon’s father went\!

 

AGAVE

 

    Father, for thee my tears are spent.

 

CADMUS  
Nay, Child, ’tis I must weep for thee;  
For thee and for thy sisters twain\!

 

AGAVE

 

    On all this house, in bitter wise,  
Our Lord and Master, Dionyse,  
Hath poured the utter dregs of pain\!

 

DIONYSUS  
In bitter wise, for bitter was the shame  
Ye did me, when Thebes honoured not my name.

 

AGAVE

 

Then lead me where my sisters be;  
Together let our tears be shed,  
Our ways be wandered; where no red  
Kithaeron waits to gaze on me;  
Nor I gaze back; no thyrsus stem,  
Nor song, nor memory in the air.  
Oh, other Bacchanals be there,  
Not I, not I, to dream of them\!  \[AGAVE *with her group of attendants goes out on the side away from the Mountain.* DIONYSUS *rises upon the Cloud and disappears.*

 

CHORUS  
There may he many shapes of mystery,  
And many things God makes to be,  
Past hope or fear.  
And the end men looked for cometh not,  
And a path is there where no man thought.  
So hath it fallen here.  \[*Exeunt.*

## **INTRODUCTORY NOTE**

ARISTOPHANES, THE GREATEST of comic writers in Greek and, in the opinion of many, in any language, is the only one of the Attic comedians any of whose works has survived in complete form. He was born in Athens about the middle of the fifth century B. C., and had his first comedy produced when he was so young that his name was withheld on account of his youth. He is credited with over forty plays, eleven of which survive, along with the names and fragments of some twenty-six others. His satire deals with political, religious, and literary topics, and with all its humor and fancy is evidently the outcome of profound conviction and a genuine patriotism. The Attic comedy was produced at the festivals of Dionysus, which were marked by great license, and to this, rather than to the individual taste of the poet, must be ascribed the undoubted coarseness of many of the jests. Aristophanes seems, indeed, to have been regarded by his contemporaries as a man of noble character. He died shortly after the production of his “Plutus,” in 388 B. C.

“The Frogs” was produced the year after the death of Euripides, and laments the decay of Greek tragedy which Aristophanes attributed to that writer. It is an admirable example of the brilliance of his style, and of that mingling of wit and poetry with rollicking humor and keen satirical point which is his chief characteristic. Here, as elsewhere, he stands for tradition against innovation of all kinds, whether in politics, religion, or art. The hostility to Euripides displayed here and in several other plays, like his attacks on Socrates, is a result of this attitude of conservatism. The present play is notable also as a piece of elaborate if not over-serious literary criticism from the pen of a great poet.

XANTHIAS.  SHALL I crack any of those old jokes, master,  
At which the audience never fail to laugh?

 

DIONYSUS.  Aye, what you will, except *I’m getting crushed:*  
Fight shy of that: I’m sick of that already.

 

XAN.  Nothing else smart?

 

DIO.  Aye, save *my shoulder’s aching.*

 

XAN.  Come now, that comical joke?

 

DIO.  With all my heart.  
Only be careful not to shift your pole.  
And — XAN. What?  DIO. And vow that you’ve a belly-ache.

 

XAN.  May I not say I’m overburdened so  
That if none ease me, I must ease myself?

 

DIO.  For mercy’s sake, not till I’m going to vomit.

 

XAN.  What\! must I bear these burdens, and not make  
One of the jokes Ameipsias and Lycis  
And Phrynichus, in every play they write,  
Put in the mouths of all their burden-bearers?

 

DIO.  Don’t make them; no\! I tell you when I see  
Their plays, and hear those jokes, I come away  
More than a twelvemonth older than I went.

 

XAN.  O, thrice unlucky neck of mine, which now  
Is *getting crushed,* yet must not crack its joke\!

 

DIO.  Now is not this fine pampered insolence  
When I myself, Dionysus, son of — Pipkin,  
Toil on afoot, and let this fellow ride,  
Taking no trouble, and no burden bearing?

 

XAN.  What, don’t I bear?  DIO. How can you when you’re riding?

 

XAN.  Why, I bear these.  DIO. How?  XAN. Most unwillingly.

 

DIO.  Does not the donkey bear the load you’re bearing?

 

XAN.  Not what I bear myself: by Zeus, not he.

 

DIO.  How can you bear, when you are borne yourself?

 

XAN.  Don’t know: but anyhow *my shoulder’s aching.*

 

DIO.  Then since you say the donkey helps you not,  
You lift him up and carry him in turn.

 

XAN.  O, hang it all\! why didn’t I fight at sea?  
You should have smarted bitterly for this.

 

DIO.  Get down, you rascal; I’ve been trudging on  
Till now I’ve reached the portal, where I’m going  
First to turn in. Boy\! Boy\! I say there, Boy\!

 

HERACLES. Who banged the door? How like a prancing Centaur  
He drove against it\! Mercy o’ me, what’s this?

 

DIO.  Boy.  XAN. Yes.  DIO. Did you observe?  XAN. What?  DIO. How alarmed  
He is.  XAN. Aye, truly, lest you’ve lost your wits.

 

HER.  O, by Demeter, I can’t choose but laugh.  
Biting my lips won’t stop me. Ha\! ha\! ha\!

 

DIO.  Pray you, come hither, I have need of you.

 

HER.  I vow I can’t help laughing, I can’t help it.  
A lion’s hide upon a yellow silk,  
A club and buskin\! What’s it all about?  
Where were you going?  DIO. I was serving lately  
Aboard the — Cleisthenes.  HER. And fought?  DIO. And sank  
More than a dozen of the enemy’s ships.

 

HER.  You two?  DIO. We two.  HER. And then I awoke, and lo\!

 

DIO.  There as, on deck, I’m reading to myself  
The “Andromeda,” a sudden pang of longing  
Shoots through my heart, you can’t conceive how keenly.

 

HER.  How big a pang?  DIO. A small one, Molon’s size.

 

HER.  Caused by a woman?  DIO. No.  HER. A boy?  DIO. No, no.

 

HER.  A man?  DIO. Ah\! ah\!  HER. Was it for Cleisthenes?

 

DIO.  Don’t mock me, brother; on my life I am  
In a bad way: such fierce desire consumes me.

 

HER.  Aye, little brother? how?  DIO. I can’t describe it.  
But yet I’ll tell you in a riddling way.  
Have you e’er felt a sudden lust for soup?

 

HER.  Soup\! Zeus-a-mercy, yes, ten thousand times.

 

DIO.  Is the thing clear, or must I speak again?

 

HER.  Not of the soup: I’m clear about the soup.

 

DIO.  Well, just that sort of pang devours my heart  
For lost Euripides.  HER. A dead man too.

 

DIO.  And no one shall persuade me not to go  
After the man.  HER. Do you mean below, to Hades?

 

DIO.  And lower still, if there’s a lower still.

 

HER.  What on earth for?  DIO. I want a genuine poet,  
“For some are not, and those that are, are bad.”

 

HER.  What\! does not Iophon live?  DIO. Well, he’s the sole  
Good thing remaining, if even he is good.  
For even of that I’m not exactly certain.

 

HER.  If go you must, there’s Sophocles — he comes  
Before Euripides — why not take *him?*

 

DIO.  Not till I’ve tried if Iophon’s coin rings true  
When he’s alone, apart from Sophocles.  
Besides, Euripides, the crafty rogue,  
Will find a thousand shifts to get away,  
But *he* was easy here, is easy there.

 

HER.  But Agathon, where is he?  DIO. He has gone and left us.  
A genial poet, by his friends much missed.

 

HER.  Gone where?  DIO. To join the blessed in their banquets.

 

HER.  But what of Xenocles?  DIO. O, he be hanged\!

 

HER.  Pythangelus?  XAN. But never a word of me,  
Not though my shoulder’s chafed so terribly.

 

HER.  But have you not a shoal of little songsters,  
Tragedians by the myriad, who can chatter  
A furlong faster than Euripides?

 

DIO.  Those be mere vintage-leavings, jabberers, choirs  
Of swallow-broods, degraders of their art,  
Who get one chorus, and are seen no more,  
The Muses’ love once gained. But, O my friend,  
Search where you will, you’ll never find a true  
Creative genius, uttering startling things.

 

HER.  Creative? how do you mean?  DIO. I mean a man  
Who’ll dare some novel venturesome conceit,  
*Air, Zeus’ chamber,* or *Time’s foot,* or this:  
*’Twas not my mind that swore: my tongue committed*  
*A little perjury on its own account.*

 

HER.  You like that style?  DIO. Like it? I dote upon it.

 

HER.  I vow it’s ribald nonsense, and you know it.

 

DIO.  “Rule not my mind”: you’ve got a house to mind.

 

HER.  Really and truly, though, ’tis paltry stuff.

 

DIO.  Teach me to dine\!  XAN. But never a word of me.

 

DIO.  But tell me truly— ’twas for this I came  
Dressed up to mimic you — what friends received  
And entertained you when you went below  
To bring back Cerberus, in case I need them.  
And tell me too the havens, fountains, shops,  
Roads, resting-places, stews, refreshment rooms,  
Towns, lodgings, hostesses, with whom were found  
The fewest bugs.  XAN. But never a word of me.

 

HER.  You are really game to go?

 

DIO.  O, drop that, can’t you?  
And tell me this: of all the roads you know,  
Which is the quickest way to get to Hades?  
I want one not too warm, nor yet too cold.

 

HER.  Which shall I tell you first? which shall it be?  
There’s one by rope and bench: you launch away  
And — hang yourself.  DIO. No, thank you: that’s too stifling.

 

HER.  Then there’s a track, a short and beaten cut,  
By pestle and mortar.  DIO. Hemlock, do you mean?

 

HER.  Just so.  DIO. No, that’s too deathly cold a way;  
You have hardly started ere your shins get numbed.

 

HER.  Well, would you like a steep and swift descent?

 

DIO.  Aye, that’s the style: my walking powers are small.

 

HER.  Go down to the Cerameicus.  DIO. And do what?

 

HER.  Climb to the tower’s top pinnacle — DIO. And then?

 

HER.  Observe the torch-race started, and when all  
The multitude is shouting *Let them go,*  
Let yourself go.  DIO. Go whither?  HER. To the ground.

 

DIO.  O, that would break my brain’s two envelopes.  
I’ll not try that.  HER. Which *will* you try?  DIO. The way  
You went yourself.  HER. A parlous voyage that,  
For first you’ll come to an enormous lake  
Of fathomless depth.  DIO. And how and I to cross?

 

HER.  An ancient mariner will row you over  
In a wee boat, so big. The fare’s two obols.

 

DIO.  Fie\! The power two obols have, the whole world through\!  
How came they thither?  HER. Theseus took them down.  
And next you’ll see great snakes and savage monsters  
In tens of thousands.  DIO. You needn’t try to scare me,  
I’m going to go.  HER. Then weltering seas of filth  
And ever-rippling dung: and plunged therein,  
Whoso has wronged the stranger here on earth,  
Or robbed his boylove of the promised pay,  
Or swinged his mother, or profanely smitten  
His father’s cheek, or sworn an oath forsworn,  
Or copied out a speech of Morsimus.

 

DIO.  There too, perdie, should *he* be plunged, whoe’er  
Has danced the sword-dance of Cinesias.

 

HER.  And next the breath of flutes will float around you,  
And glorious sunshine, such as ours, you’ll see,  
And myrtle groves, and happy bands who clap  
Their hands in triumph, men and women too.

 

DIO.  And who are they?  HER. The happy mystic bands,

 

XAN.  And I’m the donkey in the mystery show.  
But I’ll not stand it, not one instant longer.

 

HER.  Who’ll tell you everything you want to know.  
You’ll find them dwelling close beside the road  
You are going to travel, just at Pluto’s gate.  
And fare thee well, my brother.  DIO. And to you  
Good cheer. \(*To Xan.*\) Now, sirrah, pick you up the traps.

 

XAN.  Before I’ve put them down?  DIO. And quickly too.

 

XAN.  No, prithee, no; but hire a body, one  
They’re carrying out, on purpose for the trip.

 

DIO.  If I can’t find one?  XAN. Then I’ll take them.  DIO. Good.  
And see\! they are carrying out a body now.  
Hallo\! you there, you deadman, are you willing  
To carry down our little traps to Hades?

 

CORPSE. What are they?  DIO. These.  CORP. Two drachmas for the job?

 

DIO.  Nay, that’s too much.  CORP. Out of the pathway, you\!

 

DIO.  Beshrew thee, stop: maybe we’ll strike a bargain.

 

CORP.  Pay me two drachmas, or it’s no use talking.

 

DIO.  One and a half.  CORP. I’d liefer live again\!

 

XAN.  How absolute the knave is\! He be hanged\!  
I’ll go myself.  DIO. You’re the right sort, my man.  
Now to the ferry.  CHARON. Yoh, up\! lay her to.

 

XAN.  Whatever’s that?  DIO. Why, that’s the lake, by Zeus,  
Whereof he spake, and yon’s the ferry-boat.

 

XAN.  Poseidon, yes, and that old fellow’s Charon.

 

DIO.  Charon\! O welcome, Charon\! welcome, Charon\!

 

CHAR.  Who’s for the Rest from every pain and ill?  
Who’s for the Lethe’s plain? the Donkey-shearings?  
Who’s for Cerberia? Taenarum? or the Ravens?

 

DIO.  I.  CHAR. Hurry in.  DIO. But where are you going really?  
In truth to the Ravens?  CHAR. Aye, for your behoof.  
Step in.  DIO. \(*To Xan.*\) Now, lad.  CHAR. A slave? I take no slave,  
Unless he has fought for his bodyrights at sea.

 

XAN.  I couldn’t go. I’d got the eye-disease.

 

CHAR.  Then fetch a circuit round about the lake.

 

XAN.  Where must I wait?  CHAR. Beside the Withering stone,  
Hard by the Rest.  DIO. You understand?  XAN. Too well.  
O, what ill omen crossed me as I started\!

 

CHAR.  \(*To Dio.*\) Sit to the oar. \(*Calling.*\) Who else for the boat? Be quick.  
\(*To Dio.*\) Hi\! What are you doing?  DIO. What am I doing? Sitting  
On to the oar. You told me to, yourself.

 

CHAR.  Now sit you there, you little Potgut.  DIO. So?

 

CHAR.  Now stretch your arms full length before you.  DIO. So?

 

CHAR.  Come, don’t keep fooling; plant your feet, and now  
Pull with a will.  DIO. Why, how am *I* to pull?  
I’m not an oarsman, seaman, Salaminian.  
I can’t\!  CHAR. You can. Just dip your oar in once,  
You’ll hear the loveliest timing songs.  DIO. What from?

 

CHAR.  Frog-swans, most wonderful.  DIO. Then give the word.

 

CHAR.  Heave ahoy\! heave ahoy\!

 

FROGS.  Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax\!  
Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax\!  
We children of the fountain and the lake,  
Let us wake  
Our full choir-shout, as the flutes are ringing out,  
Our symphony of clear-voiced song.  
The song we used to love, in the Marshland up above,  
In praise of Dionysus to produce,  
Of Nysaean Dionysus, son of Zeus,  
When the revel-tipsy throng, all crapulous and gay,  
To our precinct reeled along on the holy  
Pitcher day.  
Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.

 

DIO.  O, dear\! O, dear\! now I declare  
I’ve got a bump upon my rump.  
FR.  Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.

 

DIO.  But you, perchance, don’t care.  
FR.  Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.

 

DIO.  Hang you, and your ko-axing too\!  
There’s nothing but ko-ax with you.  
FR.  That is right, Mr. Busybody, right\!  
For the Muses of the lyre love us well;  
And hornfoot Pan who plays on the pipe his jocund lays;  
And Apollo, Harper bright, in our Chorus takes delight;  
For the strong reed’s sake which I grow within my lake  
To be girdled in his lyre’s deep shell.  
Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.

 

DIO.  My hands are blistered very sore;  
My stern below is sweltering so,  
‘Twill soon, I know, upturn and roar  
Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.  
O tuneful race, O, pray give o’er,  
O, sing no more.  FR. Ah, no\! ah, no\!  
Loud and louder our chant must flow.  
Sing if ever ye sang of yore,  
When in sunny and glorious days  
Through the rushes and marsh-flags springing  
On we swept, in the joy of singing  
Myriad-diving roundelays.  
Or when fleeing the storm, we went  
Down to the depths, and our choral song  
Wildly raised to a loud and long  
Bubble-bursting accompaniment.  
FR.  and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.

 

DIO.  This timing song I take from you.  
FR.  That’s a dreadful thing to do.

 

DIO.  Much more dreadful, if I row  
Till I burst myself, I trow.  
FR.  and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.

 

DIO.  Go, hang yourselves; for what care I?  
FR.  All the same we’ll shout and cry,  
Stretching all our throats with song,  
Shouting, crying, all day long,  
FR.  and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.

 

DIO.  In this you’ll never, never win.  
FR.  This you shall not beat us in.

 

DIO.  No, nor ye prevail o’er me.  
Never\! never\! I’ll my song  
Shout, if need be, all day long,  
Until I’ve learned to master your ko-ax.  
Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.  
I thought I’d put a stop to your ko-ax.

 

CHAR.  Stop\! Easy\! Take the oar and push her to.  
Now pay your fare and go.  DIO. Here ’tis: two obols.  
Xanthias\! where’s Xanthias? Is it Xanthias there?

 

XAN.  Hoi, hoi\!  DIO. Come hither.  XAN. Glad to meet you, master.

 

DIO.  What have you there?  XAN. Nothing but filth and darkness.

 

DIO.  But tell me, did you see the parricides  
And perjured folk he mentioned?  XAN. Didn’t you?

 

DIO.  Poseidon, yes. Why, look\! \(*Pointing to the audience.*\) I see them now.  
What’s the next step?  XAN. We’d best be moving on.  
This is the spot where Heracles declared  
Those savage monsters dwell.  DIO. O, hang the fellow\!  
That’s all his bluff: he thought to scare me off,  
The jealous dog, knowing my plucky ways.  
There’s no such swaggerer lives as Heracles.  
Why, I’d like nothing better than to achieve  
Some bold adventure, worthy of our trip.

 

XAN.  I know you would. Hallo\! I hear a noise.

 

DIO.  Where? what?  XAN. Behind us, there.  DIO. Get you behind.

 

XAN.  No, it’s in front.  DIO. Get you in front directly.

 

XAN.  And now I see the most ferocious monster.

 

DIO.  O, what’s it like?  XAN. Like everything by turns.  
Now it’s a bull: now it’s a mule: and now  
The loveliest girl.  DIO. O, where? I’ll go and meet her.

 

XAN.  It’s ceased to be a girl: it’s a dog now.

 

DIO.  It is Empusa\!  XAN. Well, its face is all  
Ablaze with fire.  DIO. Has it a copper leg?

 

XAN.  A copper leg? yes, one; and one of cow dung.

 

DIO.  O, whither shall I flee?  XAN. O, whither I?

 

DIO.  My priest, protect me, and we’ll sup together.

 

XAN.  King Heracles, we’re done for.  DIO. O, forbear,  
Good fellow, call me anything but that.

 

XAN.  Well, then, Dionysus.  DIO. O, that’s worse again.

 

XAN.  \(*To the Spectre.*\) Aye, go thy way. O master, here, come here.

 

DIO.  O, what’s up now?  XAN. Take courage; all’s serene.  
And, like Hegelochus, we now may say,  
“Out of the storm there comes a new fine wether.”  
Empusa’s gone.  DIO. Swear it.  XAN. By Zeus she is.

 

DIO.  Swear it again.  XAN. By Zeus.  DIO. Again.  XAN. By Zeus.  
O, dear, O, dear, how pale I grew to see her,  
But *he* from fright has yellowed me all over.

 

DIO.  Ah me, whence fall these evils on my head?  
Who is the god to blame for my destruction?  
Air, Zeus’ chamber, or the Foot of Time?  
\(*A flute is played behind the scenes.*\)

 

DIO.  Hist\!  XAN. What’s the matter?  DIO. Didn’t you hear it?

 

XAN.  What?

 

DIO.  The breath of flutes.  XAN. Aye, and a whiff of torches  
Breathed o’er me too; a very mystic whiff.

 

DIO.  Then crouch we down, and mark what’s going on.

 

CHORUS.  \(*In the distance.*\)  O Iacchus\!

 

O Iacchus\! O Iacchus\!

 

XAN.  O have it, master: ’tis those blessed Mystics,  
Of whom he told us, sporting hereabouts.  
They sing the Iacchus which Diagoras made.

 

DIO.  I think so too: we had better both keep quiet  
And so find out exactly what it is.  
\(*The calling forth of Iacchus.*\)

 

CHOR.  O Iacchus\! power excelling, here in stately temples dwelling,

 

O Iacchus\! O Iacchus\!  
Come to tread this verdant level,  
Come to dance in mystic revel,  
Come whilst round thy forehead hurtles  
Many a wreath of fruitful myrtles,  
Come with wild and saucy paces  
Mingling in our joyous dance,  
Pure and holy, which embraces all the charms of all the Graces,  
When the mystic choirs advance.

 

XAN.  Holy and sacred queen, Demeter’s daughter,  
O, what a jolly whiff of pork breathed o’er me\!

 

DIO.  Hist\! and perchance you’ll get some tripe yourself.  
\(*The welcome to Iacchus.*\)

 

CHOR.  Come, arise, from sleep awaking, come the fiery torches shaking,

 

O Iacchus\! O Iacchus\!  
Morning Star that shinest nightly.  
Lo, the mead is blazing brightly,  
Age forgets its years and sadness,  
Agèd knees curvet for gladness,  
Lift thy flashing torches o’er us,  
Marshal all thy blameless train,  
Lead, O, lead the way before us; lead the lovely youthful Chorus  
To the marshy flowery plain.  
\(*The warning-off of the profane.*\)  
All evil thoughts and profane be still: far hence, far hence from our choirs depart,  
Who knows not well what the Mystics tell, or is not holy and pure of heart;  
Who ne’er has the noble revelry learned, or danced the dance of the Muses high;  
Or shared in the Bacchic rites which old bull-eating Cratinus’ word supply;  
Who vulgar coarse buffoonery loves, though all untimely the jests they make;  
Or lives not easy and kind with all, or kindling faction forbears to slake,  
But fans the fire, from a base desire some pitiful gain for himself to reap;  
Or takes, in office, his gifts and bribes, while the city is tossed on the stormy deep;  
Who fort or fleet to the foe betrays; or, a vile Thorycion, ships away  
Forbidden stores from Aegina’s shores, to Epidaurus across the Bay  
Transmitting oar-pads and sails and tar, that curst collector of five per cents;  
The knave who tries to procure supplies for the use of the enemy’s armaments;  
The Cyclian singer who dares befoul the Lady Hecate’s wayside shrine;  
The public speaker who once lampooned in our Bacchic feasts would, with heart malign,  
Keep nibbling away the Comedians’ pay; — to these I utter my warning cry,  
I charge them once, I charge them twice, I charge them thrice, that they draw not nigh  
To the sacred dance of the mystic choir. But YE, my comrades, awake the song,  
The night-long revels of joy and mirth which ever of right to our feast belong.  
\(*The start of the procession.*\)  
Advance, true hearts, advance\!  
On to the gladsome bowers,  
On to the sward, with flowers  
Embosomed bright\!  
March on with jest, and jeer, and dance,  
Full well ye’ve supped to-night.  
\(*The processional hymn to Persephone.*\)  
              March, chanting loud your lays,  
 Your hearts and voices raising,  
 The Saviour goddess praising  
     Who vows she’ll still  
 Our city save to endless days,  
 Whate’er Thorycion’s will.  
Break off the measure, and change the time; and now with chanting and hymns adorn  
Demeter, goddess mighty and high, the harvest-queen, the giver of corn.  
\(*The processional hymn to Demeter.*\)  
        O Lady, over our rites presiding,  
Preserve and succour thy choral throng,  
And grant us all, in thy help confiding,  
To dance and revel the whole day long;

 

AND MUCH in earnest, and much in jest,  
Worthy thy feast, may we speak therein.  
And when we have bantered and laughed our best,  
The victor’s wreath be it ours to win.  
Call we now the youthful god, call him hither without delay,  
Him who travels amongst his chorus, dancing along on the Sacred Way.  
\(*The processional hymn to Iacchus.*\)  
      O, come with the joy of thy festival song,  
O, come to the goddess, O, mix with our throng  
Untired, though the journey be never so long.

 

O Lord of the frolic and dance,  
Iacchus, beside me advance\!  
For fun, and for cheapness, our dress thou hast rent,  
Through thee we may dance to the top of our bent,  
Reviling, and jeering, and none will resent.

 

O Lord of the frolic and dance,  
Iacchus, beside me advance\!  
A sweet pretty girl I observed in the show,  
Her robe had been torn in the scuffle, and lo,  
There peeped through the tatters a bosom of snow.

 

O Lord of the frolic and dance,  
Iacchus, beside me advance\!

 

DIO.  Wouldn’t I like to follow on, and try  
A little sport and dancing?  XAN. Wouldn’t I?  
\(*The banter at the bridge of Cephisus.*\)

 

*CHOR.*      Shall we all a merry joke  
 At Archedemus poke,  
Who has not cut his guildsmen yet, though seven years old;  
 Yet up among the dead  
 He is demagogue and head,  
And contrives the topmost place of the rascaldom to hold?  
 And Cleisthenes, they say,  
 Is among the tombs all day,  
Bewailing for his lover with a lamentable whine.  
 And Callias, I’m told,  
 Has become a sailor bold,  
And casts a lion’s hide o’er his members feminine.

 

DIO.        Can any of you tell  
 Where Pluto here may dwell?  
For we, sirs, are two strangers who were never here before.

 

*CHOR.*      O, then no further stray,  
 Nor again inquire the way,  
For know that ye have journeyed to his very entrance-door.

 

DIO.        Take up the wraps, my lad.

 

XAN.        Now is not this too bad?  
Like “Zeus’ Corinth,” he “the wraps” keeps saying o’er and o’er.

 

CHOR.  Now wheel your sacred dances through the glade with flowers bedight,  
All ye who are partakers of the holy festal rite;  
And I will with the women and the holy maidens go  
Where they keep the nightly vigil, an auspicious light to show.  
\(*The departure for the Thriasian Plain*\)  
                Now haste we to the roses,  
   And the meadows full of posies,  
   Now haste we to the meadows  
       In our own old way,  
   In choral dances blending,  
   In dances never ending,  
   Which only for the holy  
       The Destinies array.  
   O happy mystic chorus,  
   The blessed sunshine o’er us  
   On us alone is smiling,  
       In its soft sweet light:  
   On us who strove for ever  
   With holy, pure endeavour,  
   Alike by friend and stranger  
       To guide our steps aright.

 

DIO.  What’s the right way to knock? I wonder how  
The natives here are wont to knock at doors.

 

XAN.  No dawdling: taste the door. You’ve got, remember,  
The lion-hide and pride of Heracles.

 

DIO.  Boy\! Boy\!  AEACUS. Who’s there?  DIO. I, Heracles the strong\!

 

AEAC.  O you most shameless desperate ruffian, you\!  
O villain, villain, arrant vilest villain\!  
Who seized our Cerberus by the throat, and fled,  
And ran, and rushed, and bolted, haling off  
The dog, my charge\! But now I’ve got thee fast.  
So close the Styx’s inky-hearted rock,  
The blood-bedabbled peak of Acheron  
Shall hem thee in: the hell-hounds of Cocytus  
Prowl round thee; whilst the hundred-headed Asp  
Shall rive thy heart-strings: the Tartesian Lamprey  
Prey on thy lungs: and those Tithrasian Gorgons  
Mangle and tear thy kidneys, mauling them,  
Entrails and all, into one bloody mash.  
I’ll speed a running foot to fetch them hither.

 

XAN.  Hallo\! what now?  DIO. I’ve done it: call the god.

 

XAN.  Get up, you laughing-stock; get up directly,  
Before you’re seen.  DIO. What, *I* get up? I’m fainting.  
Please dab a sponge of water on my heart.

 

XAN.  Here\!  DIO. Dab it, you.  XAN. Where? O ye golden gods,  
Lies your heart there?  DIO. It got so terrified  
It fluttered down into my stomach’s pit.

 

XAN.  Cowardliest of gods and men\!  DIO. The cowardliest? I?  
What, I, who asked you for a sponge, a thing  
A coward never would have done\!  XAN. What then?

 

DIO.  A coward would have lain there wallowing;  
But I stood up, and wiped myself withal.

 

XAN.  Poseidon\! quite heroic.  DIO. ‘Deed I think so.  
But weren’t *you* frightened at those dreadful threats  
And shoutings?  XAN. Frightened? Not a bit. I cared not.

 

DIO.  Come then, if you’re so *very* brave a man,  
Will you be I, and take the hero’s club  
And lion’s skin, since you’re so monstrous plucky?  
And I’ll be now the slave, and bear the luggage.

 

XAN.  Hand them across. I cannot choose but take them.  
And now observe the Xanthio-heracles  
If I’m a coward and a sneak like you.

 

DIO.  Nay, you’re the rogue from Melite’s own self.  
And I’ll pick up and carry on the traps.

 

MAID.  O, welcome, Heracles\! come in, sweetheart.  
My Lady, when they told her, set to work,  
Baked mighty loaves, boiled two or three tureens  
Of lentil soup, roasted a prime ox whole,  
Made rolls and honey-cakes. So come along.

 

XAN.  \(*Declining.*\) You are too kind.  MAID. I will not let you go.  
I will not LET you\! Why, she’s stewing slices  
Of juicy bird’s-flesh, and she’s making comfits,  
And tempering down her richest wine. Come, dear,  
Come along in.  XAN. \(*Still declining.*\) Pray thank her.  MAID. O, you’re jesting  
I shall not let you off: there’s such a lovely  
Flute-girl all ready, and we’ve two or three  
Dancing-girls also.  XAN. Eh\! what\! Dancing-girls?

 

MAID.  Young budding virgins, freshly tired and trimmed.  
Come, dear, come in. The cook was dishing up  
The cutlets, and they are bringing in the tables.

 

XAN.  Then go you in, and tell those dancing-girls  
Of whom you spake, I’m coming in Myself.  
Pick up the traps, my lad, and follow me.

 

DIO.  Hi\! stop\! you’re not in earnest, just because  
I dressed you up, in fun, as Heracles?  
Come, don’t keep fooling, Xanthias, but lift  
And carry in the traps yourself.  XAN. Why\! what\!  
You are never going to strip me of these togs  
You gave me\!  DIO. Going to? No, I’m doing it now.  
Off with that lion-skin.  XAN. Bear witness all,  
The Gods shall judge between us.  DIO. Gods, indeed\!  
Why, how could *you* \(the vain and foolish thought\!\)  
A slave, a mortal, act Alcmena’s son?

 

XAN.  All right, then, take them; maybe, if God will,  
You’ll soon require my services again.

 

CHOR.  This is the part of a dexterous clever  
Man with his wits about him ever,  
One who has travelled the world to see;  
Always to shift, and to keep through all  
Close to the sunny side of the wall;  
Not like a pictured block to be,  
Standing always in one position;  
Nay, but to veer, with expedition,  
And ever to catch the favouring breeze,  
This is the part of a shrewd tactician,  
This is to be a — THERAMENES\!

 

DIO.  Truly an exquisite joke ’twould be,  
Him with a dancing-girl to see,  
Lolling at ease on Milesian rugs;  
Me, like a slave, beside him standing,  
Aught that he wants to his lordship handing;  
Then as the damsel fair he hugs,  
Seeing me all on fire to embrace her,  
He would perchance \(for there’s no man baser\),  
Turning him round like a lazy lout,  
Straight on my mouth deliver a facer,  
Knocking my ivory choirmen out.

 

HOSTESS.  O Plathane\! Plathane\! Here’s that naughty man,  
That’s he who got into our tavern once,  
And ate up sixteen loaves.  PLATHANE. O, so he is\!  
The very man.  XAN. Bad luck for somebody\!

 

HOS.  O, and, besides, those twenty bits of stew,  
Half-obol pieces.  XAN. Somebody’s going to catch it\!

 

HOS.  That garlic too.  DIO. Woman, you’re talking nonsense.  
You don’t know what you’re saying.  HOS. O, you thought  
I shouldn’t know you with your buskins on\!  
Ah, and I’ve not yet mentioned all that fish,  
No, nor the new-made cheese: he gulped it down,  
Baskets and all, unlucky that we were.  
And when I just alluded to the price,  
He looked so fierce, and bellowed like a bull.

 

XAN.  Yes, that’s his way; that’s what he always does.

 

HOS.  O, and he drew his sword, and seemed quite mad.

 

PLA.  O, that he did.  HOS. And terrified us so  
We sprang up to the cockloft, she and I.  
Then out he hurled, decamping with the rugs.

 

XAN.  That’s his way too; but something must be done.

 

HOS.  Quick, run and call my patron Cleon here\!

 

PLA.  O, if you meet him, call Hyperbolus\!  
We’ll pay you out to-day.  HOS. O filthy throat,  
O, how I’d like to take a stone, and hack  
Those grinders out with which you chawed my wares.

 

PLA.  I’d like to pitch you in the deadman’s pit.

 

HOS.  I’d like to get a reaping-hook and scoop  
That gullet out with which you gorged my tripe.  
But I’ll to Cleon: he’ll soon serve his writs;  
He’ll twist it out of you to-day, he will.

 

DIO.  Perdition seize me, if I don’t love Xanthias.

 

XAN.  Aye, aye, I know your drift: stop, stop that talking.  
I won’t be Heracles.  DIO. O, don’t say so,  
Dear, darling Xanthias.  XAN. Why, how can I,  
A slave, a mortal, act Alcmena’s son\!

 

DIO.  Aye, aye, I know you are vexed, and I deserve it,  
And if you pummel me, I won’t complain.  
But if I strip you of these togs again,  
Perdition seize myself, my wife, my children,  
And, most of all, that blear-eyed Archedemus.

 

XAN.  That oath contents me: on those terms I take them.

 

CHOR.  Now that at last you appear once more,  
Wearing the garb that at first you wore,  
Wielding the club and the tawny skin,  
Now it is yours to be up and doing,  
Glaring like mad, and your youth renewing,  
Mindful of him whose guise you are in.  
If, when caught in a bit of a scrape, you  
Suffer a word of alarm to escape you,  
Showing yourself but a feckless knave,  
Then will your master at once undrape you,  
Then you’ll again be the toiling slave.

 

XAN.  There, I admit, you have given to me a  
Capital hint, and the like idea,  
Friends, had occurred to myself before.  
Truly if anything good befell  
He would be wanting, I know full well,  
Wanting to take to the togs once more.  
Nevertheless, while in these I’m vested,  
Ne’er shall you find me craven-crested,  
No, for a dittany look I’ll wear,  
Aye, and methinks it will soon be tested:  
Hark\! how the portals are rustling there.

 

AEAC.  Seize the dog-stealer, bind him, pinion him,  
Drag him to justice\!  DIO. Somebody’s going to catch it.

 

XAN.  \(*Striking out.*\) Hands off\! get away\! stand back\!  AEAC. Eh? You’re for fighting?  
Ho\! Ditylas, Sceblyas, and Pardocas,  
Come hither, quick; fight me this sturdy knave.

 

DIO.  Now isn’t it a shame the man should strike,  
And he a thief besides?  AEAC. A monstrous shame\!

 

DIO.  A regular burning shame\!  XAN. By the Lord Zeus,  
If ever I was here before, if ever  
I stole one hair’s-worth from you, let me die\!  
And now I’ll make you a right noble offer:  
Arrest my lad: torture him as you will,  
And if you find I’m guilty, take and kill me.

 

AEAC.  Torture him, how?  XAN. In any mode you please.  
Pile bricks upon him: stuff his nose with acid:  
Flay, rack him, hoist him; flog him with a scourge  
Of prickly bristles: only not with this,  
A soft-leaved onion, or a tender leek.

 

AEAC.  A fair proposal. If I strike too hard  
And maim the boy, I’ll make you compensation.

 

XAN.  I shan’t require it. Take him out and flog him.

 

AEAC.  Nay, but I’ll do it here before your eyes.  
Now then, put down the traps, and mind you speak  
The truth, you fellow.  DIO. \(*In agony.*\) Man\! don’t torture ME\!  
I am a god. You’ll blame yourself hereafter  
If you touch ME.  AEAC. Hillo\! What’s that you are saying?

 

DIO.  I say I’m Bacchus, son of Zeus, a god,  
And *he’s* the slave.  AEAC. You hear him?  XAN. Hear him? Yes.  
All the more reason you should flog him well.  
For if he is a god, he won’t perceive it.

 

DIO.  Well, but you say that you’re a god yourself.  
So why not *you* be flogged as well as I?

 

XAN.  A fair proposal. And be this the test:  
Whichever of us two you first behold  
Flinching or crying out — he’s not the god.

 

AEAC.  Upon my word you’re quite the gentleman,  
You’re all for right and justice. Strip then, both.

 

XAN.  How can you test us fairly?  AEAC. Easily,  
I’ll give you blow for blow.  XAN. A good idea.  
We’re ready\! Now\! \(*Aeacus strikes him*\) see if you catch me flinching.

 

AEAC.  I struck you.  XAN. \(*Incredulously.*\) No\!  AEAC. Well, it seems “no,” indeed.  
Now then I’ll strike the other \(*Strikes Dio.*\).  DIO. Tell me when.

 

AEAC.  I struck you.  DIO. Struck me? Then why didn’t I sneeze?

 

AEAC.  Don’t know, I’m sure. I’ll try the other again.

 

XAN.  And quickly too. Good gracious\!  AEAC. Why “good gracious”?  
Not hurt you, did I?  XAN. No, I merely thought of  
The Diomeian feast of Heracles.

 

AEAC.  A holy man\! ’Tis now the other’s turn.

 

DIO.  Hi\! Hi\!  AEAC. Hallo\!  DIO. Look at those horsemen, look\!

 

AEAC.  But why these tears?  DIO. There’s such a smell of onions.

 

AEAC.  Then you don’t mind it?  DIO. \(*Cheerfully.*\) Mind it? Not a bit.

 

AEAC.  Well, I must go to the other one again.

 

XAN.  O\! O\!  AEAC. Hallo\!  XAN. Do, pray, pull out this thorn.

 

AEAC.  What does it mean? ’Tis this one’s turn again.

 

DIO.  \(*Shrieking.*\) Apollo\! Lord\! \(*Calmly*\) of Delos and of Pytho.

 

XAN.  He flinched\! You heard him?  DIO. Not at all; a jolly  
Verse of Hipponax flashed across my mind.

 

XAN.  You don’t half do it: cut his flanks to pieces.

 

AEAC.  By Zeus, well thought on. Turn your belly here.

 

DIO.  \(*Screaming.*\) Poseidon\!  XAN. There\! he’s flinching.  DIO. \(*Singing*\) who dost reign  
Amongst the Aegean peaks and creeks  
And o’er the deep blue main.

 

AEAC.  No, by Demeter, still I can’t find out  
Which is the god, but come ye both indoors;  
My lord himself and Persephassa there,  
Being gods themselves, will soon find out the truth.

 

DIO.  Right\! right\! I only wish you had thought of that  
Before you gave me those tremendous whacks.

 

CHOR.  Come, Muse, to our mystical Chorus, O, come to the joy of my song,  
O, see on the benches before us that countless and wonderful throng,  
Where wits by the thousand abide, with more than a Cleophons’ pride —   
On the lips of that foreigner base, of Athens the bane and disgrace,  
There is shrieking, his kinsman by race,  
The garrulous swallow of Thrace;  
From the perch of exotic descent,  
Rejoicing her sorrow to vent,  
She pours, to her spirit’s content, a nightingale’s woful lament  
That e’en though the voting be equal, his ruin will soon be the sequel.  
Well it suits the holy Chorus evermore with counsel wise  
To exhort and teach the city; this we therefore now advise —   
End the townsmen’s apprehensions; equalize the rights of all;  
If by Phrynichus’ wrestlings some perchance sustained a fall,  
Yet to these ’tis surely open, having put away their sin,  
For their slips and vacillations pardon at your hands to win.  
Give your brethren back their franchise. Sin and shame it were that slaves,  
Who have once with stern devotion fought your battle on the waves,  
Should be straightway lords and masters, yea, Plataeans fully blown —   
Not that this deserves our censure; there I praise you; there alone  
Has the city, in her anguish, policy and wisdom shown —   
Nay, but these, of old accustomed on our ships to fight and win  
\(They, their fathers too before them\), these, our very kith and kin,  
You should likewise, when they ask you, pardon for their single sin.  
O, by nature best and wisest, O, relax your jealous ire,  
Let us all the world as kinsfolk and as citizens acquire,  
All who on our ships will battle well and bravely by our side.  
If we cocker up our city, narrowing her with senseless pride,  
Now when she is rocked and reeling in the cradles of the sea,  
Here again will after ages deem we acted brainlessly.  
And O, if I’m able to scan the habits and life of a man  
Who shall rue his iniquities soon\! not long shall that little baboon,  
That Cleigenes shifty and small, the wickedest bath-man of all  
Who are lords of the earth — which is brought from the isle of Cimolus, and wrought  
 With nitre and lye into soap —   
 Not long shall he vex us, I hope.  
 And this the unlucky one knows,  
 Yet ventures a peace to oppose,  
And being addicted to blows, he carries a stick as he goes,  
Lest while he is tipsy and reeling, some robber his cloak should be stealing.  
Often has it crossed my fancy, that the city loves to deal  
With the very best and noblest members of her commonwealth,  
Just as with our ancient coinage, and the newly-minted gold.  
Yea, for these, our sterling pieces, all of pure Athenian mould,  
All of perfect die and metal, all the fairest of the fair,  
All of workmanship unequalled, proved and valued everywhere  
Both amongst our own Hellenes and Barbarians far away,  
These we use not: but the worthless pinchbeck coins of yesterday,  
Vilest die and basest metal, now we always use instead.  
Even so, our sterling townsmen, nobly born and nobly bred,  
Men of worth and rank and mettle, men of honourable fame,  
Trained in every liberal science, choral dance, and manly game,  
These we treat with scorn and insult, but the strangers newliest come,  
Worthless sons of worthless fathers, pinchbeck townsmen, yellowy scum,  
Whom in earlier days the city hardly would have stooped to use  
Even for her scapegoat victims, these for every task we choose.  
O unwise and foolish people, yet to mend your ways begin;  
Use again the good and useful: so hereafter, if ye win  
‘Twill be due to this your wisdom: if ye fall, at least ‘twill be  
Not a fall that brings dishonour, falling from a worthy tree.

 

AEAC.  By Zeus the Saviour, quite the gentleman  
Your master is.  XAN. Gentleman? I believe you.  
He’s all for wine and women, is my master.

 

AEAC.  But not to have flogged you, when the truth came out  
That you, the slave, were passing off as master\!

 

XAN.  He’d get the worst of that.  AEAC. Bravo\! that’s spoken  
Like a true slave: that’s what I love myself.

 

XAN.  You love it, do you?  AEAC. Love it? I’m entranced  
When I can curse my lord behind his back.

 

XAN.  How about grumbling, when you have felt the stick,  
And scurry out of doors?  AEAC. That’s jolly too.

 

XAN.  How about prying?  AEAC. That beats everything\!

 

XAN.  Great Kin-god Zeus\! And what of overhearing  
Your master’s secrets?  AEAC. What? I’m mad with joy.

 

XAN.  And blabbing them abroad?  AEAC. O, heaven and earth\!  
When I do that, I can’t contain myself.

 

XAN.  Phoebus Apollo\! clap your hand in mine,  
Kiss and be kissed: and prithee tell me this,  
Tell me by Zeus, our rascaldom’s own god,  
What’s all that noise within? What means this hubbub  
And row?  AEAC. That’s Æschylus and Euripides.

 

XAN.  Eh?  AEAC. Wonderful, wonderful things are going on.  
The dead are rioting, taking different sides.

 

XAN.  Why, what’s the matter?  AEAC. There’s a custom here  
With all the crafts, the good and noble crafts,  
That the chief master of his art in each  
Shall have his dinner in the assembly hall,  
And sit by Pluto’s side.  XAN. I understand.

 

AEAC.  Until another comes, more wise than he  
In the same art: then must the first give way.

 

XAN.  And how has this disturbed our Æschylus?

 

AEAC.  ’Twas he that occupied the tragic chair,  
As, in his craft, the noblest.  XAN. Who does now?

 

AEAC.  But when Euripides came down, he kept  
Flourishing off before the highwaymen,  
Thieves, burglars, parricides — these form our mob  
In Hades — till with listening to his twists  
And turns, and pleas and counterpleas, they went  
Mad on the man, and hailed him first and wisest:  
Elate with this, he claimed the tragic chair  
Where Æschylus was seated.  XAN. Wasn’t he pelted?

 

AEAC.  Not he: the populace clamoured out to try  
Which of the twain was wiser in his art.

 

XAN.  You mean the rascals?  AEAC. Aye, as high as heaven\!

 

XAN.  But were there none to side with Æschylus?

 

AEAC.  Scanty and sparse the good, \(*Regards the audience*\) the same as here.

 

XAN.  And what does Pluto now propose to do?

 

AEAC.  He means to hold a tournament, and bring  
Their tragedies to the proof.  XAN. But Sophocles,  
How came not he to claim the tragic chair?

 

AEAC.  Claim it? Not he\! When *he* came down, he kissed  
With reverence Æschylus, and clasped his hand,  
And yielded willingly the chair to him.  
But now he’s going, says Cleidemides,  
To sit third-man: and then if Æschylus win,  
He’ll stay content: if not, for his art’s sake,  
He’ll fight to the death against Euripides.

 

XAN.  Will it come off?  AEAC. O, yes, by Zeus, directly.  
And then, I hear, will wonderful things be done,  
The art poetic will be weighed in scales.

 

XAN.  What\! weigh out tragedy, like butcher’s meat?

 

AEAC.  Levels they’ll bring, and measuring-tapes for words,  
And moulded oblongs.  XAN. Is it bricks they are making?

 

AEAC.  Wedges and compasses: for Euripides  
Vows that he’ll test the dramas, word by word.

 

XAN.  Æschylus chafes at this, I fancy.  AEAC. Well,  
He lowered his brows, upglaring like a bull.

 

XAN.  And who’s to be the judge?  AEAC. There came the rub.  
Skilled men were hard to find: for with the Athenians  
Æschylus, somehow, did not hit it off.

 

XAN.  Too many burglars, I expect he thought.

 

AEAC.  And all the rest, he said, were trash and nonsense  
To judge poetic wits. So then at last  
They chose your lord, an expert in the art.  
But go we in: for when our lords are bent  
On urgent business, that means blows for us.

 

CHOR.  O, surely with terrible wrath will the thunder-voiced monarch be filled,  
When he sees his opponent beside him, the tonguester, the artifice-skilled,  
Stand, whetting his tusks for the fight\! O, surely, his eyes, rolling fell,  
 Will with terrible madness be fraught\!  
O, then will be charging of plume-waving words with their wild-floating mane,  
And then will be whirling of splinters, and phrases smoothed down with the plane,  
When the man would the grand-stepping maxims, the language gigantic, repel  
 Of the hero-creator of thought.  
There will his shaggy-born crest upbristle for anger and woe,  
Horribly frowning and growling, his fury will launch at the foe  
Huge-clamped masses of words, with exertion Titanic uptearing  
 Great ship-timber planks for the fray.  
But here will the tongue be at work, uncoiling, word-testing, refining,  
Sophist-creator of phrases, dissecting, detracting, maligning,  
Shaking the envious bits, and with subtle analysis paring  
 The lung’s large labour away.

 

EURIPIDES.  Don’t talk to me; I won’t give up the chair,  
I say I am better in the art than he.

 

DIO.  You hear him, Æschylus: why don’t you speak?

 

EUR.  He’ll do the grand at first, the juggling trick  
He used to play in all his tragedies.

 

DIO.  Come, my fine fellow; pray, don’t talk too big.

 

EUR.  I know the man, I’ve scanned him through and through,  
A savage-creating stubborn-pulling fellow,  
Uncurbed, unfettered, uncontrolled of speech,  
Unperiphrastic, bombastiloquent.

 

ÆSCHYLUS.  Hah\! sayest thou so, child of the garden quean\!  
And this to ME, thou chattery-babble-collector,  
Thou pauper-creating rags-and-patches-stitcher?  
Thou shalt abye it dearly\!  DIO. Pray, be still;  
Nor heat thy soul to fury, Æschylus.

 

ÆSCH. Not till I’ve made you see the sort of man  
This cripple-maker is who crows so loudly.

 

DIO.  Bring out a ewe, a black-fleeced ewe, my boys:  
Here’s a typhoon about to burst upon us.

 

ÆSCH.  Thou picker-up of Cretan monodies,  
Foisting thy tales of incest on the stage — 

 

DIO.  Forbear, forbear, most honoured Æschylus;  
And you, poor Euripides, begone,  
If you are wise, out of this pitiless hail,  
Lest with some heady word he crack your skull  
And batter out your brain — less Telephus.  
And not with passion, Æschylus, but calmly  
Test and be tested. ’Tis not meet for poets  
To scold each other, like two baking-girls.  
But you go roaring like an oak on fire.

 

EUR.  I’m ready, I\! I don’t draw back one bit.  
I’ll lash or, if he will, let him lash first  
The talk, the lays, the sinews of a play:  
Aye, and my Peleus, aye, and Aeolus,  
And Meleager, aye, and Telephus.

 

DIO.  And what do *you* propose? Speak, Æschylus.

 

ÆSCH.  I could have wished to meet him otherwhere.  
We fight not here on equal terms.  DIO. Why not?

 

ÆSCH.  My poetry survived me: his died with him:  
He’s got it here, all handy to recite.  
Howbeit, if so you wish it, so we’ll have it.

 

DIO.  O, bring men fire, and bring me frankincense.  
I’ll pray, or e’er the clash of wits begin,  
To judge the strife with high poetic skill.  
Meanwhile \(*To the Chorus*\) invoke the Muses with a song.

 

CHOR.  O Muses, the daughters divine of Zeus, the immaculate Nine,  
Who gaze from your mansions serene on intellects subtle and keen,  
When down to the tournament lists, in bright-polished wit they descend,  
With wrestling and turnings and twists in the battle of words to contend,  
O, come and behold what the two antagonist poets can do,  
Whose mouths are the swiftest to teach grand language and filings of speech:  
For now of their wits is the sternest encounter commencing in earnest.

 

DIO.  Ye two, put up your prayers before ye start.

 

ÆSCH.  Demeter, mistress, nourisher of my soul,  
O, make me worthy of thy mystic rites\!

 

DIO.  \(*To Eur.*\) Now put on incense, you.  EUR. Excuse me, no;  
My vows are paid to other gods than these.

 

DIO.  What, a new coinage of your own?  EUR. Precisely.

 

DIO.  Pray then to them, those private gods of yours.

 

EUR.  Ether, my pasture, volubly-rolling tongue,  
Intelligent wit and critic nostrils keen,  
O’ well and neatly may I trounce his plays\!

 

CHOR.  We also yearning from these to be learning  
Some stately measure, some majestic grand  
Movement telling of conflicts nigh.  
Now for battle arrayed they stand,  
Tongues embittered, and anger high.  
Each has got a venturesome will,  
Each an eager and nimble mind;  
One will wield, with artistic skill,  
Clear-cut phrases, and wit refined;  
Then the other, with words defiant,  
Stern and strong, like an angry giant  
Laying on with uprooted trees,  
Soon will scatter a world of these  
Superscholastic subtleties.

 

DIO.  Now then, commence your arguments, and mind you both display  
True wit, not metaphors, nor things which any fool could say.

 

EUR.  As for myself, good people all, I’ll tell you by-and-by  
My own poetic worth and claims; but first of all I’ll try  
To show how this portentous quack beguiled the silly fools  
Whose tastes were nurtured, ere he came, in Phrynichus’ schools.  
He’d bring some single mourner on, seated and veiled, ’twould be  
Achilles, say, or Niobe — the face you could not see —   
An empty show of tragic woe, who uttered not one thing.

 

DIO.  ’Tis true.  EUR. then in the Chorus came, and rattled off a string  
Of four continuous lyric odes: the mourner never stirred.

 

DIO.  I liked it too. I sometimes think that I those mutes preferred  
To all your chatterers now-a-days.  EUR. Because, if you must know,  
You were an ass.  DIO. An ass, no doubt: what made him do it though?

 

EUR.  That was his quackery, don’t you see, to set the audience guessing  
When Niobe would speak; meanwhile, the drama was progressing.

 

DIO.  The rascal, how he took me in\! ’Twas shameful, was it not?  
\(*To Æsch.*\) What makes you stamp and fidget so?  EUR. He’s catching it so hot.  
So when he had humbugged thus awhile, and now his wretched play  
Was halfway through, a dozen words, great wild-bull words, he’d say,  
Fierce Bugaboos, with bristling crests, and shaggy eyebrows too,  
Which not a soul could understand.  ÆSCH. O, heavens\!  DIO. Be quiet, do.

 

EUR.  But not one single word was clear.  DIO. St\! don’t your teeth be  
gnashing.

 

EUR.  ’Twas all Scamanders, moated camps, and griffin-eagles flashing  
In burnished copper on the shields, chivalric-precipice — high  
Expressions, hard to comprehend.  DIO. Aye, by the Powers, and I  
Full many a sleepless night have spent in anxious thought, because  
I’d find the tawny cock-horse out, what sort of bird it was\!

 

ÆSCH.  It was a sign, you stupid dolt, engraved the ships upon.

 

DIO.  Eryxis I supposed it was, Philoxenus’ son.

 

EUR.  Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?

 

ÆSCH.  You enemy of gods and men, what was *your* practice, pray?

 

EUR.  No cock-horse in *my* plays, by Zeus, no goat-stag there you’ll  
see, Such figures as are blazoned forth in Median tapestry.  
When first I took the art from you, bloated and swoln, poor thing,  
With turgid gasconading words and heavy dieting,  
First I reduced and toned her down, and made her slim and neat  
With wordlets and with exercise and poultices of beet,  
And next a dose of chatterjuice, distilled from books, I gave her,  
And monodies she took, with sharp Cephisophon for flavour.  
I never used haphazard words, or plunged abruptly in;  
Who entered first explained at large the drama’s origin  
And source.  DIO. Its source, I really trust, was better than your own.

 

EUR.  Then from the very opening lines no idleness was shown;  
The mistress talked with all her might, the servant talked as much,  
The master talked, the maiden talked, the beldame talked.  ÆSCH. For such  
An outrage was not death your due?  EUR. No, by Apollo, no:  
That was my democratic way.  DIO. Ah, let that topic go.  
Your record is not there, my friend, particularly good.

 

EUR.  Then next I taught all these to speak.  ÆSCH. You did so, and I  
would  
That ere such mischief you had wrought, your very lungs had split.

 

EUR.  Canons of verse I introduced, and neatly chiselled wit;  
To look, to scan: to plot, to plan; to twist, to turn, to woo.  
On all to spy; in all to pry.  ÆSCH. You did: I say so too.

 

EUR.  I showed them scenes of common life, the things we know and see,  
Where any blunder would at once by all detected be.  
I never blustered on, or took their breath and wits away  
By Cycnuses or Memnons clad in terrible array,  
With bells upon their horses’ heads, the audience to dismay.  
Look at *his* pupils, look at mine: and there the contrast view.  
Uncouth Megaenetus is his, and rough Phormisius too;  
Great long-beard-lance-and-trumpet-men, flesh-tearers with the  
pine: But natty smart Theramenes, and Cleitophon are mine.

 

DIO.  Theramenes? a clever man and wonderfully sly:  
Immerse him in a flood of ills, he’ll soon be high and dry,  
“A Kian with a kappa, sir, not Chian with a chi.”

 

EUR.    I taught them all these knowing ways  
By chopping logic in my plays,  
And making all my speakers try  
To reason out the How and Why.  
So now the people trace the springs,  
The sources, and the roots of things,  
And manage all their households too  
Far better than they used to do,  
Scanning and searching *What’s amiss?*  
And, *Why was that?* And, *How is this?*

 

DIO.    Ay, truly, never now a man  
Comes home, but he begins to scan;  
And to his household loudly cries,  
*Why, where’s my pitcher? What’s the matter?*  
*’Tis dead and gone my last year’s platter.*  
*Who gnawed these olives? Bless the sprat,*  
*Who nibbled off the head of that?*  
*And where’s the garlic vanished, pray,*  
*I purchased only yesterday?*  
 — Whereas, of old, our stupid youths  
Would sit, with open mouths and eyes,  
Like any dull-brained Mammacouths.

 

*CHOR.*  “All this thou beholdest, Achilles our boldest.”  
And what wilt thou reply? Draw tight the rein  
Lest that fiery soul of thine  
Whirl thee out of the listed plain,  
Past the olives, and o’er the line.  
Dire and grievous the charge he brings.  
See thou answer him, noble heart,  
Not with passionate bickerings.  
Shape thy course with a sailor’s art,  
Reef the canvas, shorten the sails,  
Shift them edgewise to shun the gales.  
When the breezes are soft and low,  
Then, well under control, you’ll go  
Quick and quicker to strike the foe.  
O first of all the Hellenic bards high loftily-towering verse to rear,  
And tragic phrase from the dust the raise, pour forth thy fountain with right good cheer.

 

ÆSCH.  My wrath is hot at this vile mischance, and my spirit revolts at the thought that I  
Must bandy words with a fellow like *him:* but lest he should vaunt that I can’t reply —   
Come, tell me what are the points for which a noble poet our praise obtains.

 

EUR.  For his ready wit, and his counsels sage, and because the citizen folk he trains  
To be better townsmen and worthier men.  ÆSCH. If then you have done the very reverse,  
Found noble-hearted and virtuous men, and altered them, each and all, for the worse,  
Pray what is the meed you deserve to get?  DIO. Nay, ask not *him.* He deserves to die.

 

ÆSCH.  For just consider what style of men he received from me, great six-foot-high  
Heroical souls, who never would blench from a townsman’s duties in peace or war;  
Not idle loafers, or low buffoons, or rascally scamps such as now they are,  
But men who were breathing spears and helms, and the snow-white plume in its crested pride,  
The greave, and the dart, and the warrior’s heart in its seven-fold casing of tough bull-hide.

 

DIO.  He’ll stun me, I know, with his armoury-work; this business is going from bad to worse.

 

EUR.  And how did you manage to make them so grand, exalted, and brave with your wonderful verse?

 

DIO.  Come, Æschylus, answer, and don’t stand mute in your self-willed pride and arrogant spleen.

 

ÆSCH.  A drama I wrote with the War-god filled.  DIO. Its name?  ÆSCH. ’Tis the “Seven against Thebes” that I mean,  
Which whoso beheld, with eagerness swelled to rush to the battlefield there and then.

 

DIO.  O, that was a scandalous thing you did\! You have made the Thebans mightier men,  
More eager by far for the business of war. Now, therefore, receive this punch on the head.

 

ÆSCH.  Ah, *ye* might have practised the same yourselves, but ye turned to other pursuits instead.  
Then next the “Persians” I wrote, in praise of the noblest deed that the world can show,  
And each man longed for the victor’s wreath, to fight and to vanquish his country’s foe.

 

DIO.  I was pleased, I own, when I heard their moan for old Darius, their great king, dead;  
When they smote together their hands, like this, and Evir *alake* the Chorus said.

 

ÆSCH.  Aye, such are the poet’s appropriate works: and just consider how all along  
From the very first they have wrought you good, the noble bards, the masters of song.  
First, Orpheus taught you religious rites, and from bloody murder to stay your hands:  
Musaeus healing and oracle lore; and Hesiod all the culture of lands, The time to gather, the time to plough. And gat not Homer his glory divine  
By singing of valour, and honour, and right, and the sheen of the battle-extended line,  
The ranging troops and the arming of men?  DIO. O, aye, but he didn’t teach *that,* I opine,  
To Pantacles; when he was leading the show I couldn’t imagine what he was at,  
He had fastened his helm on the top of his head, he was trying to fasten his plume upon that.

 

ÆSCH.  But others, many and brave, he taught, of whom was Lamachus, hero true;  
And thence my spirit the impress took, and many a lion-heart chief I drew,  
Patrocluses, Teucers, illustrious names; for I fain the citizen-folk would spur  
To stretch themselves to *their* measure and height, whenever the trumpet of war they hear.  
But Phædras and Stheneboeas? No\! no harlotry business deformed my plays.  
And none can say that ever I drew a love-sick woman in all my days.

 

EUR.  For *you* no lot or portion had got in Queen Aphrodite.  ÆSCH. Thank Heaven for that.  
But ever on you and yours, my friend, the mighty goddess mightily sat; Yourself she cast to the ground at last.  DIO. O, aye, that came uncommonly pat.  
You showed how cuckolds are made, and lo, you were struck yourself by the very same fate.

 

EUR.  But say, you cross-grained censor of mine, how *my* Stheneboeas could harm the state.

 

ÆSCH.  Full many a noble dame, the wife of a noble citizen, hemlock took,  
And died, unable the shame and sin of your Bellerophon-scenes to brook.

 

EUR.  Was then, I wonder, the tale I told of Phædra’s passionate love untrue?

 

ÆSCH.  Not so: but tales of incestuous vice the sacred poet should hide from view,  
Nor ever exhibit and blazon forth on the public stage to the public ken.  
For boys a teacher at school is found, but we, the poets, are teachers of men.  
We are BOUND things honest and pure to speak.  EUR. And to speak great Lycabettuses, pray,  
And massive blocks of Parnassian rocks, is *that* things honest and pure to say?  
In human fashion we ought to speak.  ÆSCH. Alas, poor witling, and can’t you see  
That for mighty thoughts and heroic aims, the words themselves must appropriate be?  
And grander belike on the ear should strike the speech of heroes and godlike powers,  
Since even the robes that invest their limbs are statelier, grander robes than ours.  
Such was *my* plan: but when you began, you spoilt and degraded it all.  EUR. How so?

 

ÆSCH.  Your kings in tatters and rags you dressed, and brought them on, a beggarly show,  
To move, forsooth, our pity and ruth.  EUR. And what was the harm, I should like to know.

 

ÆSCH.  No more will a wealthy citizen now equip for the state a galley of war.  
He wraps his limbs in tatters and rags, and whines *he is poor, too poor by far.*

 

DIO.  But under his rags he is wearing a vest, as woolly and soft as a man could wish.  
Let him gull the stated and he’s off to the mart; an eager, extravagant buyer of fish.

 

ÆSCH.  Moreover, to prate, to harangue, to debate, is now the ambition of all in the state.  
Each exercise-ground is in consequence found deserted and empty: to evil repute  
Your lessons have brought our youngsters, and taught our sailors to challenge, discuss, and refute  
The orders they get from their captains, and yet, when *I* was alive, I protest that the knaves  
Knew nothing at all, save for rations to call, and to sing “Rhyppapae” as they pulled through the waves.

 

DIO.  And, bedad, to let fly from their sterns in the eye of the fellow who tugged at the undermost oar,  
And a jolly young messmate with filth to besmirch, and to land for a filching adventure ashore;  
But now they harangue, and dispute, and won’t row,  
And idly and aimlessly float to and fro.

 

ÆSCH.  Of what ills is he not the creator and cause?  
Consider the scandalous scenes that he draws,  
His bawds, and his panders, his women who give,  
 Give birth in the sacredest shrine,  
Whilst other with brothers are wedded and bedded,  
     And others opine  
That “not to be living’ is truly “to live.”  
And therefore our city is swarming to-day  
With clerks and with demagogue-monkeys, who play  
Their jackanape tricks at all times, in all places,  
Deluding the people of Athens; but none  
Has training enough in athletics to run  
 With the torch in his hand at the races.

 

DIO.  By the Powers, you are right\! At the Panathenaea  
I laughed till I felt like a postherd to see a  
Pale, paunchy young gentlemen pounding along,  
With his head butting forward, the last of the throng,  
In the direst of straits; and, behold, at the gates,  
The Ceramites flapped him, and smacked him, and slapped him,  
In the ribs, and the loin, and the flank, and the groin,  
And still, as they spanked him, he puffed and he panted,  
Till at one mighty cuff, he discharged such a puff  
That he blew out his torch and levanted.

 

CHOR. Dread the battle, and stout the combat, mighty and manifold looms the war.  
Hard to decide in the fight they’re waging,  
One like a stormy tempest raging,  
One alert in the rally and skirmish, clever to parry and foin and spar.  
Nay, but don’t be content to sit  
Always in one position only: many the fields for your keen-edged wit.  
On then, wrangle in every way.  
Argue, battle, be flayed and flay,  
Old and new from your stores display,  
Yea, and strive with venturesome daring something subtle and neat to say.  
Fear ye this, that to-day’s spectators lack the grace of artistic lore,  
Lack the knowledge they need for taking  
All the points ye will soon be making?  
Fear it not: the alarm is groundless: that, be sure, is the case no more.  
All have fought the campaign ere this:  
Each a book of the words is holding; never a single point they’ll miss.  
Bright their natures, and now, I ween,  
Newly whetted, and sharp, and keen.  
Dread not any defect of wit,  
Battle away without misgiving, sure that the audience, at least, are fit.

 

EUR.  Well, then, I’ll turn me to your prologues now,  
Beginning first to test the first beginning  
Of this fine poet’s plays. Why, he’s obscure  
Even in the enunciation of the facts.

 

DIO.  Which of them will you test?  EUR. Many: but first  
Give us that famous one from the “Oresteia.”

 

DIO.  St\! Silence, all\! Now, Æschylus, begin.

 

ÆSCH.  *Grave Hermes, witnessing a father’s power,*  
*Be thou my saviour and mine aid to-day,*  
*For here I come and hither I return.*

 

DIO.  Any fault there?  EUR. A dozen faults, and more.

 

DIO.  Eh\! why, the lines are only three in all.

 

EUR.  But every one contains a score of faults.

 

DIO.  Now, Æschylus, keep silent; if you don’t,  
You won’t get off with three iambic lines.

 

ÆSCH.  Silent for *him\!*  DIO. If *my* advice you’ll take.

 

EUR.  Why, at first starting, here’s a fault sky-high.

 

ÆSCH.  \(*To Dio.*\) You see your folly?  DIO. Have your way; I Care not.

 

ÆSCH.  \(*To Eur.*\) What is my fault?  EUR. Begin the lines again.

 

ÆSCH.  *Grave Hermes, witnessing a father’s power — *

 

EUR.  And this beside his murdered father’s grave  
Orestes speaks?  ÆSCH. I say not otherwise.

 

EUR.  Then does he mean that when his father fell  
By craft and violence at a woman’s hand,  
The god of craft was witnessing the deed?

 

ÆSCH.  It was not he: it was the Helper Hermes  
He called the grave: and this he showed by adding  
It was his sire’s prerogative he held.

 

EUR.  Why, this is worse than all. If from his father  
He held this office grave, why, then — DIO. He was  
A graveyard rifler on his father’s side.

 

ÆSCH.  Bacchus, the wine you drink is stale and fusty.

 

DIO.  give him another: \(*To Eur.*\) you, look out for faults.

 

ÆSCH.  *Be thou my saviour and mine aid to-day,*  
*For here I come, and hither I return.*

 

EUR.  The same thing twice says clever Æschylus.

 

DIO.  How twice?  EUR. Why, just consider: I’ll explain.  
“I come,” says he; and “I return,” says he:  
It’s the same thing to “come” and to “return.”

 

DIO.  Aye, just as if you said, “Good fellow, lend me  
A kneading-trough: likewise, a trough to knead in.”

 

ÆSCH.  It is not so, you everlasting talker,  
They’re not the same, the words are right enough.

 

DIO.  How so? inform me how you use the words.

 

ÆSCH.  A man, not banished from his home, may “come”  
To any land, with no especial chance.  
A home-bound exile both “returns” and “comes.”

 

DIO.  O, good, by Apollo\!  
What do you say, Euripides, to that?

 

EUR.  I say Orestes never did “return.”  
He came in secret: nobody recalled him.

 

DIO.  O, good, by Hermes\!  
\(*Aside.*\) I’ve not the least suspicion what he means.

 

EUR.  Repeat another line.  DIO. Aye, Æschylus,  
Repeat one instantly: *you,* mark what’s wrong.

 

ÆSCH.  *Now on this funeral mound I call my father*  
*To hear, to hearken.*  EUR. There he is again.  
To “hear,” to “hearken”; the same thing, exactly.

 

DIO.  Aye, but he’s speaking to the dead, you knave,  
Who cannot hear us though we call them thrice.

 

ÆSCH.  And how do you make *your* prologues?  EUR. You shall hear;  
And if you find one single thing said twice,  
Or any useless padding, spit upon me.

 

DIO.  Well, fire away: I’m all agog to hear  
Your very accurate and faultless prologues.

 

EUR.  *A happy man was Oedipus at first — *

 

ÆSCH.  Not so, by Zeus; a most unhappy man,  
Who, not yet born nor yet conceived. Apollo  
Foretold would be his father’s murderer.  
How could he be a happy man at first?

 

EUR.  *Then he became the wretchedest of men.*

 

ÆSCH.  Not so, by Zeus; he never ceased to be.  
No sooner born, than they exposed the babe  
\(And that in winter\), in an earthen crock,  
Lest he should grown a man, and slay his father.  
Then with both ankles pierced and swoln, he limped  
Away to Polybus: still young, he married  
An ancient crone, and her his mother too;  
The scratched out both his eyes.  DIO. Happy indeed  
Had he been Erasinides’ colleague\!

 

EUR.  Nonsense; I say my prologues are first-rate.

 

ÆSCH.  Nay, then, by Zeus, no longer line by line  
I’ll maul your phrases: but with heaven to aid  
I’ll smash your prologues with a bottle of oil.

 

EUR.  You mine with a bottle of oil?

 

ÆSCH.  With only one.  
You frame your prologues so that each and all  
Fit in with a “bottle of oil,” or “coverlet-skin,”  
Or “reticule-bag.” I’ll prove it here, and now.

 

EUR.  You’ll prove it? You?  ÆSCH. I will.  DIO. Well, then, begin.

 

EUR.  *Aegyptus, sailing with his fifty sons,*  
*As ancient legends mostly tell the tale,*  
*Touching at Argos,*  ÆSCH. Lost his bottle of oil.

 

EUR.  Hang it, what’s that? Confound that bottle of oil\!

 

DIO.  Give him another: let him try again.

 

EUR.  *Bacchus, who, clad in fawnskins, leaps and bounds*  
*With torch and thyrsus in the choral dance*  
*Along Parnassus.*  ÆSCH. Lost his bottle of oil.

 

DIO.  Ah me, we are stricken — with that bottle again\!

 

EUR.  Pooh, pooh, that’s nothing. I’ve a prologue here,  
He’ll never tack his bottle of oil to this:  
*No man is blest in every single thing.*  
*One is of noble birth, but lacking means.*  
*Another, baseborn,*  ÆSCH. Lost his bottle of oil.

 

DIO.  Euripedes\!  EUR. Well?  DIO. Lower your sails, my boy;  
This bottle of oil is going to blow a gale.

 

EUR.  O, by Demeter, I don’t care one bit;  
Now from his hands I’ll strike that bottle of oil.

 

DIO.  Go on then, go; but ware the bottle of oil.

 

EUR.  *Once Cadmus, quitting the Sidonian town,*  
*Agenor’s offspring*  ÆSCH. Lost his bottle of oil.

 

DIO.  O, pray, my man, buy off that bottle of oil,  
Or else he’ll smash our prologues all to bits.

 

EUR.  I buy of *him?*  DIO. If *my* advice you’ll take.

 

EUR.  No, no I’ve many a prologue yet to say,  
To which he can’t tack on his bottle of oil.  
*Pelops, the son of Tantalus, while driving*  
*His mares to Pisa*  ÆSCH. Lost his bottle of oil.

 

DIO.  There\! he tacked on the bottle of oil again.  
O, for heaven’s sake, pay him its price, dear boy;  
You’ll get it for an obol, spick-and-span.

 

EUR.  Not yet, by Zeus; I’ve plenty of prologues left.  
*Oeneus once reaping*  ÆSCH. Lost his bottle of oil.

 

EUR.  Pray let me finish one entire line first.  
*Oeneus once reaping an abundant harvest,*  
*Offering the firstfruits*  ÆSCH. Lost his bottle of oil.

 

DIO.  What, in the act of offering? Fie\! Who stole it?

 

EUR.  O, don’t keep bothering\! Let him try with this\!  
*Zeus, as by Truth’s own voice the tale is told,*

 

DIO.  No, he’ll cut in with “Lost his bottle of oil.”  
Those bottles of oil on all your prologues seem  
To gather and grow, like styes upon the eye.  
Turn to his melodies now, for goodness’ sake.

 

EUR.  O, I can easily show that he’s a poor  
Melody-maker; makes them all alike.

 

*CHOR.*    What, O, what will be done\!  
Strange to think that he dare  
Blame the bard who has won,  
More than all in our days,  
Fame and praise for his lays,  
Lays so many and fair.  
Much I marvel to hear  
What the charge he will bring  
‘Gainst our tragedy king;  
Yea, for himself do I fear.

 

EUR.  Wonderful lays\! O, yes, you’ll see directly.  
I’ll cut down all his metrical strains to one.

 

DIO.  And I, I’ll take some pebbles, and keep count.  
\(*A slight pause, during which the music of a flute is heard. The music continues to the end of line 1277 as an accompaniment to the recitative.*\)

 

EUR.  Lord of Phthia, Achilles, *why, hearing the voice of the hero-dividing,*  
*Hah\! smiting\! approachest thou not to the rescue?*  
We, by the lake who *abide, are adoring our ancestor Hermes.*  
*Hah\! smiting\! approachest thou not to the rescue?*

 

DIO.      O Æschylus, twice art thou smitten\!

 

EUR.  Hearken to me, great king; yea, hearken, *Atreides, thou noblest of all the Achaeans.*  
*Hah\! smiting\! approachest thou not to the rescue?*

 

DIO.  Thrice, Æschylus, thrice art thou smitten\!

 

EUR.  Hush\! the bee-wardens are here: they *will quickly the Temple of Artemis open.*  
*Hah\! smiting\! approachest thou not to the rescue?*  
I will expound \(for *I know it*\) *the omen the chieftains encountered.*  
*Hah\! smiting\! approachest thou not to the rescue?*

 

DIO.  O Zeus and King, the terrible lot of smitings\!  
I’ll to the bath: I’m very sure my kidneys  
Are quite inflamed and swoln with all these smitings.

 

EUR.  Wait till you’ve heard another batch of lays  
Culled from his lyre-accompanied melodies.

 

DIO.  Go on then, go: but no more smitings, please.

 

EUR.  How the twin-throned powers of *Achaea, the lords of the mighty*  
Hellenes.  
O phlattothrattophlattothrat\!  
Sendeth *the Sphinx, the unchancy, the chieftainess blood-hound.*  
O phlattothrattophlattothrat\!  
Launcheth fierce with brand *and hand the avengers the terrible eagle.*  
O phlattothrattophlattothrat\!  
So for the swift-*winged hounds of the air he provided a booty.*  
O phlattothrattophlattothrat\!  
The throng down-bearing on Aias.  
O phlattothrattophlattothrat\!

 

DIO.  Whence comes that phlattothrat? From Marathon, or  
Where picked you up these cable-twister’s strains?

 

ÆSCH.  From noblest source for noblest ends I brought them,  
Unwilling in the Muses’ holy field  
The selfsame flowers as Phrynichus to cull.  
But *he* from all things rotten draws his lays,  
From Carian flutings, catches of Meletus,  
Dance-music, dirges. You shall hear directly.  
Bring me the lyre. Yet wherefore need a lyre  
For songs like these? Where’s she that bangs and jangles  
Her castanets? Euripides’ Muse,  
Present yourself: fit goddess for fit verse.

 

DIO.  The Muse herself can’t be a wanton? No\!

 

ÆSCH.  Halcyons, who by the ever-rippling  
Waves of the sea are babbling,  
Dewing your plumes with the drops that fall  
From wings in the salt spray dabbling.  
Spiders, ever with twir-r-r-r-r-rling fingers  
Weaving the warp and the woof,  
Little, brittle, network, fretwork,  
Under the coigns of the roof.  
The minstrel shuttle’s care.  
Where in the front of the dark-prowed ships  
Yarely the flute-loving dolphin skips.  
Races here and oracles there.  
And the joy of the young vines smiling,  
And the tendril of grapes, care-beguiling.  
O, embrace me, my child O, embrace me.  
\(*To Dio.*\) You see this foot?  DIO. I do.

 

ÆSCH.  And this?  DIO. And that one too.

 

ÆSCH.  \(*To Eur.*\) You, such stuff who compile,  
Dare my songs to upbraid;  
You, whose songs in the style  
Of Cyrene’s embraces are made.  
So much for them: but still I’d like to show  
The way in which your monodies are framed.  
“O darkly-light mysterious Night,  
What may this Vision mean,  
Sent from the world unseen  
With baleful omens rife;  
A thing of lifeless life,  
A child of sable night,  
A ghastly curdling sight,  
In black funereal veils,  
With murder, murder in its eyes,  
And great enormous nails?  
Light ye the lanterns, my maidens, and dipping your jugs in the stream,  
Draw me the dew of the water, and heat it to boiling and steam;  
So will I wash me away the ill effects of my dream.  
God of the sea\!  
My dream’s come true.  
Ho, lodgers, ho,  
This portent view.  
Glyce has vanished, carrying off my cock,  
My cock that crew\!

 

O Mania, help\! O Oreads of the rock,  
Pursue\! pursue\!  
For I, poor girl, was working within,  
Holding my distaff heavy and full,  
Twir-r-r-r-r-rling my hand as the threads I spin,  
Weaving an excellent bobbin of wool;  
Thinking, ‘To-morrow I’ll go to the fair,  
In the dusk of the morn, and be selling it there.’  
But he to the blue upflew, upflew,  
On the lightliest tips of his wings outspread;  
To me he bequeathed but woe, but woe,  
And tears, sad tears, from my eyes o’erflow,  
Which I, the bereaved, must shed, must shed.  
O children of Ida, sons of Crete,  
Grasping your bows, to the rescue come;  
Twinkle about on your restless feet,  
Stand in a circle around her home.

 

O Artemis, thou maid divine,  
Dictynna, huntress, fair to see,  
O, bring that keen-nosed pack of thine,  
And hunt through all the house with me.

 

O Hecate, with flameful brands,

 

O Zeus’ daughter, arm thine hands  
Those swiftliest hands, both right and left;  
Thy rays on Glyce’s cottage throw  
That I serenely there may go  
And search by moonlight for the theft.”

 

DIO.  Enough of both your odes.  ÆSCH. Enough for me.  
Now would I bring the fellow to the scales.  
That, that alone, shall test our poetry now,  
And prove whose words are weightiest, his or mine.

 

DIO.  Then both come hither, since I needs must weigh  
The art poetic like a pound of cheese.

 

CHOR.  O, the labour these wits go through\!  
O, the wild, extravagant, new,  
Wonderful things they are going to do\!  
Who but they would ever have thought of it?  
Why, if a man had happened to meet me  
Out in the street, and intelligence brought of it,  
I should have thought he was trying to cheat me;  
Thought that his story was false and deceiving.  
That were a tale I could never believe in.

 

DIO.  Each of you stand beside his scale,  ÆSCH. and EUR. We’re here

 

DIO.  And grasp it firmly whilst ye speak your lines,  
And don’t let go until I cry “Cuckoo.”

 

ÆSCH.  and EUR. Ready\!  DIO. Now speak your lines into the scale.

 

EUR.  *O, that the Argo had not winged her way — *

 

ÆSCH.  *River Spercheius, cattle-grazing haunts — *

 

DIO.  *Cuckoo\! let go. O, look by far the lowest*  
His scale sinks down.  EUR. Why, how came that about?

 

DIO.  He threw a river in, like some wool-seller  
Wetting his wool, to make it weight the more.  
But you threw in a light and wingèd word.

 

EUR.  Come, let him match another verse with mine.

 

DIO.  Each to his scale.  ÆSCH. and EUR. We’re ready.  DIO. Speak your lines.

 

EUR.  *Persuasion’s only shrine is eloquent speech.*

 

ÆSCH.  *Death loves not gifts, alone amongst the gods.*

 

DIO.  Let go, let go. Down goes his scale again.  
He threw in Death, the heaviest ill of all.

 

EUR.  And I Persuasion, the most lovely word.

 

DIO.  A vain and empty sound, devoid of sense.  
Think of some heavier-weighted line of yours,  
To drag your scale down: something strong and big.

 

EUR.  Where have I got one? Where? Let’s see. Dio I’ll tell you.  
*“Achilles threw two singles and a four.”*  
Come, speak your lines: this is your last set-to.

 

EUR.  *In his right hand he grasped an iron-clamped mace.*

 

ÆSCH.  *Chariot on chariot, corpse on corpse was hurled.*

 

DIO.  There now\! again he has done you.  EUR. Done me? How?

 

DIO.  He threw tow chariots and two corpses in;  
Five-score Egyptians could not lift that weight.

 

ÆSCH.  No more of “line for line”; let him — himself,  
His children, wife, Cephisophon — get in,  
With all his books collected in his arms,  
Two lines of mine shall overweigh the lot.

 

DIO.  Both are my friends; I can’t decide between them:  
I don’t desire to be at odds with either:  
One is so clever, one delights me so.

 

PLUTO.  Then you’ll effect nothing for which you came?

 

DIO.  And how, if I decide?  PLUTO. Then take the winner;  
So will your journey not be made in vain.

 

DIO.  Heaven bless your Highness\! Listen, I came down  
After a poet.  EUR. To what end?  DIO. That so  
The city, saved, may keep her choral games.  
Now then, whichever of you two shall best  
Advise the city, *he* shall come with me.  
And first of Alcibiades, let each  
Say what he thinks; the city travails sore.

 

EUR.  What does she think herself about him?  DIO. What?  
She loves, and hates, and longs to have him back.  
But give me *your* advice about the man.

 

EUR.  I loathe a townsman who is slow to aid,  
And swift to hurt, his town; who ways and means  
Finds for himself, but finds not for the state.

 

DIO.  Poseidon, but that’s smart\! \(*To Æsch.*\) And what say *you?*

 

ÆSCH.  ‘Twere best to rear no lion in the state:  
But having reared, ’tis best to humour him.

 

DIO.  By Zeus the Saviour, still I can’t decide.  
One is so clever, and so clear the other.  
But once again. Let each in turn declare  
What plan of safety for the state ye’ve got.

 

EUR.  \[First with Cinesias wing Cleocritus,  
Then zephyrs waft them o’er the watery plain.

 

DIO.  As funny sight, I own: but where’s the sense?

 

EUR.  If, when the fleets engage, they, holding cruets,  
Should rain down vinegar in the foemen’s eyes,\]  
I know, and I can tell you.  DIO. Tell away.

 

EUR.  When things, mistrusted now, shall trusted be,  
And trusted things, mistrusted.  DIO. How\! I don’t  
Quite comprehend. Be clear, and not so clever.

 

EUR.  If we mistrust those citizens of ours  
Whom now we trust, and those employ whom now  
We don’t employ, the city will be saved.  
If on our present tack we fail, we surely  
Shall find salvation in the opposite course.

 

DIO.  Good, O Palamedes\! Good, you genius you.  
\[Is this *your* cleverness or Cephisophon’s?

 

EUR.  This is my own: the cruet-plan was his.\]

 

DIO.  \(*To Æsch.*\) Now, you,  ÆSCH. But tell me whom the city uses. The good and useful?  DIO. What are you dreaming of?  
She hates and loathes them.  ÆSCH. Does she love the bad?

 

DIO.  Not love them, no: she uses them perforce.

 

ÆSCH.  How can one save a city such as this,  
Whom neither frieze nor woollen tunic suits?

 

DIO.  O, if to earth you rise, find out some way.

 

ÆSCH.  There will I speak: I cannot answer here.

 

DIO.  Nay, nay; send up your guerdon from below.

 

ÆSCH.  When they shall count the enemy’s soil their own,  
And theirs the enemy’s: “when they know that ships  
Are their true wealth, their so-called wealth delusion.

 

DIO.  Aye, but the justices suck that down, you know.

 

PLUTO.  Now then, decide.  DIO. I will; and thus I’ll do it:  
I’ll choose the man in whom my soul delights.

 

EUR.  O, recollect the gods by whom you swore  
You’d take me home again; and choose your friends.

 

DIO.  ’Twas my tongue swore; my choice is — Æschylus.

 

EUR.  Hah\! what have you done?  DIO. Done? Given the victor’s prize  
To Æschylus; why not?  EUR. And do you dare  
Look in my face, after that shameful deed?

 

DIO.  What’s shameful, if the audience think not so?

 

EUR.  Have you no heart? Wretch, would you leave me dead?

 

DIO.  Who knows if death be life, and life be death,  
And breath be mutton broth, and sleep a sheepskin?

 

PLUTO.  Now, Dionysus, come ye in,  DIO. What for?

 

PLUTO.  And sup before ye go.  DIO. A bright idea. I’ faith, I’m nowise indisposed for that.

 

CHOR.    Blest the man who possesses a  
Keen intelligent mind.  
This full often we find.  
He, the bard of renown,  
Now to earth reascends,  
Goes, a joy to his town,  
Goes, a joy to his friends,  
Just because he possesses a  
Keen intelligent mind.

 

RIGHT it is and befitting,  
Not, by Socrates sitting,  
Idle talk to pursue,  
Stripping tragedy-art of  
All things noble and true,  
Surely the mind to school  
Fine-drawn quibbles to seek,  
Fine-set phrases to speak,  
Is but the part of a fool\!

 

PLUTO. Farewell then, Æschylus, great and wise,  
Go, save our state by the maxims rare  
Of thy noble thought; and the fools chastise,  
For many a fool dwells there.  
And *this* to Cleophon give, my friend,  
And *this* to the revenue-raising crew,  
Nicomachus, Myrmex, next I send,  
And *this* to Archenomus too.  
And bid them all that without delay,  
To my realm of the dead they hasten away.  
For if they loiter above, I swear  
I’ll come myself and arrest them there.  
And branded and fettered the slaves shall go  
With the vilest rascal in all the town,  
Adeimantus, son of Leucolophus, down,  
Down, down to the darkness below.

 

ÆSCH.  I take the mission. This chair of mine  
Meanwhile to Sophocles here commit  
\(For I count him next in our craft divine\),  
Till I come once more by thy side to sit.  
But as for that rascally scoundrel there,  
That low buffoon, that worker of ill,  
O, let him not sit in my vacant chair,  
Not even against his will.

 

PLUTO. \(*To the Chorus.*\) Escort him up with your mystic throngs,  
While the holy torches quiver and blaze.  
Escort him up with his own sweet songs  
And his noble festival lays.

 

CHOR.  First, as the poet triumphant is passing away to the light,  
Grant him success on his journey, ye powers that are ruling below.  
Grant that he find for the city good counsels to guide her aright;  
So we at last shall be freed from the anguish, the fear, and the woe,  
Freed from the onsets of war. Let Cleophon now and his band  
Battle, if battle they must, far away in their own fatherland.
