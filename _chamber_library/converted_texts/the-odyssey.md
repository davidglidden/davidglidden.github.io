[[INTRODUCTION]{.calibre2}](#index_split_005.html_filepos1623)

[The Odyssey]{.italic} is, along with [The Iliad]{.italic}, one of the two oldest works of literature in the Western tradition. It is an epic poem: "epic" both in the sense that it is long, and in the sense that it presents itself as telling an important story, in the traditional, formulaic language used by archaic poets for singing the tales of gods, wars, journeys, and the collective memories and experience of the Greek-speaking world.

Modern connotations of the word "epic" are in some ways misleading when we turn to the Homeric poems, the texts that began the Western epic tradition. The Greek word [epos]{.italic} means simply "word" or "story" or "song." It is related to a verb meaning "to say" or "to tell," which is used (in a form with a prefix) in the first line of the poem. The narrator commands the Muse, "Tell me": [enn-epe.]{.italic} An epic poem is, at its root, simply a tale that is told.

[The Odyssey]{.italic} is grand or (in modern terms) "epic" in scope: it is over twelve thousand lines long. The poem is elevated in style, composed entirely in a regular poetic rhythm, a six-beat line (dactylic hexameter), and its vocabulary was not that used by ordinary Greeks in everyday speech, in any time or place. The language contains a strange mixture of words from different periods of time, and from Greek dialects associated with different regions. A handful of words in Homer were incomprehensible to Greeks of the classical period. The syntax is relatively simple, but the words and phrases, in these combinations, are unlike the way that anybody ever actually spoke. The style is, from a modern perspective, strange: it is full of repetitions, redundancies, and formulaic expressions. These mark the poem's debt to a long tradition of storytelling and suggest that we are in a world that is at least partly continuous with a distant, half-forgotten past.

But in some ways, the story told in this long piece of verse is small and ordinary. It is a story, as the first word of the original Greek tells us, about "a man" ([andra]{.italic}). He is not "the" man, but one of many men---albeit a man of extraordinary cognitive, psychological, and military power, one who can win any competition, outwit any opponent, and manage, against all odds, to survive. The poem tells us how he makes his circuitous way back home across stormy seas after many years at war. We may expect the hero of an "epic" narrative to confront evil forces, perform a superhuman task, and rescue vast numbers of people from an extraordinary kind of threat. Failing that, we might hope at least for a great quest unexpectedly achieved, despite perils all around; an action that saves the world, or at least changes it in some momentous way---like Jason claiming the Golden Fleece, Launcelot glimpsing the Holy Grail, or Aeneas beginning the foundation of Rome. In [The Odyssey]{.italic}, we find instead the story of a man whose grand adventure is simply to go back to his own home, where he tries to turn everything back to the way it was before he went away. For this hero, mere survival is the most amazing feat of all.

Only a portion of the twenty-four books of [The Odyssey]{.italic} describes the magical wanderings of Odysseus on his journey back to Ithaca. These adventures are presented as a backstory partly told by the hero himself (in Books 5 through 12). The poem cuts between far-distant and diverse locations, from Olympus to earth, from Calypso's island to the palace at Ithaca, from the underworld to the cottage of the swineherd. Sometimes the setting feels entirely realistic, even mundane---a world where a mother packs a wholesome lunch of bread and cheese for her daughter, where there is a particular joy in taking a hot bath, where men listen to music and play checkers, and lively, pretty girls have fun playing ball games together. At other moments, we are in the realm of pure fantasy, inhabited by cannibals, witches, and goddesses with six barking heads, where it is possible to cross the streams of Ocean (the mythical river that encircles the known world), and come to the land of asphodel, where the spirits of dead heroes live forever. Different characters tell their own inset stories---some true, some false, of past lives, adventures, dreams, memories, and troubles. The poem weaves and unweaves a multilayered narrative that is both simple and artful in its patterning and composition.

The story begins in an unexpected place, [in medias res]{.italic} ("in the middle of things"---the proper starting point for an epic, according to Horace). It is not the start of the Trojan War, which began with the Judgment of Paris and the Abduction of Helen and was fought for ten years. Nor does the poem start at the beginning of Odysseus' journey home, which has been in progress for almost as many years as the war. Instead, it begins when nothing much seems to be happening at all; Odysseus, his son, and his wife are all stuck in a state of frustration and paralysis that has been continuing for years and is becoming unbearable.

Odysseus, at the start of the poem, is trapped by the goddess Calypso, who wants to have him stay there as her husband for eternity. He could choose to evade death and old age and stay always with her; but movingly, he prefers "to see even just the smoke that rises / from his own homeland, and he wants to die." Odysseus longs to recover his own identity, not as a victim of shipwreck or a coddled plaything of a powerful goddess, but as a master of his home and household, as a father and as a husband. He sits sobbing by the shore of the island every day, desperately staring at the "fruitless sea" for a boat that might take him back home.

Meanwhile, in Ithaca, Odysseus' wife, Penelope, is surrounded by young men who have forced their way into her home and are making merry with daily feasts, wasting the provisions of the household, waiting for her to agree to give up on Odysseus and marry one of them. Penelope has a deep loyalty both to her lost husband, for whom she weeps every night and whom she misses "all the time," and also to the "beautiful rich house" in which she lives, which she risks losing forever if she remarries. She has devised clever ways to put off the suitors, but it is clear that she cannot do so forever; eventually, she will have to choose one of them as her husband and perhaps leave the household of Odysseus for a new home. When that happens, either the suitors will divide the wealth of Odysseus between them---as they sometimes threaten---or the dominant suitor may gain the throne of Ithaca for himself. The ambiguity about what the suitors are seeking matches an even more central ambiguity, about what Penelope herself wants. Indefinitely, tearfully, Penelope waits, keeping everyone guessing about her innermost feelings and intentions. As the chief suitor complains, "She offers hope to all, sends notes to each, / but all the while her mind moves somewhere else." This premise allows for artful resonances with earlier moments in the myth of Troy. Much-courted Penelope resembles Helen, the woman to whom all the Greek heroes came as suitors (Menelaus, her husband, eventually won her hand by lot), and whom Paris, Prince of Troy, later stole away. Like Paris, Penelope's suitors threaten to steal away a married woman as if she were a bride. Penelope's house also echoes the besieged town of Troy, when the Greeks were fighting to take Helen back home---but there is here no strong Hector to defend the inhabitants.

Telemachus, Odysseus' almost-adult son, is in a particularly precarious situation. Left as a "little newborn baby" when Odysseus sailed for Troy, he must be twenty or twenty-one years old at the time of the poem's action, but he seems in many ways younger. To fight off the suitors and take control of the household himself, he would need great physical and emotional strength, a strong group of supporters, and the capacity to plan a difficult military and political operation---none of which he possesses. Telemachus must complete several difficult quests in the course of the poem: to survive the mortal danger posed by the suitors; to mature and grow up to manhood; to find his lost father, and help him regain control of the house. The journey with which the story begins is not that of Odysseus himself but of Telemachus, who sets out to find news of his absent father. The son's odyssey away from home parallels the father's quest in the opposite direction. The poem intertwines the story of these three central characters---the father, the mother, the son---and shows us how something different is at stake for each of them, in the gradual and difficult struggle to rebuild their lost nuclear family.

[The Odyssey]{.italic} puts us into a world that is a peculiar mixture of the strange and the familiar. The tension between strangeness and familiarity is in fact the poem's central subject. Its setting, in the islands of the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas, would have been vaguely familiar to any Greek-speaking reader; but this version of the region includes sea-monsters and giants who eat humans, as well as gods who walk the earth and talk with select favorites among the mortals. We encounter a surprisingly varied range of different characters and types of incident: giants and beggars, arrogant young men and vulnerable old slaves, a princess who does laundry and a dead warrior who misses the sunshine, gods, goddesses, and ghosts, brave deeds, love affairs, spells, dreams, songs, and stories. Odysseus himself seems to contain multitudes: he is a migrant, a pirate, a carpenter, a king, an athlete, a beggar, a husband, a lover, a father, a son, a fighter, a liar, a leader, and a thief. He is a man who cries, takes naps, and feels homesick, but he is also a man who has a special relationship with the goddess who transforms his appearance at will and ensures that his schemes succeed. The poem promotes but also questions its own fantasies and ideals, such as the idea that time and change can be undone, and the notion that there is such a thing as home, where people and relationships can stay forever the same.

[Who Was Homer?]{.calibre1}

The authorship of the Homeric poems is a complex and difficult topic, because these written texts emerge from a long oral tradition. Marks of this distinctive legacy are visible in [The Odyssey]{.italic} on the level of style. Dawn appears some twenty times in [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic}, and the poem repeats the same line, word for word, each time: [emos d'erigeneia phane rhododaktulos eos]{.italic}: "But when early-born rosy-fingered Dawn appeared . . ." There is a vast array of such formulaic expressions in Homeric verse, which suggest that things have an eternal, infinitely repeatable presence. Different things will happen every day, but Dawn always appears, always with rosy fingers, always early. Characters and objects all have their own descriptive terms in Homer; these are known as epithets, rather than adjectives, because they express an essential quality or characteristic, rather than a trait that the object or person possesses only in a particular moment. Ships are "black," "hollow," "swift," or "curved," never "brown," "slow," or "wobbly." Chairs are "well-carved" or "polished," never "uncomfortable" or "expensive." Penelope is "prudent Penelope," never "swift-footed Penelope" even if she is moving quickly. Telemachus is "thoughtful," even when he seems particularly immature. Moreover, many types of scene follow a certain predictable pattern. There is a fixed sequence of events described, with variations, whenever someone gets dressed or puts on armor, whenever a meal is prepared, or whenever a person is killed. Through its formulaic mode, [The Odyssey]{.italic} assures us that, once we know the patterns, the world will follow a predictable rhythm. This feature of the Homeric poems is a mark of their debt to a Greek oral tradition of poetic song that extends back hundreds of years before the poems in their current forms came into existence.

In [The Odyssey]{.italic} itself we meet two singers who play the lyre while they give their performances of traditional tales at the banquets of the rich. The first is Demodocus at the court of King Alcinous of Phaeacia, who tells stories about Odysseus himself and the Trojan Horse, as well as about the affair between the god Ares and the goddess Aphrodite. The second is Phemius, who performs under compulsion for the suitors of Penelope. These characters give us some important insights into the composition of the poem, and the person (or people) who composed it. In an obviously self-interested spirit, [The Odyssey]{.italic} suggests that poets have a particularly honorable place in society. But the singer is also presented as a servant, perhaps a slave, who earns food and a place to rest by giving performances that are enjoyed by wealthy banqueters. Demodocus does not read out his poetry from a script; his inability to do so is underlined by the fact that he is blind (not incidentally, no one in the entire [Odyssey]{.italic} reads or writes anything). Moreover, Demodocus does not invent an original story of his own composition. Instead, Demodocus is inspired by the Muse to sing the "deeds of heroes"---which are, at least in outline, already well-known to his audience. The skill and inspiration of these illiterate singers is shown not in the invention of entirely new stories, but in their ability to retell ancient stories, and to transport their audience to the scenes they describe.

But Homer himself---if there was such a person---was not exactly a Demodocus. A blind, illiterate bard could not, by himself, have written the monumental [Iliad]{.italic} and [Odyssey.]{.italic} Homer is usually described in Greek sources not as a singer ([aoidos]{.italic}) or rhapsode ("song-stitcher"), but as a poet, [poetes]{.italic}---a word that means "maker." Indeed, a normal way to refer to Homer in Greek is as "the Poet"---the name Homer can be omitted, since there is only one primary poet in the canon.

[The Odyssey]{.italic} as we know it is based, like almost all the Graeco-Roman literature we have, on medieval manuscripts. But there is an important difference with this text. The medieval manuscripts of an author like Virgil or Horace are based on earlier manuscripts, based in turn on earlier manuscripts, and so on, each scribe copying the work of a predecessor, and moving back from the medieval codex (a leaved book written on animal skin parchment) to the Byzantine and then ancient papyrus (a scroll written on a kind of thick paper made from papyrus leaves).

[The Odyssey]{.italic} and [The Iliad]{.italic} are different, not only because they are older than other ancient texts, but because of the specific difficulties of understanding how these poems were created---not, or not simply, from the mind of an individual creator, but also from a long oral tradition, which has been transformed into two monumental written texts. How exactly did this process happen? Did a single, particularly talented folk-poet learn to write? Or did an illiterate singer collaborate with scribes? Was there one creator, or many? At what time in the process of composition did writing enter the picture?

This takes us to what is known as the Homeric Question, which is really a whole cluster of questions about the composition of [The Iliad]{.italic} and [The Odyssey]{.italic}. The Question is given a capital Q, because scholars still disagree on some crucial issues even after a couple of centuries of discussion. How exactly did the Homeric poems as we have them emerge from the oral tradition that preceded them? Who was Homer? Was there a single author of [The Odyssey]{.italic}, or several? Did the same person produce [The]{.italic}
[Iliad]{.italic} and [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic}? When exactly did the poems get written down, and how? Can we trace earlier and later parts of the poems, or tie particular passages to different geographical locations? And to what extent do the poems reflect real historical events, cultures, and peoples---a real Trojan War, or the real Mycenean civilization of late Bronze Age Greece (which existed from the sixteenth to the twelfth centuries BCE)? Most generally, how exactly did multiple people over hundreds of years across the Greek-speaking world work together to create this magnificent, challenging, and coherent work of poetic storytelling? Design "by committee" has a very bad name, and yet [The Odyssey]{.italic} seems like an unexpected success. How was it done?

During the Renaissance, when the Homeric poems were rediscovered in Europe, Homer was assumed to have been a writer, in the same way that Virgil or Dante were writers---albeit a writer from an ancient time. But in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, dissenting voices began to emerge. In 1664, the Abbé d'Aubignac attacked Homer, arguing that [The Iliad]{.italic} and [Odyssey]{.italic} were incoherent, immoral, and tasteless poems, cobbled together out of an oral folk tradition. A generation later, the British scholar Richard Bentley studied Homer's language, and proved that it was much earlier than classical (fifth- and fourth-century) Greek, because it still showed traces of a letter of the alphabet that dropped out of the language: the digamma. Bentley argued that "Homer" was a prehistoric oral poet of about 10,000 BCE, whose disparate and rambling songs were not gathered into the epics we have until the late sixth century. Scholars began to apply new methods of historical and linguistic analysis, and to ask new questions about how and when these texts were produced. In his [Prolegomena to Homer]{.italic} of 1795, a pioneering work in this "new philology," Friedrich August Wolf argued that the Homeric poems were transmitted orally, and that they had undergone a long period of change and adaptation, through multiple oral reperformances and multiple reformulations by literate editors to suit changing contemporary tastes. He suggested that the poems, which he saw as the product of "the whole Greek people," were forged into their state of apparent unity only at the stage of transcription. Wolf's new vision initiated a fresh discussion of how the original Homer, or the original building blocks of the poem, might be uncovered out of the text as we have it.

During the nineteenth century, Homeric scholarship was divided between the Analytic and Unitarian schools. The Unitarians opposed Wolf's ideas, largely on literary grounds, and argued that the poems as we have them are not an aggregate of earlier, shorter compositions, but were composed by a lone author with a single overarching structure in mind. The Analysts, by contrast, argued that the epics were produced by many different hands. There were multiple theories about how exactly the compilation took place, and what the original kernel might have been. Some argued that there was an original core narrative, an [ur-Odyssey,]{.italic} which had been encrusted with many later and clumsier accretions; their scholarly task was to strip away the layers of later sub-Homeric narrative and restore the original purity of the poems. Others believed that the poems as we have them are a compilation of originally separate folk stories welded together. The Analysts shared the view that the earlier, more original layers of the poems were superior to the later additions and edits, although they disagreed about where exactly the original Homer could be located in the poems as we have them. Even in more recent times, Homerists have been slow to shake off the notion that earlier means better, as well as to rid themselves of the hope that one might chisel a more perfect poem out of the rough marble of the text we have.

Up until the start of the twentieth century, scholars took the oral roots of Homeric poetry more or less for granted, not fully understanding the degree to which they can help us explain important features of Homeric style and narrative technique. The emergence of Homeric poetry from folk traditions explained its "primitive" style, but the generic and stylistic structures of oral poetry and folk traditions were not examined in a systematic way. The state of Homeric scholarship changed radically and permanently in the early 1930s, when a young American classicist named Milman Parry traveled to the then-Yugoslavia with recording equipment and began to study the living oral tradition of illiterate and semiliterate Serbo-Croat bards, who told poetic folk tales about the mythical and semihistorical events of the Serbian past. Parry died at the age of thirty-three from an accidental gunshot, and research was further interrupted by the Second World War. But Parry's student Albert Lord continued his work on Homer, and published his findings in 1960, under the title [The Singer of Tales]{.italic}. Lord and Parry proved definitively that the Homeric poems show the mark of oral composition.

The "Parry-Lord hypothesis" was that oral poetry, from every culture where it exists, has certain distinctive features, and that we can see these features in the Homeric poems---specifically, in the use of formulae, which enable the oral poet to compose at the speed of speech. A writer can pause for as long as she or he wants, to ponder the most fitting adjective for a particular scene; she can also go back and change it afterwards, on further reflection---as in the famous anecdote about Oscar Wilde, who labored all morning to add a comma, and worked all afternoon taking it out. Oral performers do not use commas, and do not have the luxury of time to ponder their choice of words. They need to be able to maintain fluency, and formulaic features make this possible.

Subsequent studies, building on the work of Parry and Lord, have shown that there are marked differences in the ways that oral and literate cultures think about memory, originality, and repetition. In highly literate cultures, there is a tendency to dismiss repetitive or formulaic discourse as cliché; we think of it as boring or lazy writing. In primarily oral cultures, repetition tends to be much more highly valued. Repeated phrases, stories, or tropes can be preserved to some extent over many generations without the use of writing, allowing people in an oral culture to remember their own past. In Greek mythology, Memory ([Mnemosyne]{.italic}) is said to be the mother of the Muses, because poetry, music, and storytelling are all imagined as modes by which people remember the times before they were born.

It is now generally agreed that, in broad terms, Parry and Lord were right. Many features of the Homeric poems are indeed formulaic (such as those standard "epithets" and those formulaic "type-scenes" of arming or eating), and must have originated from an oral tradition. But there is still a very wide range of opinion about how, exactly, the words of many generations of illiterate and semiliterate bards turned into the written texts of Homer that we have. Several essential factors need to be accounted for by any viable theory. Most obviously, the Homeric poems are written texts, not oral performances. Writing must have played a central part in the process of composition, so it is very misleading to describe [The Odyssey]{.italic} simply as an "oral" poem, as is far too often done. It is a written text based on an oral tradition, which is not at all the same as being an actual oral composition. Moreover, these texts are far too long for any singer to perform them on a single occasion, and far too long for any individual to hold in memory without the use of writing. Songs that had an influence on the Homeric poems were sung for hundreds of years in preliterate Greece; but none of them was [The Odyssey.]{.italic}

These are written texts that display the legacy of a long oral tradition. In important ways the poems are a patchwork. The language is a mishmash of several different dialects, which marks the fact that the Greek singers and storytellers lived and developed their legends in multiple different locations across the Greek-speaking world. Moreover, there are small inconsistencies in the narrative itself, which usually pass unnoticed by the casual reader (such as a slight confusion about how many cloaks Eumaeus possesses, and an apparent switch in who sets up the axes for the contest in which the suitors and Odysseus compete for Penelope's hand). The inconsistencies could mark the text's emergence from multiple different earlier versions of the story of Odysseus, or they might suggest multiple stages of composition and revision, by one poet or by many. Yet despite their mixed language, and despite the few inconsistencies, both [The Iliad]{.italic} and [The Odyssey]{.italic} display striking structural coherence. There is a grand architecture to the storytelling, which might seem to imply the careful planning of a single architect, or architects.

It is possible, as Albert Lord argued, that an oral poet worked closely with a literate scribe or scribes over the course of many days, weeks, or months. On this model, the composition of [The Odyssey]{.italic} may have been not so different from that of [Paradise Lost]{.italic}, composed by a blind poet who dictated his work over a long period to a number of amanuenses. Lord and Parry thought that the composer of the poem could not have been literate, because in the Yugoslavian context, singers who acquired literacy tended to lose their ability to compose oral poetry. But it has now been shown that oral traditions, or "orature," can interact with literacy in a number of different ways, and they are not necessarily driven out as soon as literacy arrives; in Somalia, for example, oral poets have been able to continue their oral compositions even after acquiring literacy. Oral literature is more diverse than Parry, with a single point of cultural comparison, could discern.

Some scholars argue that [The Odyssey]{.italic} was composed by a single person who was well acquainted with the oral tradition but had become literate. This is certainly possible, but there is really no evidence one way or the other. Alternatively, perhaps the poem was composed when one particularly talented illiterate or semiliterate poet (or several) teamed up with a scribe or a group of scribes. Perhaps the scribe or scribes were entirely passive in the process of writing down what the poet composed; or perhaps there was an ongoing collaboration between two or more members of a group. Again, it is difficult to adjudicate between these various possibilities, in the absence of any solid evidence, or a time machine.

The same person could, in theory, have composed [The Iliad]{.italic} and [The Odyssey]{.italic}, though many scholars believe that different individuals wrote the two poems, because they are notably different in terms of language as well as narrative content. It certainly seems likely that the person or people who composed [The Odyssey]{.italic} were aware of [The Iliad]{.italic}, since [The Odyssey]{.italic} supplements but does not repeat any incidents from [The Iliad]{.italic}---which is unlikely to have happened by chance.

Scholars who claim that [The Odyssey]{.italic} was composed by a single person acknowledge that this poet drew on a long and complex set of earlier poetic and folkloric traditions, and that the initial composition underwent considerable alteration in subsequent years, decades, and centuries. Homer---whoever he, she, or they may have been---composed this definitive version of the homecoming of Odysseus with a deep awareness of multiple different versions of the story, as well as a deep knowledge of multiple other parallel folk traditions and myths. For instance, there were probably versions of the story in which Penelope was aware of Odysseus' plans to slaughter the suitors at a much earlier stage, and thus proposed the Contest of the Bow in full knowledge that it would help further her husband's plot. [The Odyssey]{.italic} is also influenced by other related archaic legends, originating both around the Mediterranean and the Near East; for instance, the ancient myth of Jason and the Argonauts seems to hover behind the story of Odysseus and his wanderings.

Maybe an individual genius, a "Homer," had a particularly important role in the creation of [The Odyssey.]{.italic} But we should question the notion that a unified structure and coherent creative product must necessarily be seen as the result of an individual's work. Scholars have tended to assume so, because many long-form narrative genres that we are familiar with, like novels, are produced that way. However, we are also familiar with long narratives that do not have single authors. Many movies, for example, are the product of a team. Most contemporary long-form television drama series are put together by multiple people, even if there is a single creator who came up with the show's initial premise. It may be helpful to think in these terms when considering the authorship of [The Odyssey]{.italic}. Perhaps we are more prepared than readers of the past to approach [The Odyssey]{.italic} as a poem that exists as a mostly unified whole, but which was created by multiple different people, over a long period of time.

[When Was ]{.calibre1}[[The Odyssey]{.italic}]{.calibre1}[ Composed?]{.calibre1}

The date of the poem, no less than its authorship, is a matter of serious disagreement. In the middle of the eighth century BCE, the inhabitants of Greece began to adopt a modified version of the Phoenician alphabet to write down their language. The Homeric poems may have been one of the earliest products of this new literacy. If so, they would have been composed some time in the late eighth century. But some scholars have suggested a significantly later date, in the early, middle, or late seventh century BCE; others, less plausibly, have suggested even later dates of composition. The near consensus is that, at some point between the late eighth and late seventh century, a hundred-year-long window, [The Odyssey]{.italic} was composed.

It is frustratingly difficult to be any more precise. Arguments about dating the Homeric poems usually involve an appeal to material evidence. Objects can often be dated with some precision, especially since the advent of carbon dating and other technological advances in archaeology. People use different artifacts as time goes by, or behave differently in ways that leave a material record: for instance, we know that people in the Mediterranean world switched from using bronze weapons to using, primarily, iron, once new metallurgical techniques developed. Ceramics survive well over thousands of years and are useful for tracking cultural change, since pottery fashions often change fairly rapidly. But it is extremely difficult to use any such evidence to date [The Odyssey]{.italic}. For example, inscribed on a clay drinking cup that was found on the Italian island of Ischia there is the fragment "Nestor's cup, good to drink from." Some scholars, citing an extensive description of King Nestor's magnificent golden cup in [The Iliad]{.italic}, have claimed that this inscription must be an allusion to the poem. It is nice to imagine that the words are a kind of joke: this simple, ordinary piece of crockery is identifying itself as a magnificent, heroic item. The cup can be dated to 750--700 BCE, so if this really is an allusion, [The Iliad]{.italic} cannot be later than that date. But it is also quite possible that there were other poems and traditions about Nestor; the cup does not actually quote [The Iliad]{.italic}, so it is not conclusive evidence that its maker knew the Homeric poem as such, rather than a set of associated Trojan legends---which we know also circulated in non-Homeric versions throughout the archaic period.

The Homeric poems reflect a mixture of artifacts and practices that existed at different historical times (such as divergent funeral practices, by burial or cremation, and different dowry practices). Indeed, the poems seem to have no interest in conveying an accurate, realistic account of the culture in which they were produced. Rather, they combine elements of a fictionalized, heroicized past with details of the more recent or contemporary world. Consider, as one example, the diets of characters in Homer. [The Odyssey]{.italic}'s noble classes subsist on bread and, especially, wine and meat---usually large, impressive domesticated animals like pigs, sheep, and cattle (not chickens or geese, although Penelope dreams of geese and geese are kept in the palace). Nobody ever drinks water, and the men eat fish only when the alternative is starvation---as when Odysseus and his men are stranded on the island of Thrinacia. In real life, as the archaeological record shows and as common sense would predict, the people who lived around the Mediterranean ate fish, vegetables, cheese, and fruit. It has been suggested that the diet of these heroes might reflect a vague memory of even more ancient Indo-European civilizations; the nomadic people of the steppes by the Black Sea ate far more meat than the Greeks ever did. But it seems most likely that Homeric elites do not eat meat as a reflection of reality, but because it is a way for the poem to demonstrate their distinguished and extraordinary status. Meat makes them strong, and it shows how strong and important they already are---the stuff of legends.

Questions of dating are further complicated by the fact that the Homeric poems, or sections of them, were performed regularly by rhapsodes for several hundred years. These "song-stitchers"---professional poetry performers---competed in public competitions, and imagined themselves as stitching together a quilt of poetic narrative out of an already existing cloth, one often presented as the poetry of "Homer." It seems likely that rhapsodes made use of written texts to learn their lines of Homer, although they may also have ad-libbed and riffed off the script. Rhapsodes presumably introduced variations on the texts in performance, until the first Homeric scholars, men associated with the library of ancient Alexandria in the second century BCE, tried to "correct" the texts. By this time there must have been many slight textual variants in the Homeric poems, and the Alexandrians tried to come up with the "best" reading at each moment when their manuscripts did not agree. We have evidence of the type of variant that existed in the texts of Homer in circulation in the classical period, because quotations of Homer by authors such as Plato are sometimes a little different from the text as we have it.

But [The Odyssey]{.italic} as read by Sophocles or Plato in fifth- or fourth-century Athens was presumably not significantly different from our own. Minor variations aside, the Homeric poems existed by the late seventh century BCE, and they quickly claimed a canonical place all over the Greek world. By the sixth century, they had acquired a central place in the cultural institutions of ancient Athens. In 566 BCE, Pisistratus, the tyrant of the city (which was not yet a democracy), instituted a civic and religious festival, the Panathenaia, which included a poetic competition, featuring performances of the Homeric poems. The institution is particularly significant because we are told that the Homeric poems had to be performed "correctly," which implies the canonization of a particular written text of [The Iliad]{.italic} and [The Odyssey]{.italic} at this date. From that time onward, if not before, [The Iliad]{.italic} and [Odyssey]{.italic} acquired a central place in the cultural and educational life of ancient Greece and Rome. There was no holy scripture in the classical world, but everyone knew the stories of Achilles and Odysseus as told in the Homeric poems.

[Homer's World]{.calibre1}

The geographical setting of [The Odyssey]{.italic} is almost as hard to pin down as its temporal location. Some of the places visited by Odysseus are obviously fictional or mythical---the Land of the Dead, the island of the Sirens, the home of the monster Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis, or the city of the giant, cannibalistic Laestrygonians. But even the places that seem less clearly unrealistic are often difficult to plot onto an accurate map. Ethiopia is the most distant place imaginable, located "between the sunset and the dawn." Libya is a mythically wealthy place where sheep produce lambs three times a year. Egypt is a little less hazy, but still not described with any precision: it is the fertile land of the Nile, where traders or visitors (like Menelaus) can acquire fabulous amounts of wealth. Even the island of Ithaca itself is described in a muddled way. This may be a sign that the traditions that informed the poem developed primarily in the eastern part of the Greek world, so that the composer(s) had only a vague notion of the actual geography of the western islands like Ithaca. It is also a sign that the poem has little interest in the realistic depiction of geography.

Nevertheless, readers since antiquity have tried to locate the wanderings of Odysseus in the real Mediterranean and Aegean world. By the third century BCE, certain traditional identifications of Homeric geography with real geography had developed. Scylla and Charybdis were identified with the Straits of Messina (where there are often rough currents, though never six-headed sea-monsters). Sicily was identified as the Island of the Cyclops---a rich, fertile land inhabited by non-Greek people, whose customs and agricultural practices are different from those of Greece.

These identifications reflect an awareness that there is some correspondence between the world of Homer and the real world, although the relationship is partial and inexact; see Map 1, which depicts the fictional wanderings of the hero, in contrast to Maps 2, 3, and 4, which depict the geographical realities on which the fantasy is loosely based. [The Odyssey]{.italic} explores the relationship of its central character, a man from the western Greek world, with people, gods, and monsters from many different regions, each of which has its own separate identity, and which correspond in wildly different degrees to real life.

"Greece," as a unified entity, is an invention of the classical age; in the sixth and especially the fifth centuries BCE, Greek-speaking people began to define themselves as Hellenes, in contrast to the "barbarian" (meaning "non-Greek-speaking") peoples of other civilizations, such as the Persians and the Egyptians. But in Homer, as Thucydides points out, there is no single term for all Greek people. Those who sail to attack Troy from places that would later be defined as "Greek" are categorized by names for smaller ethnic tribes, or as the followers of individual leaders: the Danaeans, the Achaeans, the Myrmidons, and so on.

[The Odyssey]{.italic} reflects an awareness of the many diverse peoples who inhabited the territories around mainland Greece. During the Bronze Age, in the fourth to second millennia BCE, the Minoans, who may have been proto-Greek speakers, inhabited Crete, while other proto-Greek speakers lived on the Cycladic islands of the Aegean, and others again on the mainland. These people left tantalizing glimpses of their cultures, through material remains, including wall paintings and pottery and ruined palaces and homes. In the sixteenth to twelfth centuries BCE, the so-called Mycenean Greeks established a powerful civilization on the Greek mainland, with grand palaces in locations such as Mycenae itself, but also in many other cities, including Pylos (home, in [The Odyssey]{.italic}, of old King Nestor). The Myceneans had a system of writing known as Linear B, a syllabic script that was used by scribes to make administrative records on clay tablets. But when Mycenean civilization fell---perhaps due to invasion by non-Greek people or, more likely, because of civil warfare and possibly climate change---the great palaces were destroyed and, with them, the Linear B writing system was lost.

In the Greek "dark ages," from the twelfth to the eighth centuries BCE, Greece was illiterate, and it was in this period that the oral poetic tradition that led into [The Odyssey]{.italic} developed. The stories and myths that circulated in this period reflected memories and fantasies about the lost cultures of the Minoans and the Myceneans---although they were also drawn from neighboring cultures, such as the civilizations of the ancient Near East (including Egypt, Iran, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor). The oral tradition provided Greek-speaking people with a way to remember and memorialize the cultures that had been lost, including the wealthy and hierarchical civilization of the Myceneans.

The legends of the Trojan War---tales of a great conflict, the fall of a mighty people, and the attempts of scattered survivors to regain or build new homes---are informed by folk memory of this fallen culture. [The Iliad]{.italic} tells the story of a conflict between two elite warrior kings, Agamemnon of Mycenae and Achilles of Thessaly---perhaps echoing a real collapse of Mycenean civilization through civil war. In [The Odyssey]{.italic}, the rich palaces of Nestor on Pylos and Menelaus in Sparta may reflect folk memories of Mycenean grandeur. Crete is another important point of reference in [The Odyssey.]{.italic} When Odysseus in Ithaca tells false tales about himself, he often says that he comes from Crete---which may echo archaic Minoan or Mycenean myths, and reflect a cultural memory of the days when Crete was at the center of Greek-speaking civilization.

It is hard to say how much the Homeric poems depict the realities of actual historical events, such as "the" Trojan War. In the late nineteenth century, an amateur archaeologist named Heinrich Schliemann excavated a site in Turkey, Hissarlik, that he theorized was the original Troy. He made some extraordinary discoveries, including a cache of gold that he labeled "Priam's treasure"; later, on a different excavation in Mycenae, he claimed to have uncovered the real tomb of Agamemnon. Modern archaeologists tend to be more skeptical, and to lament the way in which Schliemann---like other archaeologists of his time---rashly shoveled his way into the earth, destroying a vast amount of evidence in the process. Hissarlik is still identified as the site of Troy, but it is now generally believed that there were at least nine towns built in the area over the course of some three millennia, from early Bronze Age settlements to a Roman imperial city. Some of these cities were destroyed by natural means, such as earthquakes, and others were destroyed by fire and war; but we cannot identify any one of these multiple destructions with the single sacking of Troy described in Homer.

It was from the Phoenicians that, in the middle of the eighth century, Greece adapted their alphabetic system of writing. The Phoenicians, a trading, seafaring people who originated from the western part of the Fertile Crescent (in the area which now includes Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Israel, and Jordan), are portrayed in the poem as rich traders who are liable to trick, rob, and enslave the unwary. Odysseus tells his swineherd, Eumaeus, an elaborate false story that he came from Crete, stayed in Egypt for seven years getting rich, and then was tricked by a "cunning man" from Phoenicia into sailing with him; the Phoenician hoped to trade him as a slave, for a profit. Eumaeus replies with his own, presumably more truthful story, which again involves being tricked and trafficked into slavery---which explains how he has ended up in Odysseus' own household.

These sinister, deceitful, profit-mongering Phoenicians are ostensibly contrasted with Odysseus himself. Similarly, the seafaring people of Taphos are described as "pirates," who live by looting, robbing, and enslaving their neighbors---in contrast to the maritime wanderings of Odysseus, whose only goal is to reach his home. But the line is uncomfortably difficult to draw. Odysseus is depicted as a master of deceit, a compulsive liar; he is also, like a Phoenician or Taphian trader or pirate, hoping to return home with as large a pile of loot as he can. He enriches himself from the sacked city of Troy, and from various other places along the way, where the inhabitants either willingly equip him with presents (as in the case of Calypso, Circe, Aeolus, and the Phaeacians) or are robbed by Odysseus and his men. When telling the story of his various adventures to the Phaeacians, Odysseus begins with an episode in which he and his men stop by the city of the Cicones. He explains,

> > > > > [I sacked]{.italic}

> [the town and killed the men. We took their wives]{.italic}

> [and shared their riches equally among us.]{.italic}
> [ (9.41--43)]{.calibre4}

No justification is given for this act of plunder; it is presented simply as the kind of thing that Odysseus does, or perhaps the kind of thing that any Greek man would do, given the chance. A little later, Polyphemus the Cyclops asks Odysseus suspiciously if he is a "pirate," like people who "risk their lives at sea to bring disaster / to other people." Odysseus' answer is notably equivocal. He declares that he and his men are part of the great expedition to Troy, and claims

> [We are proud to be the men of Agamemnon,]{.italic}

> [the son of Atreus, whose fame is greatest]{.italic}

> [under the sky, for sacking that vast city]{.italic}

> [and killing many people.]{.italic}
> [ (9.263--66)]{.calibre4}

Being a "hero," [heros]{.italic}---which in archaic Greek suggests a warrior, and does not imply virtue---is different from being a "pirate" in that it is a much more positive term, which a man can proudly apply to himself; nobody in Homer admits to being a pirate. Like pirates, warriors sack towns and kill the inhabitants; the main difference is scale. Odysseus goes on to infiltrate the enemy's dwelling, maim him, and poach his beloved sheep, the wealth of his household---an act that is clearly analogous to the hero's previous triumph over the Trojans.

The late eighth century was a period of increasing trade across the Mediterranean world---including trade of objects, stories, skills (like writing), ideas, and people. It was also a period in which Greek speakers had begun to create colonies. Colonization was a way to improve trading opportunities and increase the wealth of the originating city or settlement, as well as to house a growing population. Greek colonies developed in Libya, in southern France, along the Black Sea, and on the southern coast of Italy and Sicily---later known as Magna Graecia, "Big Greece." [The Odyssey]{.italic} shows an acute awareness of the processes of colonization, and Odysseus himself seems sometimes to think as much like a colonizer as a pirate. When scoping out the uninhabited island adjacent to that of the Cyclopes, he gives a description that sounds like an advertisement for prospective colonial inhabitants, as well as a critique, from the colonizer's point of view, of the natives who have failed to exploit their country's natural resources:

> [Cyclopic people have no red-cheeked ships]{.italic}

> [and no shipwright among them who could build]{.italic}

> [boats, to enable them to row across]{.italic}

> [to other cities, as most people do,]{.italic}

> [crossing the sea to visit one another.]{.italic}

> [With boats they could have turned this island into]{.italic}

> [a fertile colony, with proper harvests.]{.italic}

> [By the gray shore there lie]{.italic}
> [well-watered meadows,]{.italic}

> [where vines would never fail. There is flat land]{.italic}

> [for plowing, and abundant crops would grow]{.italic}

> [in the autumn; there is richness underground]{.italic}. [ (9.125--35)]{.calibre4}

It is not surprising that the island was identified in antiquity with Sicily, given both the lush natural resources of this location in the poem, and the ways that the Polyphemus episode seems to meditate uneasily on the processes of colonization. In real life, we know frustratingly little about the process by which the Greeks established their control. The Greek invaders quickly imported their own agricultural products---olives for oil, and grapes for wine---and later used slaves, perhaps including native Sicilians, to construct monumental architecture, vast temples to the Greek gods to represent Hellenic dominance in the region. The various tribes who inhabited Sicily before the Greeks took over do not seem to have managed to fight back against the invaders, and there is no way to reconstruct what they felt about it all.

We can see in [The Odyssey]{.italic} a complex response by the Greeks to their own growing dominance as traders, travelers, colonizers, pirates, leaders, and warriors. The Polyphemus episode, for example, can be read as an attempt to justify Greek exploitation of non-Greek peoples. Odysseus enters the Cyclops' cave without the host's permission, and then tricks, blinds, robs, and abuses the native inhabitant. As narrator, he makes his actions seem acceptable or even admirable, by emphasizing morally irrelevant considerations---such as the fact that the Cyclops lives by herding animals rather than growing crops (as presumably was also true of the native Sicilians), and by presenting his victim as loud, ugly, and oversized. Of course, Polyphemus also has the nasty habit of eating his human visitors. By this means, the text invites us to imagine that all non-Greek and pastoralist societies should be seen as barbaric and cannibalistic.

The narrative is told only through the mouth of Odysseus himself, and we may well see him as an unreliable narrator. Odysseus implies that the Cyclopic people (also known as the "Cyclopes," plural of Cyclops) are "lawless," or lacking in customs; but Polyphemus does his chores in an entirely regular and predictable fashion. Odysseus implies that these people are loners who care nothing for one another; but Polyphemus' neighbors arrive promptly when they hear him calling for help, and the Cyclops treats his animals with attentive care and affection---his blind petting of his favorite "sweet ram" is particularly touching. Odysseus first tells us that the Cyclopes "put their trust in gods," who provide them with crops (implying that these people can be blamed for their lazy lack of Greek-style agricultural practices), but then suggests that a failure to welcome strangers should be construed as an insult to "the gods," or at least to Zeus, the god of strangers---suggesting that the gods are all on the Greek side. In fact, Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon, has some powerful divine backing of his own.

[The Odyssey]{.italic} looks back to a lost heroic age, the time before the Greek dark ages, when elite Mycenean families, living in great palaces, dominated the surrounded regions, clashed with one another, and maintained power through wealth, military prowess, and a traditional way of life. But the poem also meditates on the social and geographical changes undergone by Greek society in the late eighth century, as the new literacy enabled new forms of communication with outsiders, and as colonizers, traders, and pirates pushed outward across the Mediterranean, encountering alien cultures and alien peoples.

[Friends, Strangers, Guests]{.calibre1}

Before approaching the island of the Cyclopes, Odysseus tells his men that he has to find out some important information: whether the inhabitants are "lawless aggressors," or people who welcome strangers. Odysseus presents these categories as if they are mutually exclusive: the willingness to welcome strangers is figured as enough, in itself, to guarantee that a person or culture can be counted as law-abiding and "civilized." The Cyclopes would have good reason to be suspicious of these visitors, who have looted and slaughtered the inhabitants of the previous island that they visited. But the dichotomy hints at the importance in [The Odyssey]{.italic} of [xenia]{.italic}, a word that means both "hospitality" and "friendship." The cognate word [xenos]{.italic} can mean both "stranger" and "friend"; it is the root from which we get the English word "xenophobia," the fear of strangers or foreigners, as well as the sadly less common "xenophilia," the love of strangers or of unknown objects.

Hospitality is important in all human cultures, ancient and modern; in this respect, there is nothing special about archaic Greece. What is distinctive about the customs surrounding hospitality in this culture is that elite men who have entered one another's homes and have been entertained appropriately are understood to have created a bond of "guest-friendship" ([xenia]{.italic}) between their households that will continue into future generations. Guest-friendship is different from [philia]{.italic}, the friendship, affection, love, and loyalty that connects a person to his or her family members and neighborhood friends. It is created not by proximity and kinship, but by a set of behaviors that create bonds between people who are geographically distant from each other. [Xenia]{.italic} is thus a networking tool that allows for the expansion of Greek power, from the unit of the family to the city-state and then across the Mediterranean world. It is the means by which unrelated elite families can connect to one another as equals, without having to fight for dominance. It is no coincidence that the origin of the Trojan War, the abduction of Menelaus' wife by his guest, Paris, is presented in Greek literature as an abuse of [xenia,]{.italic} since the laws of hospitality are what stave off a world where men kill those who are different from themselves. When [xenia]{.italic} is absent or is abused, violence follows.

[Xenia]{.italic} acquired an extra importance in the era when Greek men were expanding their world. Travelers, in an era before money, hotels, or public transportation, had to rely on the munificence of strangers to find food and lodging and aid with their onward journey. [The Odyssey]{.italic} suggests that it was the responsibility of male householders to offer hospitality of this kind to any visitor, even uninvited guests, strangers, and homeless beggars. Those who traveled to an unfamiliar land used the norms and expectations of [xenia]{.italic} to form bonds with people who might otherwise have treated them as too ragged and dirty to deserve a welcome, or as too dangerous to accept into their home. Conversely, the promotion of Greek [xenia]{.italic} as a quasi-universal and quasi-ethical concept can be used as imaginative justification for robbing, killing, enslaving, or colonizing those who are reluctant to welcome a group of possible bandits or pirates into their home. [The Odyssey]{.italic} shows us both sides of this complex concept, which hovers in an uneasy space between ethics and etiquette.

The poem's episodes can be seen as a sequence of case studies in the concept of [xenia]{.italic}. In the first four books---known as the Telemachy, the story of Telemachus---Odysseus' young son grapples with the suitors, who are presented as bad guests: they have taken over Odysseus' household without his permission and are abusing its resources and inhabitants. By contrast, Telemachus shows that he himself is capable of being a good, polite guest who is more or less able to overcome his crippling shyness with the magical help of Athena. He thanks his hosts appropriately, and does not overstay his welcome. He manages to be a good host also, when he welcomes a stranger in need, Theoclymenus, on board his ship. He even manages to circumvent a tricky dilemma of etiquette---how to avoid having to make a second visit with touchy, long-winded Nestor, without being rude to the old man---although only at the cost of putting his friend, Nestor's son, in a difficult position.

Telemachus' visits to the homes of Nestor and Menelaus provide contrasting examples of elite hospitality. The first is old-fashioned, pious, rich in horses and sons, presided over by moralizing old Nestor. The second is piled high with newly acquired treasure, brought by blustering, self-pitying Menelaus, and the dominant figure is beautiful, magical Helen, who has frightening drugs that can take away all pain and grief. But in both Pylos and Sparta, the visit follows a set pattern. The guest is welcomed, washed by slave women, given an honorable and comfortable place to sit, and offered food and wine. Only after he has eaten and had some wine is he asked to tell his story. The visitor is then given lodging for the night, and when it is time to leave, the host provides gifts and some practical help with the onward journey. As Menelaus pompously declares, "To force a visitor to stay / is just as bad as pushing him to go." Providing help with the next leg of the trip---[pompe]{.italic} in Greek, "sending," a common word and essential concept in the [Odyssey]{.italic}---is thus an important component in hospitality. Nestor, for example, gives Telemachus a horse-drawn chariot to get to Sparta, and sends along his youngest son, Pisistratus, as a companion.

Odysseus is not so lucky in some of his hosts. We first see him suffering the burdens of a hospitality even more insistently lavish than that of Nestor. Calypso gives her human guest more than enough of everything a visitor could ask for, except the final crucial ingredient: [pompe]{.italic}---the ability to get away. When, thanks to divine intervention, Calypso finally lets Odysseus build a raft and be on his way---an unorthodox "sending" in which the guest has to construct his own means of transportation---his next hosts are challenging in different ways. The shipwrecked, naked stranger finds himself rescued by a young princess of marriageable age, among a nation of sailors, and has to muster all his powers of flattery and politeness. Nausicaa, the Phaeacian princess, warns Odysseus that her people are not welcoming to strangers; yet the court of Arete and Alcinous seems in many ways ideally hospitable. Odysseus is bathed, wined and dined, entertained with poetic song, and given the chance to tell his own story at great length. He watches and then is put to the test in the Phaeacian contests, performing far better than expected---an episode that anticipates the later challenges and contests back home in Ithaca. The Phaeacians then give him the most lavish possible [pompe]{.italic}---a magical boat that sails itself---at a high personal cost to themselves; Poseidon punishes them by crushing their boat with a mountain hurled into the sea, thus blocking their island from the outside world forever after and curtailing any future Phaeacian generosity.

The limits and antonyms of [xenia]{.italic} are explored in Odysseus' account to the Phaeacian king of his wanderings to other fantastical, monstrous places he has visited. Each of these hosts seems to offer a perversion or a frightening exaggeration of the ordinary modes of hospitality. Aeolus, the god of the winds, provides Odysseus with a means of transportation or "sending" that is more powerful than he or his men can handle: the bag of winds, once opened, blasts the ship back in entirely the wrong direction. A normal host may provide his guests with poetic and musical entertainment before he goes to sleep; the Sirens entice their visitors with a song so fascinating that they want to stay forever, and never go home again. Many of these hosts pervert the ordinary way that guests are given food and drink. The Lotus-Eaters share a plant that makes those who eat it forget all thoughts of going home. In order to meet the dead, Odysseus himself has to act like a peculiar kind of host, welcoming them into the world of the living---by allowing them to drink blood from a ditch. The witchlike goddess Circe provides her guests with a magical drink that turns them into pigs.

Several of those whom Odysseus visits---the giant Polyphemus, the gigantic Laestrygonians, the thirsty whirlpool Charybdis, and the six-headed Scylla---are defined as monstrous because they do not feed their guests: instead, they eat them (or, in the case of Charybdis, gulp them down like drink). The majority of Odysseus' men are devoured alive. Some are eaten by the Cyclops; many more are skewered in the water by the Laestrygonians and devoured, like fish. Later, Odysseus watches Scylla eating six of his men and hears them "still screaming, / still reaching out to me in their death throes."

After this climactic moment, the ship---the last left from Odysseus' fleet---sails directly on to Thrinacia, the island of the Sun God (Helius), and is becalmed there. Supplies dwindle and the men grow hungry. While Odysseus is absent, taking a nap in a cave, the men kill and eat the Cattle of the Sun, although they know that it is forbidden. This momentous choice is made for understandable reasons: the men are hungry and desperate, and they choose to risk the anger of the gods rather than endure the pain and slow humiliation of death by starvation. The ringleader of the insurrection, Eurylochus, speaks bravely, urging the others not to worry about the Sun God's response:

> > > > ["If he is so angry]{.italic}

> [about these cows that he decides to wreck]{.italic}

> [our ship, and if the other gods agree---]{.italic}

> [I would prefer to drink the sea and die]{.italic}

> [at once, than perish slowly, shriveled up]{.italic}

> [here on this desert island."]{.italic}
> [ (12.347--52)]{.calibre4}

The language is inspiring, as if from a rousing battle speech. We may well wonder what exactly is wrong with Eurylochus' suggestion. The episode hints at an important idea in the poem: that the willingness to die for honor, which is valued so highly on the battlefield, is not always useful in these strange new worlds. Military valor, in the world of [The Odyssey,]{.italic} risks looking too much like impatience[.]{.italic} The poem shows us the rewards that come to the "much-enduring" or "long-suffering" protagonist through his willingness to wait for the right moment to act, without ever giving up the goal. Moreover, the determination of this crew member to eat even forbidden foods, and to drink even "the sea," represents a kind of self-assertion that is out of keeping with his place both in society and in the narrative. He is usurping the leadership role of Odysseus.

This act of forbidden consumption is a terrible mistake, which condemns the men to death and deprives them of their chance of getting home. Helius, the Sun God, responds to the eating of his cattle as if the men had taken a bite out of the god himself, and Zeus backs him up by drowning them all. Eating is important in [The Odyssey,]{.italic} and eating the wrong things or eating in the wrong way results in violence or death.

Like the Cyclops or the Laestrygonians, the suitors who have taken over Odysseus' palace in Ithaca are defined as abnormal and monstrous eaters. We are repeatedly told that they are "devouring" and "wasting" the household wealth of Odysseus, by consuming his fattest animals and drinking his wine in their constant feasts, and failing to repay the absent owner or take care of the estate. It is, of course, a violation of hospitality to enter a person's home uninvited and remain there day after day, using up his food stores, wine, and wealth. The poem emphasizes that it is also unjust: the norms of behavior require a person to pay back what he or she owes, and a guest is supposed to give presents to a generous host, rather than simply enjoy the benefits of hospitality without giving anything in return.

Greed, ingratitude, and rudeness are annoying but, one might think, rather trivial faults. These boorish, selfish, immature young men are certainly unpleasant to be around, but not necessarily the epitome of evil, and it may be difficult to understand how anybody could think they really deserve death. The poem itself invites us to feel a degree of horror at Odysseus' violence, and sympathy for the murdered boys. On the other hand, the language in which [The Odyssey]{.italic} presents the suitors' eating and drinking magnifies the enormity of their crime. The standard epithets applied to the suitors often emphasize their excessive desire to be "above" or "beyond" others ([hyper]{.italic}: above and beyond): they are [hyper-phialos]{.italic} or [hyper-thymos]{.italic} ("self-indulgent," "heedless," "overbearing"). These words can be neutral or even positive (suggesting "noble" or "high-minded"---above the norms in a good way), but they acquire a sinister connotation here, since they are also applied to the man-eating Laestrygonians and Cyclops. We are repeatedly told that the suitors are devouring not only the literal "property" of Odysseus, but also, metonymically, his "house" and hence his "livelihood" or "life"---the words [bios]{.italic} and [biotos]{.italic} can mean both "way of making a living" and "life" itself. It is as if in eating Odysseus' animals, the suitors are metaphorically eating the man himself, and his son. Telemachus complains that the suitors are "consuming my whole house, and soon they may / destroy me too." The rage Odysseus musters against his uninvited guests seems to stem from a desperate need to preserve not only his wealth but even his identity from the mouths of those who are eating him alive.

But people who feel oppressed can become more dangerous than the people they fear. Once he reaches Ithaca, Odysseus is in the position of a guest in his own home, disguised as an old beggar. He is given a modest but warm welcome by the slave pig-keeper, Eumaeus, while the suitors act as unfriendly, hostile hosts, mocking and throwing stools at their ragged guest. However, when Odysseus is restored to his own persona, taking charge again of his household, the roles of guest and host make a sudden switch. The poor old visitor is now the householder himself. Odysseus becomes one of the most terrifying hosts of all, defending his property against unwanted visitors as thoroughly and violently as the Laestrygonians or the Sun God himself.

[Gods]{.calibre1}

[Xenia]{.italic} is particularly important to the gods in general, and especially to Zeus, the father and king of all the gods. One of the standard titles of Zeus was Xenios ("God of Strangers"). He is the god who presides over visitors, foreigners, and beggars, and who is invoked to defend the rights of guests or of hosts, when people fail to adhere to the norms of [xenia]{.italic}. Zeus is also the god associated most closely with justice---[dike]{.italic} in Greek, a notion linked to the idea of balance, and hence to the idea of retribution. Some readers have assumed that the gods in this poem---or at least Zeus---are defenders not only of [xenia]{.italic} (which is, as we have seen, only partly an ethical concept), but also of morality in general. Some leap to the further notion that the triumph of Odysseus over the suitors represents an ethical victory, sanctioned by the gods. This certainly goes too far. Odysseus is presented as a morally complex character, as ancient readers recognized. The gods in [The Odyssey]{.italic}, like those of [The Iliad,]{.italic} are self-interested beings, whose interventions in human lives are motivated primarily by their own desires, whims, and preferences rather than by a consistent commitment to uphold moral law.

The main difference between gods and humans is that gods are far more powerful and, unlike mortals, immune from old age and death. Humans in the poem, especially Telemachus and Odysseus himself, invoke the gods as guardians of what is "right," but it is less clear that the gods see themselves in quite this way.

At the start of [The Odyssey]{.italic}, Zeus is contemplating a problem in the human world. Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, had raised troops to help his brother Menelaus reclaim his wife, Helen, who had been taken to Troy by Paris, son of Priam, king of Troy. But in Agamemnon's absence, Aegisthus, who had an alternative claim to the throne of Mycenae, seduced Agamemnon's wife, Clytemnestra, seized control of his kingdom, and murdered Agamemnon when he came back home from Troy. Later, Agamemnon's young son Orestes---who had been sent away for his own protection---returned to Mycenae and killed both Aegisthus and his own mother, Clytemnestra, in revenge for the killing of his father.

Zeus presents the story of Aegisthus as an object lesson in human folly. People are already destined to suffer a certain amount, and yet sometimes they increase their quota of suffering by making bad choices---as Aegisthus did in killing Agamemnon and partnering with Clytemnestra, despite the warnings of the gods. Athena replies by reminding her father that Odysseus is stuck on Calypso's island, thanks to "bad luck," the hostility of Poseidon, and the negligence of Zeus himself---although perhaps also, we may speculate, thanks to his own decisions.

This first exchange between divine father and divine daughter has sometimes been read to imply that the gods of [The Odyssey]{.italic} ensure that good people, like Odysseus, are rewarded for their virtue, while bad people, like the suitors, are punished. Aristotle, the philosopher of the fourth century BCE, may hint at this interpretation in a very brief allusion to the poem: he says that [The Odyssey]{.italic} has a double structure, and ends in opposite ways for the "better" and "worse" characters ([Poetics]{.italic} 1453a). But "better" is not the same as "good," and the word Aristotle uses can mean simply "more noble" or "higher class." In fact, neither Zeus' words nor the narrative of the poem suggests that morally good behavior guarantees a happy life. Zeus says nothing about virtue as such in this speech. Although one may speculate that the gods warned Aegisthus because they are on the side of ethical behavior (against adultery, murder, and usurpation), this is not what Zeus himself says. Rather, he insists that Aegisthus was imprudent and foolish in pursuing a course of action that he should have known would result in his doom. When Athena urges Zeus to help Odysseus, she does not claim that her favorite human is morally superior to all others---a case that would be hard to make about this lying, self-interested sacker of cities. Instead Athena reminds Zeus that Odysseus "is more sensible than other humans." His intelligence sets him apart from other adulterers and murderers. Gods usually favor people who are exceptionally talented in some way, and the poem makes it clear that it is Odysseus' special form of cleverness that has earned him the attention of Athena.

Moreover, Odysseus has made the prudent habit of regular sacrifice to the gods. The gods in this poem, like the human characters, prefer people who show them respect and provide plenty of lavish gifts. Gods in Homer, like humans, care about eating and drinking, and associate the proper forms of consumption with honor and identity. The consumption of meat and wine demonstrates the heroes' close relationship to the gods, since these, unlike other foodstuffs, are always offered to the gods: a splash of wine from any drinking occasion is always poured for the gods (as a libation), and animals that are killed are always "sacrificed," never merely butchered. The gods are the most important guests who are always present at human feasts.

Gods have their own particular interests. As father and king of the gods, Zeus takes a special interest in masculine political power. Chieftains in Homer, whether or not they descend from Zeus in terms of lineage, are often given the epithet [diotrephes,]{.italic} "sprung from Zeus"; in [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey,]{.italic} this epithet is applied exclusively to Odysseus himself, whose role as king of Ithaca is apparently important to Zeus. Zeus is associated with the eagle, the king of the birds, and at more than one key moment in the poem (including the omen in Book 3, and the dream in Book 18), eagles represent Odysseus himself as the king whose power as king, and capacity to exact retribution on his enemies, seem to be favored by Zeus. In Book 1, Telemachus' attempt to speak out against the suitors is valorized by Zeus, who sends two eagles to swoop into the assembled crowd:

> [they wheeled and whirred and flapped their mighty wings,]{.italic}

> [swooping at each man's head with eyes like death.]{.italic}
> [ (2.152--53)]{.calibre4}

The birds anticipate the moment, twenty-two books later, when Telemachus and Odysseus together will slaughter the suitors. The day before the massacre, in a memorably creepy episode, the prophet Theoclymenus is able to foresee the suitors' deaths, when they lose control of their own faces, and their cooked meat begins to drip with blood; the prophet declares,

> ["Your faces, heads and bodies are wrapped up]{.italic}

> [in night; your screams are blazing out like fire.]{.italic}

> [The ornate palace ceilings and the walls]{.italic}

> [are spattered with your blood. The porch is full]{.italic}

> [of ghosts, as is the]{.italic}
> [courtyard---ghosts descending]{.italic}

> [into the dark of Erebus. The sun]{.italic}

> [has vanished from the sky, and gloomy mist]{.italic}

> [is all around."]{.italic}
> [ (20.353--60)]{.calibre4}

Even before their deaths at the human hands of Odysseus and his helpers, the suitors are doomed by a divinely ordained fate.

But there is more than one god in this poem, and more than one point of view from which to look at Odysseus. The god most hostile to the hero is Zeus' brother Poseidon, the god of the sea, storms, and earthquakes. Indeed, the narrative of the poem can be seen as an extended balancing act between Athena's desire to restore Odysseus to a place of honor and stability in his household, and Poseidon's to curse him with eternal wandering. Poseidon is understandably angry that Odysseus tricks and blinds his son, Polyphemus the Cyclops, who in Book 9 calls on his father to curse the homeward journey of the man who maimed him. Poseidon is less prominent as a character in the poem than his rival, Athena; he gets far fewer speeches and far fewer appearances interacting with the human characters. But we can see his work behind every storm and shipwreck, and behind every disaster that befalls Odysseus' unlucky fellow travelers.

Homer presents us with a world where gods mingle with humans, and may touch their lives in ways that are not always visible to the mortals involved. Great charm and magic comes from the notion that the divine and human worlds are less separate than we might otherwise imagine. Telemachus, for example, is guided by Athena on his journey, and the presence of the goddess imparts a special comfort and joy even to the most mundane moments of the trip.

> [Wind blew the middle sail; the purple wave]{.italic}

> [was splashing loudly round the moving keel.]{.italic}

> [The goddess surfed the waves and smoothed the way.]{.italic}

> [The quick black ship held steady, so they fastened]{.italic}

> [the tackle down, and filled their cups with wine.]{.italic}

> [They poured libations to the deathless gods,]{.italic}

> [especially to the bright-eyed child of Zeus.]{.italic}

> [All through the night till dawn the ship sailed on.]{.italic}
> [ (2.427--34)]{.calibre4}

Mortal characters, and their accessories, are very frequently referred to by the standard approbatory epithet, "godlike" (or variations thereof), and one of the most common epithets of all, [dios]{.italic}---often translated as "noble" or "shining"---literally suggests "associated with Zeus" (the word has the same root as the Latin [deus]{.italic}, "god"). The sixth-century BCE philosopher Thales said, "The world is full of gods." This is certainly true of the world of Odysseus. On his travels, he meets a number of minor deities, including the "nymph" Calypso. "Nymph" is the normal Greek word for a human young bride, but it is also applied to goddesses who are particularly closely associated with the natural landscape in particular places; there are nymphs of the sea (Nereids), nymphs of the woods (Dryads), and nymphs of caves (like Calypso herself, whose name suggests "hidden," and like the unnamed nymphs whom Odysseus greets as soon as he arrives back in Ithaca). Every place has its own special deity---some welcoming or helpful, like the White Goddess who rescues Odysseus from shipwreck, and some hostile, like Scylla and Charybdis---goddesses who emerge from the dangerous natural world.

A particularly important god in this poem about journeys and interactions between people from different cultures and different households is Hermes, the messenger god, the god of travelers. Hermes is a son of Zeus who has the ability to fly at supernatural speed, bringing news or passengers from one realm to another, wearing the magical sandals "of everlasting gold with which he flies / on breath of air across the sea and land." Hermes can dive from sky to earth and down to the underworld, and can flash through water to travel across the sea:

> [He touched Pieria, then from the sky]{.italic}

> [he plunged into the sea and swooped between]{.italic}

> [the waves, just like a seagull catching fish,]{.italic}

> [wetting its whirring wings in tireless brine]{.italic}
> [ (5.50--53)]{.calibre4}

Hermes has a certain elusive quality, appearing and disappearing at will; he is, like Odysseus himself, a trickster. In the (post-Odyssean) "Homeric Hymn to Hermes," this clever, deceitful thief acquires an epithet often used of Odysseus himself---[polytropos]{.italic}, "much-turning." Hermes plays a key role at three important junctures. He is the one who is sent down unwillingly from Olympus, to the distant island of Calypso, to persuade the goddess to release Odysseus; he saves Odysseus and his men from Circe; and in the final book, he is the one who leads the spirits of the suitors to the underworld.

The most important deity in the poem, however, is Athena, the goddess of technical expertise and strategic thinking. She is a military deity, often represented as dressed in battle armor, and she reminds Odysseus that she is the one who helped him sack the city of Troy, inspiring the construction of the Wooden Horse. Athena also presides over activities associated more with peacetime; Penelope's weaving, no less than Odysseus' fighting, is done under the aegis of Athena. Whereas Poseidon favors the untamed world of the stormy sea, Athena loves fixed settlements and the olive tree---a crop whose oil was used in archaic Greece for cooking and skin care. Poseidon makes the earth shake; Athena makes even the most rugged, barren landscape available for cultivation.

Athena's most common epithet, [glaucopis,]{.italic} suggests bright or shimmering eyes. The poem constantly reminds us that Athena is alert to whatever is happening to Odysseus and Telemachus; nothing escapes her intelligent, careful notice. We can detect her presence in the narrative, her sharp eyes, even at moments when she is not visible to the human characters. For instance, when Odysseus and his men put out the eye of the Cyclops, they do so with a staff made of olive wood. When Odysseus meets Athena in person on Ithaca, she tells him that she has always been watching over him and helping him, even during the terrible storms at sea when Odysseus thought that she was giving him no protection: "I am Athena, child of Zeus. I always / stand near you and take care of you, in all / your hardships," she declares.

Athena's ultimate motives are mixed and not always benevolent, as befits a divine being in the Greek imagination. She presents herself as consistently the defender of Odysseus and his male line. However, we are also reminded (in Book 5) that the storms which scattered the Greek fleet after the sack of Troy were caused by Athena herself, working alongside Poseidon, since she was enraged at how the Greeks defiled the Trojan temples---and she wanted to increase the glory of her favorite when, after long delays, he finally returns to slaughter the suitors. When Odysseus is in disguise in Ithaca, Athena goads him to greater and greater rage, and prompts the suitors to mistreat him. Athena loves violence, and knows how to manipulate events so as to maximize her own pleasure in battle. Her skill in weaving clothing for domestic use sits uneasily with her ability to weave deception and military strategy for the tapestry of war.

The major Olympian gods do not usually appear in their own true form to mortals. Athena appears in multiple different guises to Telemachus and Odysseus. She can be a bird of prey, not an eagle (the bird of her father Zeus) or a hawk (bird of Apollo), but a European vulture (an ossifrage) or an owl. The cult of Athena in Greece may have originated from that of a Minoan owl goddess. When disguised as a human, Athena appears as Odysseus' old guest-friend, Mentor. But she also assumes other guises. In Phaeacia, she is a little girl, carrying water from the well. When she has her most extensive conversation with Odysseus, in Book 13, she appears first as a well-dressed young man; then, as if to make herself recognizable to him, she transforms herself again, this time into a beautiful woman. Athena transforms Odysseus as well as herself. She can change him into a ragged old man, and then into a tall, handsome, strong man in the prime of life. Athena can mask places, too: she casts a magical mist to make Ithaca unrecognizable, even to Odysseus himself.

Athena's powers of transformation and disguise are part of her cunning, the quality she shares with Odysseus. In myth, Athena's mother is Metis, a goddess who is the personification of Odysseus' central quality: [metis]{.italic}, which means "cunning," "skill," "scheming," or "purpose." It is the kind of cleverness that enables one to prepare for any new challenge and to come out as a winner. Metis was supposedly swallowed up by Zeus, and Athena emerged whole from the head of her father---a myth that hints at how the archaic Greeks imagined this potentially dangerous and unattractive quality as one that could become acceptable, even admirable, in the right contexts. Unlike the English word "wisdom," which tends to suggest a staid, peaceful, possibly moral kind of intelligence acquired by long years of experience, [metis]{.italic} suggests cunning plots and deception employed in the service of self-interest. It is not necessarily seen as a bad thing; [metis]{.italic} is a very useful quality for a person who hopes to survive in a dangerous environment.

Odysseus is often described as [polymetis]{.italic}, a term that suggests an abundance of [metis]{.italic}. When the man and the goddess meet face-to-face in Book 13, they agree that they share a capacity for scheming, for deceit, for transformation, and for telling elaborate lies, as well as an ability to wait a surprisingly long time to achieve their ends. Athena tells him,

> > ["No man can plan and talk like you,]{.italic}

> [and I am known among the gods for insight]{.italic}

> [and craftiness."]{.italic}
> [ (13.298--300)]{.calibre4}

These shared characteristics explain why the man and the goddess get along so well together. The relationship between Athena and Odysseus has a flirtatious quality that is made all the more interesting by the fact that they come from different worlds---she a goddess, he a mortal---and by the fact that she is a mostly female character who has the absolute upper hand, as well as the power of life, death, and identity, over this dominant Greek male. The relationships of Odysseus with Calypso, Circe, and especially Athena give us glimpses of an alternative to the "normal" mortal world, in which female characters are always less powerful than their male partners.

[Goddesses, Wives, Princesses, and Slave Girls]{.calibre1}

We know frustratingly little about the lives of women in archaic Greece. The Homeric poems themselves are rich sources of information about Mediterranean society in the eighth century BCE, although both are highly artificial literary texts, and both were presumably created primarily by and for men. We see in [The Iliad]{.italic} a world in which women were often treated by elite warrior men as if they were objects, prizes traded in war for men's honor, along with other possessions, like bronze tripods and piles of treasure. But women also had their own distinctive work (as mothers, wives, weavers, and caretakers), and their own perspective on the male-dominated world of war. They fed, washed, and clothed the men who left them to fight among themselves for honor, and they washed, wrapped, and wept for the dead bodies that returned. They gave birth and cared for their children, and cried when men hurled them from the city walls. Fathers traded their daughters to other men as wives, and they were passed on to yet more men as trafficked slaves.

But perhaps life for women in archaic Greece was not always as bleak as this. [The Odyssey]{.italic} allows us to imagine a far more varied array of possible female lives. Its various settings---in multiple different islands, homes, and palaces, in peacetime rather than war---are mostly places where women or goddesses have a defined position and a voice. Some scholars have tried to find buried memories in [The Odyssey]{.italic} of an ancient, pre-Greek matriarchal society---for example, in the peculiarly high status of Queen Arete in Phaeacia, who sometimes, confusingly, seems more important than her husband, or in Penelope's power in Ithaca over even the male members of her household, most prominently Telemachus. But these elements in the poem probably tell us more about male fears and fantasies, both ancient and modern, than about the historical realities of archaic or pre-archaic women's lives.

Samuel Butler famously suggested in the nineteenth century that the [Odyssey]{.italic} must have been written by a woman, because it has so many interesting and sympathetically portrayed female characters: "People always write by preference of what they know best, and they know best what they most are, and have most to do with." Few modern scholars would agree: we have, sadly, no evidence for women participating in the archaic Greek epic tradition as composers or rhapsodes. Moreover, Butler's claim relied on the dubious assumptions that only a woman would want to write about female characters in any depth, and that all the elements he regarded as ham-fisted could be explained by positing a young, unmarried girl as the "authoress"---in contrast to [The]{.italic}
[Iliad,]{.italic} which was clearly the work of an adult man, a person capable of writing convincing battle scenes.

It is more plausible to view [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic} as the product of archaic male imaginations, questioning and defending the inequalities of male dominance within the status quo. The poem meditates on what women might be capable of, and the degree to which their potential can or should be suppressed. We are shown differences in how men and women behave---for instance, women in Homer do not fight, attack, or kill one another, or travel to foreign countries for trade or war. There are also similarities: both men and women speak, sing, cry, steal, think, plan, deceive, celebrate, organize, give orders, and feel a whole range of emotions---grief, surprise, frustration, rage, embarrassment, shame, loneliness, and joy.

[The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic} is a poem in which certain females have far more power than real women ever did in the society of archaic Greece. Most obviously, the goddess Athena, born from the head of her father, guides Odysseus through all his wanderings and all his plots, schemes, disguises, and battles back in Ithaca. Only through female divine power can his patriarchal dominance over his household be regained. On a human level, it is essential for the plot that Penelope has the power to choose in her husband's absence to marry one of her suitors, and that if she does so, the suitors will either divide the wealth of the house, or the new bridegroom will take control of the whole palace. It never seems to have been a normal Greek custom for power over the household to transfer through the woman to a new husband. But the notion is vitally important in [The Odyssey]{.italic}: if Penelope remarries, Odysseus will lose not only a person he loves, but also, perhaps more important, all his economic wealth and social status. It is at least hinted as a possibility that the wife in this poem, unlike most wives in real archaic society, has the power to choose the man who will have control over her household.

In many respects, the text reflects social roles that presumably existed in real life. Girls and women in [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic} occupy different social spheres from those of men and boys, and their particular types of expertise are different. Female slaves (like Eurycleia) take care of children inside the house and perform domestic labor, like making the beds and lighting the torches, while some male slaves (like the old swineherd Eumaeus) take care of animals and others (like Dolius and his sons) do farmwork and gardening. The task of feeding and clothing the elite is also divided along gender lines. Women slaves grind the grain, bake the bread, and set and clear the tables, while male slaves prepare and serve the meat and pour the wine. Women slaves (like Eurycleia and Eurynome) are the ones who wash, scrub, and anoint the bodies of male guests, and female slaves help elite women make the household clothes and linens, by spinning and weaving cloth, and help them take care of the clothes by doing laundry. Girls make the daily trip to fetch water for the household. Carpenters, shipbuilders, construction workers, ironmongers, priests, fishermen, hunters, pirates, tradesmen, and poets are male.

Among the elite, too, there are clear distinctions between male and female kinds of activity. Powerful men participate in male-only council meetings, and they are the ones who lead troops to war or (what is presented as much the same thing) on raids to kill and rob from neighboring settlements. Elite men are the primary participants in athletic competitions, although we glimpse girls playing ball in their spare time. Men predominate at feasts and banquets, although exceptional noblewomen (such as Helen, and Arete, queen of Phaeacia) are present. Elite women have a separate suite in the house, a set of "upper" or "inmost" rooms, such that Penelope is able to withdraw from the rowdy bustle of the suitors to her own tearstained bed.

The poem circles around the question of whether an elite woman's worth depends entirely on sexual fidelity. Odysseus has affairs with Calypso and Circe in the course of his wanderings, as well as a carefully calibrated flirtation with young Nausicaa. These episodes are not presented as a sign of disloyalty to his wife or a blot on his character---although it is notable that he is rather selective in his final account of these adventures when he tells Penelope about his journey. By contrast, the poem presents it as a matter of the utmost importance that Penelope must keep her suitors at bay and wait indefinitely for her absent husband. Female fidelity is important for maintaining a husband's sense of honor and control; it is associated with the preservation of a particular wealthy household and the perpetuation of a particular elite family line. The double standard creates a particular kind of vulnerability for both men and women within the system.

But the story of the affair between the god Ares and the goddess Aphrodite, told by the poet Demodocus in Book 8, reminds us that female fidelity may be important only in specific human social environments. Hephaestus, Aphrodite's husband, is furious about the affair, traps the lovers in bed, and wants to punish Ares; but the other male gods (with the important exception of Poseidon) treat the whole thing as an amusing joke. The divine lovers, male and female, skip away unharmed, with apparently no damage done to their reputation or status. Odysseus, whose greatest fear is that Penelope will act like Aphrodite, reacts oddly to this narrative: he is delighted. Perhaps there is a kind of relief in imagining a situation so different from his own---a world in which an adulterous affair does not result in loss of status, loss of wealth, and loss of life.

The most insistent declarations that women's value depends entirely on their loyalty to their husbands comes in the mouth of the murdered Agamemnon, who has good reason to be upset about adulterous wives; his wife's sexual infidelity represents the takeover of his household by Aegisthus. Odysseus meets the ghost of Agamemnon in Book 11 and is given a stern warning to keep a close watch on Penelope---lest she act as Agamemnon's wife, Clytemnestra, did, murdering him when he comes home and allowing the suitors to take control of Ithaca. Later, in Book 24, the spirit of Agamemnon meets the spirits of the murdered suitors, learns their story, and responds by exclaiming how lucky Odysseus was to have such a faithful, intelligent wife, whose fame should be made the subject of a divine poem---perhaps a poem like [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic} itself, but one that would allow a more prominent role for "intelligent Penelope."

The story of Aegisthus, Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, and Orestes recurs repeatedly in [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic} as the shadowy parallel to the story of the suitors, Odysseus, Penelope, and Telemachus. This parallel homecoming serves as a dark warning of what could have happened to Odysseus if he had arrived home openly, as Agamemnon did, rather than in disguise. The story of Agamemnon's death invites us to read Odysseus' slaughter of the suitors in terms of preemptive self-defense, as if he had to kill them in order to avoid being killed in turn. It is also presented as an important lesson for Telemachus. Without a son mature and determined enough to kill Aegisthus, Agamemnon's murder would have been left unavenged. Telemachus' growth to maturity seems in some ways to threaten Odysseus' position in the household: there would be less need for the father to return and regain control, if the son were already adult enough to manage everything and keep his mother's suitors at bay. Conversely, the example of Orestes presents a case where the son's maturity unambiguously benefits his father, albeit only after the father's death.

In some versions of the Agamemnon story, Clytemnestra actually kills her husband, with Aegisthus merely the accessory to the crime. This is the version used by Aeschylus in his later tragedy, the [Agamemnon]{.italic}; but it was likely that this version of the myth was already known at the time of the composition of [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic}. Why, then, is Clytemnestra's role consistently minimized in the references to the story here? A possible reason is that presenting Clytemnestra as eager to sleep with her suitor and murder her husband would cast a disturbing light on Odysseus' own wife, Penelope. The Agamemnon story is thus not simply contrasted with the Odysseus story, but also made parallel to it: in both cases, the wife is a decent person whose loyalty is tested when her husband is away at war. But the shadowy presence of the Agamemnon story may also underline our awareness that Penelope may not be able to wait forever for her absent husband. Moreover, in other early versions of the myth (as in Aeschylus), Orestes kills not only Aegisthus but also his own mother, Clytemnestra. In [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic}, we are told only that Orestes killed Aegisthus; the matricide is carefully erased from the story. But the uneasy relationship between Penelope and Telemachus clearly shows us that the interests of mothers and sons need not coincide. This parallel story acts as a reminder of the importance of Penelope's loyalty, and also reminds us that a sensible wife whose husband is long gone might have to move on.

The idea that male power depends on female sexual fidelity is also central to the myth of Clytemnestra's sister, Helen, whose abduction by Paris led to the Trojan War. In [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic}, we meet the beautiful and frighteningly intelligent Helen back home in Sparta, with her wealthy, blustering, and rather less intelligent husband, Menelaus. The affair between Helen and Paris, like the affair of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra, can be seen as another alternative but parallel narrative, showing what might happen if Penelope decided to go off with one of the suitors. But this counternarrative complicates the idea that it would be a disaster if Penelope had an affair, since Helen and Menelaus seem to have suffered no obvious ill effects from her escapade---beyond the fact that so many people decided to engage in the war and died as a result. The marriage seems, if anything, cemented by a shared sense of regret and a shared interest in the wonderful consumer goods they have acquired through their foreign conquests. At the moment when Penelope and Odysseus are reunited, Penelope speaks of Helen, and draws a complex, confusing comparison between her own situation---vulnerable to any deceitful stranger who may show up---and that of Helen, who left her husband for Paris. Penelope seems to suggest that Helen was forced into adultery (because Aphrodite compelled her and Paris tricked her), and also that, insofar as she made a choice, it was informed, as perhaps most choices are, by limited knowledge of the outcome. She could not know that "the Greeks would march to war / and bring her home again."

Should war, defined in [The]{.italic}
[Iliad]{.italic} as "the work of men," be seen as ultimately the fault of a woman---because Helen inspired Paris to abduct her? The question is left largely unanswered in Homer. In [The]{.italic}
[Iliad,]{.italic} Helen tells Priam she wishes she had "chosen death" rather than leave her husband for Paris---suggesting that she did have some kind of choice, but also that her only alternative was suicide. The affair is not presented as something that she actually desired. In [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey,]{.italic} a much more self-possessed and cheerful Helen declares that the Greeks made war "for the sake of" her face---a formulation that suggests that the woman's appearance is the men's supposed motive, but does not imply that it, let alone its owner, can be blamed for their actions.

Helen describes her face, the face that, in Christopher Marlowe's famous words, "launched a thousand ships," not as beautiful but as "doglike"; it is a face that (in this translation) "hounded" the Greeks to war. The idea that women or goddesses, especially desirable ones who sleep with men outside marriage, are like dogs, or have doglike faces, recurs at several moments in the poem: Hephaestus uses the same term of his unfaithful, divinely beautiful wife, Aphrodite; the dead Agamemnon calls his murderous wife a "she-dog"; and the pretty slave girl Melantho is called a "dog" by both Penelope and Odysseus. As a term of insult, "dog" is applied not only to women. Odysseus also calls the suitors "dogs" when he inveighs against their greedy, shameless consumption of his food supplies, and he suggests that the human belly is also always like a whining dog: it begs for food, even in circumstances where it is not appropriate or possible to eat. The night before the slaughter of the suitors, Odysseus feels his heart "bark" inside him, like a "mother dog" defending her puppies. Odysseus has to restrain his doglike heart, because it is nudging him to act too soon, rather than follow through carefully on his plan. In our culture, "bitch" is used as an insult term only for women, and it implies a kind of malice that is imagined as specifically feminine. In [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic}, to be "doglike" does not usually connote this kind of malice or cruelty (which is why "bitch" would be a misleading translation). Instead, it suggests an insistent drive, to be fed or satisfied or noticed, which is impatient and oblivious to social cues and constraints. Dogs are kept not as pets, but as guards of the house and for hunting; they are low on the household hierarchy, but valued for their persistence and quick powers of observation---shown most touchingly by Odysseus' old dog, Argos, who recognizes his old master even after twenty years' absence. Women, more than men, are like dogs, because they are put low on the social hierarchy, and because they might be scarily capable of seeing through social conventions, and might refuse to stay in their place. But the idea that it is not the woman or goddess herself, but her face, that is like a dog suggests that it might be male perceptions of women, rather than female desires themselves, that threaten the social fabric.

Characteristics that are ostensibly presented as particularly "feminine" often turn out to be rather more complicated in their metaphorical gendering. For example, female characters tend to achieve their ends by seduction, deceit, or witchcraft, rather than by open aggression. Helen, who has a particular power to control perceptions and see through appearances, puts a special drug in her guests' cup which can enable them to forget all that they have suffered and even be numb to the greatest possible grief or loss:

> [Whoever drinks this mixture from the bowl]{.italic}

> [will shed no tears that day, not even if]{.italic}

> [her mother or her father die, nor even]{.italic}

> [if soldiers kill her brother or her darling]{.italic}

> [son with bronze spears before her very eyes.]{.italic}
> [ (4.223--27)]{.calibre4}

Helen's drug is a frightening exaggeration of the normal cheering power of wine, and it hints at her witchlike powers of fascination: in Helen's house, all eyes are always on Helen. The goddess Circe and the Sirens also have the power to trap their victims through enchantment. But it remains unclear whether deceit is being presented as a naturally feminine mode of operation, since Odysseus himself is the most prominent liar and trickster in the poem; nor is deceit necessarily seen as a bad thing in the world of [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic}.

Prudent, clever Penelope shows her capacity for clever deceit and false storytelling, as well as her technical expertise (as a weaver), which in many ways parallels the sharp wits and practical abilities of her husband. The suitors are attracted to her not only for her wealth and her beauty, but also for her mind; even the brashest of them, Antinous, can wax eloquent in describing Penelope's abilities.

> [Athena blessed her with intelligence,]{.italic}

> [great artistry and skill, a finer mind]{.italic}

> [than anyone has ever had before,]{.italic}

> [even the braided girls of ancient Greece.]{.italic}
> [ (2.116--19)]{.calibre4}

She weaves a great piece of cloth that is supposedly the shroud in which Laertes will be buried and convinces the suitors that she cannot marry any of them until the task is completed. This delaying tactic shows her capacity for deceptive storytelling---a quality shared by her husband---as well as her technical skill in weaving, which is analogous to her husband's competence as a construction worker. But we should also notice differences. The things Odysseus constructs (such as the Wooden Horse, his raft to get away from Calypso, and his bed) are finished, and are supposed to remain finished. Penelope's weaving is designed to be undone. Moreover, whereas the deceptive plots of Odysseus are geared towards a particular end (to invade a city, to reach his home, or to destroy the suitors), the deceptive plot of Penelope serves in the opposite direction: to hold off an end point, to avoid the end of the story. It is meant to be forever in a state of becoming, not completion.

We get only glimpses of Penelope's state of mind, which is repeatedly described as ambiguous or opaque. What comes across most clearly is her emotional pain. She is in a state of constant apprehension for her young, vulnerable son, constant grief for her lost husband, and constant doubt about how long she can put off the suitors. Penelope knows that marriage to one of them will mean an enormous, wrenching loss; for one thing, remarriage may uproot her from the house to which she feels a deep attachment, the house in which she has lived for her whole adult life: "this beautiful rich house, so full of life / my lovely bridal home. I think I will / remember it forever, even in / my dreams." But she also knows that she may ultimately have little choice; she cannot hold the suitors off forever. In an evocative passage from Book 19, she tells Odysseus---whom she has still not recognized---about her nightly tears:

> [As when the daughter of Pandareus,]{.italic}

> [the pale gray nightingale, sings beautifully]{.italic}

> [when spring has come, and sits among the leaves]{.italic}

> [that crowd the trees, and warbles up and down]{.italic}

> [a symphony of sound, in mourning for]{.italic}

> [her son by Zethus, darling Itylus,]{.italic}

> [whom she herself had killed in ignorance.]{.italic}
> [ (19.520--26)]{.calibre4}

The simile suggests that Penelope feels a desperate and ambiguous kind of guilt about the husband and son whom she may be forced to "betray," through no fault of her own. Later in the same passage, Penelope tells the story of a dream she had in which there were geese in her house, eating her corn, which were destroyed by an eagle. Odysseus, in his guise as a beggar, immediately interprets the dream to his own advantage: the dream shows, he says, that her husband will return and rout the suitors from the hall. It is, he assumes, unambiguously positive. But Odysseus' interpretation entirely ignores the most striking feature: Penelope says that in the dream, she "wept and wailed" at the death of the geese. This dream response suggests that on some level, Penelope might not want her husband to come home. This would be a perfectly reasonable feeling, since her position in the household is not markedly improved by his return. But when she learns that her suitors really are dead, Penelope is "overjoyed"---although she still refuses to accept that the old beggar might be her husband in disguise. Penelope's feelings are mixed and confusing.

Some readers have argued that this clever woman may well have recognized her husband much earlier than she lets on, or at least half-recognized him. Perhaps she has; the text seems to allow for this possibility, although it gives us little evidence for it. But it is important to see what is at stake in the decision to interpret Penelope as either cognizant or ignorant of her husband's identity. Some critics have been understandably motivated by a desire not to see female characters as victims---and therefore want to see her as more in control than she may appear. Alternatively, one can emphasize the ways that female characters can be disempowered in a male-dominated environment, through no fault of their own; one can then argue that Athena and Odysseus work together to keep Penelope in the dark about her husband's return. In this view, she is presented as an intelligent woman whose capacity for planning and forethought is comparable to her husband's---but who lacks the apparatus of divine and human help that enable Odysseus to achieve his ends with confidence. Penelope's cognitive disadvantage parallels the sexual double standards by which Odysseus' infidelities are treated as normal, and Penelope's twenty-year sexual loyalty is seen by certain characters within the poem (such as the dead Agamemnon) as the centerpiece of her moral worth.

These radically different interpretations are possible because the text keeps the reader or listener of the poem to a large extent in the dark about Penelope's state of mind. This might be a mark of discomfort with the gender inequalities implicit in the plot or a mark of the text's particular kinds of blindness. There are certain particularly ambiguous moments in the depiction of Penelope that underline this narrative tension. For instance, in Book 18, Penelope suddenly decides to show herself before the suitors, although she has previously shunned them. We are told that the reason is to increase their desire for her and promote her own honor. One can assume that it is Athena, not the mortal woman, who is controlling events at this point and who has decided to make Penelope show herself. Or one can argue that Penelope herself has recognized her husband, and has decided to do this to continue her plot to deceive the suitors about her true intentions. Or one may argue that Penelope has not recognized Odysseus, but simply feels the impulse to gain greater attention from the suitors for herself---a possibility that has been neglected by most critics only because it is assumed, with obvious sexism, that a "good" woman would not behave in such a way. The most important point to notice here is how ambiguous the text itself is about these various possibilities, a fact reinforced by Penelope's "mysterious" laugh as she makes the proposal. Penelope's desires and motivations are defined as unknown.

[Becoming a Man]{.calibre1}

[The Odyssey]{.italic} tells the story not only of Odysseus and Penelope, but also of their son, Telemachus, whose slow and incomplete journey to adulthood is charted in the course of the poem. Telemachus is the most vulnerable member of the family: the suitors plot to murder him, and we see him break down in tears after a failed attempt to speak up and assert himself in the men's assembly. The boy must be at least twenty years old at the time of the poem's action, and he is physically an adult, full grown and handsome. But he struggles to grow to psychological maturity, to become man enough to help his father defeat the suitors. Telemachus' standard epithet, [pepenumenos]{.italic}, suggests "of sound understanding" or "thoughtful"; the poem traces the boy's developing cognitive maturity, as he begins to learn what adult masculinity might mean.

In the course of Telemachus' journey in search of news about his father, he meets two alternative father-figures: the controlling, long-winded Nestor, and the rich, narcissistic, uxorious Menelaus. Each of these men seem to echo character traits in Telemachus' own father---as does the old Sea God Proteus described by Menelaus, a slippery character who can change his shape at will. Back in Ithaca, the swineherd Eumaeus is an even more devoted alternative father: he greets Telemachus on his return like a long-lost son,

> > > [Just as a father, when he sees]{.italic}

> [his own dear son, his only son, his dear]{.italic}

> [most precious boy, returned from foreign lands]{.italic}

> [after ten years of grieving for his loss,]{.italic}

> [welcomes him; so the swineherd wrapped his arms]{.italic}

> [around godlike Telemachus and kissed him,]{.italic}

> [as if he were returning from the dead.]{.italic}
> [ (16.17--23)]{.calibre4}

Eumaeus, Nestor, and Menelaus all show their deep, fatherlike love for Telemachus, and each models for the boy, in significantly different ways, the skill of hospitality, which is an essential aspect of elite masculine adulthood.

But only his real father, Odysseus himself, can help Telemachus achieve what he most wants: a position of greater power in his own household. When father and son are reunited, they weep together, as if for Telemachus' lost, fatherless childhood:

> [They both felt deep desire for lamentation,]{.italic}

> [and wailed with cries as shrill as birds, like eagles]{.italic}

> [or vultures, when the hunters have deprived them]{.italic}

> [of fledglings who have not yet learned to fly.]{.italic}
> [ (16.216--19)]{.calibre4}

After these tears, Telemachus seems more sure of himself, and he can begin the process of joining the adult, male world, by plotting with his father how to kill the suitors.

Telemachus is an only child; his lack of brothers is emphasized in the poem and was presumably unusual in the context of archaic Greek society. He seems markedly more confident after he has formed a close friendship with Pisistratus, Nestor's son, who becomes like a brother to him. The suitors---boys roughly his own age, who act like bullying older brothers---threaten his life and his position in his own home. Unable to stand up to the suitors by himself, Telemachus instead practices masculine self-assertion by putting down his mother.

The relationship between Penelope and Telemachus is painful, full of conflict and secrecy. She sees his vulnerability too clearly and worries for him, which makes him all the more eager to distance himself from her. Penelope cannot do for her son what a father could do, which is introduce him to the world of male power. Under the instructions of Athena, Telemachus pointedly keeps his journey from Ithaca a secret from his mother. Underlining his emotional distance from his mother by insisting that her feelings matter only insofar as they might affect her looks, he tells Eurycleia, who is in on the secret,

> > ["Promise me you will not tell]{.italic}

> [Mother, until she notices me gone.]{.italic}

> [Say nothing for twelve days, so she will not]{.italic}

> [start crying; it would spoil her pretty skin."]{.italic}
> [ (2.373--76)]{.calibre4}

Eurycleia is an alternative mother-figure for Telemachus, and a preferable one, in that---being a slave---she always does exactly what he tells her to do. Athena is a second and even better mother-figure: she enables him to succeed on his trip away from Ithaca, proving his ability to act independently of his human parents, albeit always under her watchful eyes.

Telemachus makes several attempts to put his real mother in (what he regards as) her place. In Book 1, Penelope tries to stop the singer Phemius from telling of the disastrous homecoming of the Greeks from Troy, because it makes her cry too much; Telemachus roughly intervenes, telling his mother,

> ["Go in and do your work.]{.italic}

> [Stick to the loom and distaff. Tell your slaves]{.italic}

> [to do their chores as well. It is for men]{.italic}

> [to talk, especially me. I am the master."]{.italic}
> [ (1.356--59)]{.calibre4}

The passage is echoed in Book 21, when Odysseus, disguised as an old homeless beggar, asks to be given a turn at the ongoing contest to string the great bow. The suitors try to prevent it, but Penelope insists that the stranger ought to be treated with dignity and kindness, and should be allowed to try the bow, if he so desires. At that, young Telemachus intervenes, scolding his mother for speaking as if she had the authority to decide who should and who should not have access to the weapons of his father. He sends her back upstairs to the women's quarters, declaring,

> > > > ["Go up and work]{.italic}

> [with loom and distaff; tell your girls the same.]{.italic}

> [The bow is work for men, especially me.]{.italic}

> [I am the one with power in this house."]{.italic}
> [ (21.350--53)]{.calibre4}

These outbursts are startling, since most of the time Telemachus carefully avoids direct confrontations with his mother---as if nervous that he might not be able to hold his own against her. The lines in Book 21 seem to allude to a moment in [The]{.italic}
[Iliad]{.italic} when Hector tells his wife, Andromache, that she should not attempt to prevent him from going back to the battlefront, although he may be killed. It is, he declares, his task, as an elite male warrior, to fight on the front lines and risk his life to gain honor---just as it is the task of women to do the household chores and weaving. "War," says Hector, "is work for men, especially me." Telemachus is trying to assert his masculinity and adult status by assuming the role of the heroic fighter who risks his life for his honor and the defense of his city. But the reference does not entirely suit the situation: Telemachus is not planning to fight with the bow himself, only to have control over who else gets access to it. Moreover, the person who is about to assume "power in the house" is not Telemachus but Odysseus, to whom the boy will give the bow. Telemachus is overjoyed at being taken under his father's wing, but he is also overshadowed by his father's position as the eternal head of the household. It would be a problem for the poem's narrative if Telemachus grew up all the way, since there must be only one man running the house in Ithaca forever, and that man needs to be Odysseus.

Telemachus is consistent in his notion that masculine maturity means the suppression and exclusion of women and the suppression of female voices. When Odysseus slaughters the suitors, he leaves a final task to his son, Telemachus: the killing of the "doglike" slave women who have been sleeping with the suitors. Odysseus instructs his son to hack at the girls with swords, to eradicate all life from their bodies and all memory of what they did with the murdered men:

> > > > "[They will forget the things]{.italic}

> [the suitors made them do with them in secret."]{.italic}
> [ (22.444--45)]{.calibre4}

The episode is one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem, the culmination of a pattern in which the homecoming of Odysseus prevents other people---elite boys and slave girls alike---from reaching their homes and their comfortable beds:

> [As doves or thrushes spread their wings to fly]{.italic}

> [home to their nests, but someone sets a trap]{.italic}---

> [they crash into a net, a bitter bedtime.]{.italic}
> [ (22.468--70)]{.calibre4}

These terrible murders are not quite presented as punishments for a nonexistent crime; these women are slaves, who presumably had little choice about their treatment by the suitors. Rather, Odysseus wants the girls dead because their memories threaten his total ownership of his household. As long as they are still alive, the trace of the suitors is still present in their bodies and their minds, and hence in his home. By slashing them with "long swords," Odysseus suggests that his own male line can regain complete control.

But Telemachus takes initiative, to an almost unprecedented degree, and decides that the women should instead be hanged, saying,

> > > ["I refuse to grant these girls]{.italic}

> [a clean death, since they poured down shame on me]{.italic}

> [and Mother, when they lay beside the suitors."]{.italic}
> [ (22.462--64)]{.calibre4}

This puzzling, disturbing intervention is a defining moment for Telemachus. Why exactly does he want them hanged, rather than hacked to death with swords? One possible answer has to do with cleanliness and pollution. Despite Odysseus' various attempts to present his killings as revenge for moral outrages committed against him, it is clear that at least some of the murders are primarily motivated by a desire to restore a sense of purity to a house that has been subject to imaginary dirt. The choice of hanging over hacking is beneficial in that it keeps the girls' dirty blood off the clean floors, and maintains the "tainted" bodies in their self-contained state. Hanging also allows young Telemachus to avoid being too close to these girls' abused, sexualized bodies. The boy here demonstrates a newfound maturity in two highly problematic ways: he asserts himself by defying his father's instructions, and he belittles the women he slaughters. But Telemachus is still resisting the adult male role of the warrior, which involves a quasi-sexual act of penetration---using a sharp weapon to pierce and kill human bodies at close quarters.

In the final book of the poem, Telemachus has one more chance to prove himself a man, by fighting, yet again, beside his father. With their little band of supporters, Odysseus, Laertes, and Telemachus prepare together to fight against the family members of those whom they have killed. Odysseus calls on Telemachus not to "shame your father's family," which is "known across the world for courage / and manliness." Telemachus responds eagerly, "Just watch me, Father," and Laertes beams with pride: "A happy day for me! My son and grandson / are arguing about how tough they are!" The fight is curtailed by Athena's intervention, so Telemachus never gets to prove his full worth as a fighter, although he has demonstrated his eagerness to participate in the military aggression of his male family members. Readers may disagree about the extent to which Telemachus ever fully grows up in [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey---]{.italic}as well as about whether growing up to manhood, as this boy imagines it, would really be a good thing.

[Slaves]{.calibre1}

Many of the most prominent characters in [The]{.italic}
[Odyssey]{.italic}---such as the father, mother, son, and the suitors---are elite people who live in what is figured as a large, palatial house (although it is clearly modest from the perspective of later forms of kingship). Odysseus is a leader in war, not a mere foot soldier, and in Ithaca, the house of Odysseus is the richest and most powerful of the neighborhood. But the poem also includes a number of characters who are not rich or powerful. In [The Iliad]{.italic}, the only named non-elite character, Thersites, is presented as ugly and annoying; when he speaks out of turn, Odysseus beats him up. [The Odyssey]{.italic} includes a far richer array of characters who are not lords or ladies, kings or princesses. Slaves and homeless beggars are presented in this text as human beings who deserve respect and even empathy---at least as long as they remain in their limited social place.

The possibility that people of any rank might be enslaved---through trafficking or war---is assumed as a fact about the world; [The Odyssey]{.italic} is not an abolitionist text. But we are given glimpses of the hard lives of those who serve and feed the privileged people who are the main focus of the narrative. In Book 20, the prayer of an unnamed, frail slave, grinding the grain, reminds us that the labor of food production is exhausting: it hurts her knees. Odysseus, who has his own agenda, treats the prayer simply as a good omen for his own plans. But the reader or listener can momentarily see the cost of running the elite household in terms of human labor and human suffering---a cost that may be reduced but will not end, even when the banquets of the suitors cease.

Slave owners favor slaves who ally themselves most closely with their master's interests, rather than taking the risky step of switching to a new set of masters. Only one of the slaves who slept with the suitors is named: Melantho, who is characterized as having a mind of her own and a will to talk back to her mistress. The orifices of female slaves, including their mouths, are a source of particular concern; the rope deprives Melantho of her attempt to have an autonomous voice. Male slaves are imagined not as mouths but limbs of their masters; a "bad" male slave uses his capacity to work or fight or procreate to serve an alternative master. Melantho's brother, Melanthius, who serves as a herdsman for the suitors, is trussed up like an animal, and then, in a particularly brutal scene, his nose, ears, genitals, hands, and feet are slashed off. This "limb" of the wrong masters is robbed of his own bodily appendages. Melantho and Melanthius---whose names both suggest "black flower"---are the children of Dolius, the herdsman who is treated as a trusted favorite, loyal to Odysseus. We are not told how he feels about the slaughter of his children, but it is clear that, in Odysseus' remade household, there will be no possibility of expressing such grief. The name Dolius suggests "crafty" or "deceitful"; the poem shows us why dishonesty is the most essential survival tool for the "good" slave.

The pair of young "bad" slaves are mirrored by a pair of old "good" slaves, who are loyal to Odysseus and his family. Eurycleia, the old slave woman who took care of Telemachus as a baby and now protects the master's domestic stores, provides a counterpart to the threats posed by Melantho. She is old enough to pose no sexual threat, and she controls her voice for the sake of her masters---by keeping the secrets of Telemachus' journey and Odysseus' identity, and by restraining her impulse to shout in triumph over the slaughter of the suitors. Melantho's physical intimacy with the wrong set of owners is presented as a threat to the household. Eurycleia, by contrast, maintains the household by taking care of the bodies of Odysseus and his family---by helping Telemachus get dressed, and by washing Odysseus' feet.

The most prominent slave character in the poem is the swineherd Eumaeus, the "good" counterpart to the "bad" goatherd, Melanthius. Eumaeus welcomes Odysseus, in his guise as beggar, into his simple cottage. Eumaeus' humble but affectionate offering of [xenia]{.italic} contrasts with the rudeness of the suitors, and we are clearly supposed to admire this "noble slave" for identifying his own interests with those of his owner; he is the one who "cared most about preserving / the master's property." No other character is addressed directly by the narrator, but Eumaeus is often addressed in the second person ("You, swineherd"), a stylistic detail that creates a particular intimacy between the reader or listener and this odd character. Eumaeus is also described repeatedly in the terms of military heroism, as the "commander" of his pigs---a trope that serves both to elevate this quasi-heroic character and to mock him. Eumaeus is a "noble slave" for two incompatible reasons. On the one hand, paradoxically, he is noble because he is so slavish: he refuses to disentangle his own interests and perspective from that of his master. But he is also genuinely noble, both in birth and in behavior: he performs the aristocratic customs of [xenia]{.italic} even in his poor, dung-piled shack, and he tells the memorable, grim story of how he was born into an elite foreign household, before he was trafficked and sold as a slave. The "good" slave is one who responds to the trauma of enslavement by identifying with his or her owners, and imagining those in power as loving parents rather than overlords. [The Odyssey]{.italic} seems to have it both ways in the depiction of slave characters. We are reminded that a good slave can be more loyal and more hospitable than a rude, overprivileged young man, but we are also invited to imagine that slaves are good only insofar as they subdue their own identities to those of their owners.

The poem suggests a similar contrast between the "good" and the "bad" way to occupy another lowly social position: that of the penniless, homeless migrant. When Odysseus is in disguise as a poor beggar, the ways that people respond to him are presented as the test of their moral worth. It is a black mark against the suitors that they fail to behave politely or warmly to the wrinkled, ragged, hungry old stranger who shows up in the palace where they are living it up on somebody else's meat and wine. But the "real" beggar, Irus---who is not an elite warrior in disguise, but a genuinely poor, dirty homeless person---is depicted in entirely negative terms. Odysseus wrestles with him, wins, and humiliates him, and the text seems to invite us to celebrate his victory. There is thus a certain uneasiness about the proper way to respond to social and economic hierarchies. Elite people are supposed to treat slaves and homeless beggars well; but slaves and homeless beggars are themselves to be despised, unless they are royalty in disguise. Odysseus can become old, poor, weak and homeless; but his "real" identity is (apparently, but perhaps debatably) as the king and warrior who fights to gain massive wealth and assert his own masculine prowess, using deceit and violence to slaughter his enemies---both on the battlefield of Troy and even in his own lovely home.

Odysseus presents himself as someone who has endured exceptional trials and tribulations and has managed, alone, to survive the perils and dangers of his journey back from Troy. After listening to the swineherd Eumaeus tell the story of how he was captured and trafficked as a child, entering a lifelong position as a lowly slave, Odysseus comments that Eumaeus' sufferings can hardly match his own: "Your life is good. / But as for me, I am still lost." Odysseus suggests that his own inability to reach his homeland, even after twenty years' absence, is the ultimate form of suffering, which trumps all other pain. But it is notable that Odysseus travels in elite fashion, without ever touching the oars himself. That lowly hard labor is performed for him by others, men who are uncompensated for their labor, and who all, eventually, die before reaching their homes.

[The Choice of Odysseus]{.calibre1}

At the start of the poem, we see Odysseus making a momentous and defining choice: to return to Penelope, his mortal wife, rather than stay forever with the goddess Calypso. This goddess is divinely beautiful, and her island is marked by luxuriant, dense complexity; it is a place of secrets and tangled mixtures.

> [The scent of citrus and of brittle pine]{.italic}

> [suffused the island. Inside, she was singing]{.italic}

> [and weaving with a shuttle made of gold.]{.italic}

> [Her voice was beautiful. Around the cave]{.italic}

> [a luscious forest flourished: alder, poplar,]{.italic}

> [and scented cypress. It was full of wings.]{.italic}

> [Birds nested there but hunted out at sea:]{.italic}

> [the owls, the hawks, the gulls with gaping beaks.]{.italic}

> [A ripe and luscious vine, hung thick with grapes,]{.italic}

> [was stretched to coil around her cave. Four springs]{.italic}

> [spurted with sparkling water as they laced]{.italic}

> [with crisscross currents intertwined together.]{.italic}

> [The meadow softly bloomed with celery]{.italic}

> [and violets.]{.italic}
> [ (5.60--73)]{.calibre4}

The god Hermes, visiting Calypso's home, is understandably "full of wonder." But Odysseus, in this magical, mysterious place where he shares the bed of a majestic goddess, is miserable.

> > > > > > [His eyes were always]{.italic}

> [tearful; he wept sweet life away, in longing]{.italic}

> [to go back home, since she no longer pleased him.]{.italic}

> [He had no choice. He spent his nights with her]{.italic}

> [inside her hollow cave, not wanting her]{.italic}

> [though she still wanted him. By day he sat]{.italic}

> [out on the rocky beach, in tears and grief,]{.italic}

> [staring in heartbreak at the fruitless sea.]{.italic}
> [ (5.151--58)]{.calibre4}

The text implies that for some (carefully unspecified) amount of time, Odysseus willingly enjoyed the company of the goddess. Calypso rescued him when he crawled, ragged and half drowned, onto the shore of her island, and he spends a good seven years---the majority of time spent returning from the war---sharing her bed. She has given him shelter from the storm and has provided him with a home that seems in certain very obvious ways superior to his original home on Ithaca. As she herself reminds him with touching defensiveness, the goddess is much more attractive than Penelope. Moreover, Calypso's island is lush and fertile, in contrast to barren Ithaca---and, what ought to be a clinching argument in the case, she has the power to make Odysseus immortal and free from aging forever. She offers him everything, except a way back to his original, human home. Outraged at his rejection of her love, she asks him,

> > > > ["Do you really want]{.italic}

> [to go back to that home you love so much?]{.italic}

> [Well then, good-bye! But if you understood]{.italic}

> [how glutted you will be with suffering]{.italic}

> [before you reach your home, you would stay here]{.italic}

> [with me and be]{.italic}
> [immortal---though you might]{.italic}

> [still wish to see that wife you always pine for.]{.italic}

> [And anyway, I know my body is]{.italic}

> [better than hers is. I am taller too.]{.italic}

> [Mortals can never rival the immortals]{.italic}

The depiction of Calypso, a powerful but emotionally open female character, frustrated in her desire for the human she has rescued, is one of the most memorable sequences in the poem. She perhaps does herself a disservice in emphasizing only her superior good looks. She also has a superior mind, and she is particularly well matched with Odysseus, who shares her fondness for secrets. Like Circe and Athena, Calypso appreciates and understands Odysseus' capacity for deceit and scheming, because she has similar qualities herself---albeit at a divine, more than mortal level. She praises him for mistrusting her, saying, "You scalawag! What you have said / shows that you understand how these things work." Penelope, for obvious reasons, shows far less appreciation for Odysseus the liar, Odysseus the trickster, Odysseus the "scalawag." Her looks are ordinary compared with those of the goddess; her love for Odysseus is more careful, more suspicious, and her understanding of him is less complete; and in choosing Penelope, Odysseus is also choosing to become old and, eventually, to die. In reply to the goddess, Odysseus acknowledges the truth of everything she says. But then he adds simply, "But even so, I want to go back home, / and every day I hope that day will come."

Why exactly does Odysseus make this surprising choice? The poem never gives us an explicit answer---an omission that makes the hero's yearning for home all the more resonant and moving. Calypso, an obviously prejudiced observer, suggests that Odysseus' choice to go home is masochistic: a deliberate embrace of suffering, and a perverse preference for something worse over something better. The tactful hero does not correct her.

Presumably, Odysseus is inspired by a deep loyalty to his wife, son, father, and the place of his birth, and moved by a deep and constant love for those he left behind. But we must avoid projecting the anachronistic ideas of chivalric romantic love onto Odysseus, who is not a medieval knight performing valiant deeds for the sake of a beautiful lady. To explain the meaning of Odysseus' choice in Homeric terms, it is useful to look back to [The Iliad]{.italic}. In that poem, the central character, Achilles, makes the momentous choice to stay and fight at Troy, to gain honor among his fellow Greek warriors, rather than return home to his young son and dying father, where he might have lived a long life in obscurity. The choice of Odysseus is parallel to the choice of Achilles, in that it is a decision to be mortal in order to gain a particular kind of masculine honor. If Odysseus had stayed with Calypso, he would have been alive forever, and never grown old; but he would have been forever subservient to a being more powerful than himself. He would have lost forever the possibility of being king of Ithaca, owner of the richest and most dominant household on his island---an estate wealthy in pigs, sheep, goats, fruit, grain, wine, and slaves, with an old father, a young son, and a desirable, much-courted, and valuable wife all devoted to him, and all increasing his value in the eyes of his neighbors.

But strangely, Odysseus' choice to be in the mortal world does not seem to imply any willingness to submit to the exigencies of change. The hero wants to maintain his dominant position in his household, not for a moment but for all time. His choice to be subject to age and mortality is presented as if it were itself a permanent fact, a choice that he might be able to go on making forever. [The Odyssey]{.italic} thus makes a paradoxical set of claims about the possibility of permanence, either in relationships or in the lives of any individual person. Odysseus' choice to be with Penelope is associated not only with an admission of human mortality, but also with its opposite: an insistence that a man (it has to be a man) might be able to claim or reclaim a permanent position at the head of his particular social ladder. Odysseus seems to be magically able to evade the pressure of time on mortals and rise above all challenges of circumstance.

Athena changes Odysseus into a weak, bent old man, as a disguise. But when needed, she changes him back into the physical appearance that is figured as his "true" self, a man of the utmost vigor, in the prime of youth. In real life, a man who had left home in his twenties, spent ten years fighting a war, and then another ten lost at sea, would be more likely to look wrinkled, bent, and old---especially in an archaic society without modern medicine, when life expectancy was far shorter than in most contemporary Western cultures. But [The Odyssey]{.italic} insists that Odysseus is fundamentally unchanged by his adventures. Through his determination and smart mind, and with divine help, he can restore his marriage and his household permanently to the state that they were in when he first went away. Leaving Calypso is thus not only a choice to accept mortality and impermanence, but also, incompatibly, a choice to insist on the fantasy of permanent patriarchal dominance over a carefully regulated human household.

Odysseus is an odd figure to represent permanence, since he seems to be constantly changing---in appearance, behavior, and social role. He is able to be, at different times, young or old, strong or weak, a beggar or a home owner, a victim or an aggressor. What makes Odysseus special is that he is, to a far larger extent than most human beings, in control of his various different changes and manifestations. Gods can disguise themselves and walk unseen through the midst of mortals; Odysseus is able to do the same. He switches roles not only through the magical power of Athena, which transforms his appearance, but also through the magical power of his own words, through which he creates multiple different identities for himself.

Most of the epithets applied to Odysseus begin with the prefix [poly-]{.italic}, meaning "much" or "many": he is a figure who possesses many attributes, and possesses them intensely. Far more than other mortals, Odysseus is able to change himself to adapt to changing circumstances. A wonderful simile in Book 5, after Odysseus is shipwrecked and clings, just barely, to the rocks of the Phaeacian shore, compares his skinned fingers to the suckers of an octopus:

> [As when an octopus dragged from its den,]{.italic}

> [has many pebbles sticking to its suckers,]{.italic}

> [so his strong hands were skinned against the rocks.]{.italic}
> [ (5.432--34)]{.calibre4}

In archaic Greek lore, the octopus was known as the "boneless one," the creature that (supposedly) survives hunger by eating its own tentacles (or "feet," of which, luckily, it has eight). In the Homeric image, it is a creature defined by its tenacity. It is resistant to change (it has to be dragged from its den), but also changed by its altered environment (the sticking pebbles). Odysseus' fingers are like the pebbles of the den, ripped by the octopus; but he is also himself octopuslike in his stubbornness, his power of survival, his capacity to adapt to new environments, his multiplicity, and his slippery, boneless, self-devouring ability to change. It is this power of self-transformation that gives him the ability to reinvent himself into the most marvelous persona of all: the self he was twenty years ago, before he went to war. The ideal of total autonomy and permanent essence depends on the process of constant self-reinvention.

An essential aspect of Odysseus' multiplicity is his rhetorical ability and capacity for deceit. He is able to spin tall tales, to take over from the poet Demodocus and tell the fantastic story of his own adventures as an entertainment for the Phaeacians. In Ithaca, he constructs multiple different autobiographies, usually claiming to have come from Crete---the traditional home of liars. Odysseus' grandfather Autolycus prides himself on "telling lies and stealing"; Odysseus has inherited these traits. He is the hero who always has an answer, a solution, a fix, a good line, a quick reply to any challenge. He is the master of finding the right words in any situation.

Odysseus is in disguise in Ithaca and has to be recognized by a series of different characters in turn. The poem is virtuosic in its variations on the otherwise formulaic "recognition scene"---each character recognizes Odysseus by a different means, and each character recognizes a different Odysseus. Athena, who has no trouble recognizing Odysseus, begins the sequence in Book 13 by allowing him to recognize her and, in so doing, to recognize himself, as the man defined by cleverness and an infinite capacity for scheming and deceit. Argos, the old dog, recognizes Odysseus by his smell and remembers him as the vigorous man who took him on hunting trips. Eumaeus knows Odysseus as a benevolent owner, a quasi-family-member, who may perhaps reward his lifelong loyalty with a short period of freedom before he dies. Telemachus knows Odysseus as his role-model father, the man on whom his own honor and status in the world of adult men depends. Eurycleia, the old slave nurse, remembers Odysseus as a boy wonder, who killed a boar single-handedly even in his earliest youth. Old Laertes knows Odysseus as his son and heir; he is the boy who was taught to name all the trees in the orchard, and he is the man on whom the future of the whole estate depends. Antinous and the other suitors recognize, with horror, that the weak old beggar in their midst is actually a muscular, murderous fighter, the man who will slaughter them all.

The most complex and extensive recognition is that of Penelope. The process by which she comes to acknowledge the old stranger as her difficult, secretive, aggressive husband is extraordinarily long-drawn-out, and the exact moment at which she truly recognizes him remains a mystery---like so much else about Penelope. After the murder of the suitors, she is told by both Eurycleia and Telemachus that the strange old beggar is really Odysseus. To Telemachus' irritation, however, she refuses to acknowledge him as her husband. "Cautious Penelope" displays her central quality by resisting any quick resolution. Perhaps she suspects or half-knows who he is much earlier than she admits; or perhaps she genuinely remains unsure about who the mysterious stranger is.

But if she does recognize him, or half-recognize him, she also manages to gain an upper hand in the relationship, provoking Odysseus into "proving" his identity. She tells the slave to make up the bed for him outside the bedroom, which devastates and enrages him: "Woman!" he asks, "Who moved my bed?" The bed, it turns out, is not supposed to be movable; Odysseus claims to have built it himself, using an olive tree that grew inside the palace as a bedpost. The bed that can be moved only by cutting down the trunk and destroying the structure is a metonymic symbol for the interdependence of the marriage and the house; the destruction of either means ruin for the other. Odysseus asks, in disbelief as well as horror, what "man" has moved his bed: the quasi-immovable bed represents a fantasy that it would be almost impossible for Penelope ever to sleep with another man. No other marriage would involve such deep roots.

The tree-bed is the ultimate answer to the question raised at the start of the poem: What does Odysseus choose when he rejects Calypso's offer? It is something deeply characteristic of Odysseus himself: like his most famous invention, the Wooden Horse, the bed is a wood structure that contains humans and a secret, and allows close friends to inhabit a hidden place of safety, even surrounded by enemies. Odysseus, the master storyteller, is also the master builder---of horses, ships, beds, plans of attack, and means of escape. As soon as Calypso allows her lover to leave her island, he begins work constructing a raft; his detailed, obsessive account of how he built his marriage bed echoes that earlier moment of construction. In leaving Calypso, Odysseus chooses something that he built with his own mind and hands, rather than something given to him. Whereas Calypso longs to hide, clothe, feed, and possess him, Athena enables Odysseus to construct his own schemes out of the materials she provides.

But the bed is a product of nature, as well as of human labor; it is growing, alive, and divinely blessed. Trees are not, in fact, permanent or immovable objects; Odysseus cuts down trees to make his raft. This bed is thus a rather different kind of symbol from the nailed-down bed to which the frustrated narrator of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper" is confined (a symbol of the restrictions imposed on women in nineteenth-century New England). Odysseus' bed is difficult to move, but not immovable. Its permanence and its mutability stem from the same cause---the life of the olive tree. In returning to Ithaca and to this bed, Odysseus has chosen a world in which his own work is part of something larger than himself, and where he is woven into relationships that are both rooted and changing.

When Penelope and Odysseus are finally reunited, Odysseus puts his arms around his wife, and a simile invokes the experience of shipwrecked swimmers, suddenly catching sight of land, and crawling to shore, "their skin all caked with brine." We must initially think that this image applies primarily to Odysseus himself---who is the one embracing Penelope when the image begins and who has, in real life, experienced shipwreck. But the narrator then suggests that it is Penelope, not Odysseus, who is like these survivors: "So glad she was to see her own dear husband, / and her white arms would not let go his neck." A surprising slippage happens through the imagery, from the man's to the woman's point of view. With Calypso, Odysseus would have been frozen into the role of the weak, dependent survivor of shipwreck. The mortal Penelope may not know all of Odysseus' many identities and may not have plumbed his capacity for lies. But she understands his suffering, because she too has lived through twenty years of pain---caused by his own absence, in war and with Calypso.

[Hated Odysseus]{.calibre1}

Odysseus is defined by his mutual loving relationships---with his wife, Penelope; his patron goddess, Athena; his father, Laertes; his dead mother, Anticleia; his son, Telemachus---and by his less-mutual loving relationships with Calypso, Nausicaa, Eurycleia, and Circe. He is also defined, even more explicitly, by his enemies, those who hate him and dislike him. In Book 19, we learn about Odysseus' grandfather Autolycus, whose own name suggests "Real Wolf," and "who was the best / of all mankind at telling lies and stealing." Autolycus gave the baby Odysseus his name, based on the fact that he himself has managed to make so many enemies:

> > > > > > ["I am]{.italic}

> [disliked by many, all across the world,]{.italic}

> [and I dislike them back."]{.italic}
> [ (19.406--8)]{.calibre4}

The verb [odussomai,]{.italic} meaning "to be angry at," "to dislike," or "to hate," sounds similar to Odysseus. Athena connects Odysseus with the same verb in Book 1, asking Zeus why he bears a grudge against her favorite: "Why do you dismiss Odysseus?" she asks. The etymology suggests that Odysseus is himself much disliked, by both gods and other human beings, and also that he takes after his grandfather by acting in hostile fashion to other people: he tricks, steals from, and hates. Poseidon is, of course, his most powerful enemy, but Odysseus arouses dislike, hatred, and anger in many others during the course of the narrative, and displays his own capacity for rage.

Odysseus is the hero of his own story, and the poem to some extent glorifies its protagonist and valorizes his claims to dominance. But it also articulates some important questions about the moral qualities of this liar, pirate, colonizer, deceiver, and thief, who is so often in disguise, absent, or napping, while other people---those he owns, those he leads---suffer and die, and who directly kills so many people.

Odysseus' use of aggression and violence is presented as problematic in certain ways. The poem raises questions about whether Odysseus, as a fighter who has spent ten years at war, sacking and pillaging a foreign city, can adapt himself enough to succeed in an entirely different context---or whether he will bring the battlefield home with him. In some cases, we see Odysseus managing to modify the conventions of the Homeric battlefield to fit a new challenge. For instance, when he first meets the young Phaeacian princess Nausicaa, he supplicates her---an action familiar from warriors on the Trojan battlefield, when one man kneels in abjection and touches the knees and beard of another, to beg for his life. But in this new version of the formulaic supplication scene, Odysseus is kneeling before somebody who has no beard and who poses no kind of military threat. The supplicator, in this version, is rather more physically threatening than the person to whom he prays. Odysseus studiously avoids the traditional touching of the knees, which would only alarm the girl, and shows his own ability to adapt techniques practiced at Troy for entirely different situations.

But the poem also seems to question how fully this epic hero can adapt to a new, nonmilitary world. When Odysseus is about to go through the straits between Scylla and Charybdis, Circe warns him not to put on his armor and try to fight against Scylla, which will be futile and will only make the situation worse. But Odysseus insists on doing so---increasing the danger to his men. Similarly, in leaving the island of Polyphemus the Cyclops, Odysseus is unable to resist shouting back,

> ["Cyclops! If any mortal asks you how]{.italic}

> [your eye was mutilated and made blind,]{.italic}

> [say that Odysseus, the]{.italic}
> [city-sacker,]{.italic}

> [Laertes' son, who lives in Ithaca,]{.italic}

> [destroyed your sight."]{.italic}
> [ (9.502--6)]{.calibre4}

Odysseus cannot resist the urge to gain [kleos]{.italic}---the honor that comes from being the named subject of heroic legend. He is able to become nameless ("No man") only for a little while.

One of the epithets most commonly used of Odysseus is [polytlas]{.italic}, which means "much-enduring." It may suggest how much Odysseus has endured and suffered, and it may also suggest how much he is capable of enduring: his stubbornness, his tenacity, his courage, his relentless drive to achieve his own ends. In modern terms, we can see Odysseus as a veteran soldier with his own version of PTSD: he is moody, prone to weeping, often withdrawn, and liable to sudden fits of aggression. We can also, rather differently, see Odysseus as a man who keeps on repeating the same behavior patterns that he has displayed in Troy. He succeeded in taking the foreign city by a mixture of aggression with deceitful infiltration, in the Wooden Horse, which the Trojans themselves took into their town; he succeeds in taking back his own household through much the same means, sneaking inside the house in hidden form (not inside a horse, but inside the body of a beggar), and emerging to slaughter the inhabitants.

Odysseus seems to have complicated feelings about his own past history. The temptation offered by the Sirens is to listen forever, and know everything that the Greeks and Trojans suffered in the war. One might think that Odysseus would want this, above all, as an ego boost: the Sirens address him as the "glory of the Greeks," and their songs promise an endless retelling of Odysseus' own finest hours; they call to him to listen,

> ["since we know everything the Greeks and Trojans]{.italic}

> [suffered in Troy, by gods' will; and we know]{.italic}

> [whatever happens anywhere on earth."]{.italic}
> [ (12.189--91)]{.calibre4}

The temptation is as much knowledge as glory. The Sirens offer Odysseus what no single individual engaged in the conflict can have: a full and complete understanding of what happened in the war and what it meant. In resisting the Sirens, Odysseus acknowledges that he will have to go on acting out the consequences of the war, without ever being able fully to know what it was all about.

Odysseus puts in a special request to Demodocus, the Phaeacian bard, to sing the story of the Wooden Horse---the trick that Odysseus himself devised in order to infiltrate and sack the city. Demodocus complies, and tells how the Greek warriors, including Odysseus, hid inside the manufactured horse; how the Trojans pulled the horse inside, and left it at the summit of their city, as an offering to the gods; and how, during the night, the gang of fighters jumped out of the hollow cavity, scattered across the city, and began slaughtering the people of Troy. One might expect that Odysseus would be happy to hear the story of his own greatest military triumph---a story that, after all, he had just asked to hear. But his response is surprising. Rather than being glad (as he was glad to hear the story of Aphrodite committing adultery), he bursts into tears, and a striking simile seems to conflate his emotional response with that of his own victims.

> [Odysseus was melting into tears;]{.italic}

> [his cheeks were wet with weeping, as a woman]{.italic}

> [weeps, as she falls to wrap her arms around]{.italic}

> [her husband, fallen fighting for his home]{.italic}

> [and children.]{.italic}
> [ (8.521--25)]{.calibre4}

The simile compares the desperate weeping of Odysseus, a military conqueror, to the grief of a woman who is a victim of war, a woman whose husband is dying and who knows that she herself, and her children, will soon be led off into slavery by the victors. Perhaps the comparison suggests that Odysseus himself feels some kind of deep guilt over the suffering that he himself has caused, in his instrumental role in sacking not only Troy but many other towns and settlements. Or perhaps the simile works to downplay Odysseus' responsibility for the suffering he has caused, by inviting us to see him as a suffering victim, even in his role as the sacker of cities.

In the final book of the [Odyssey]{.italic}, after Odysseus has slaughtered the suitors, Eupeithes, the father of one of the dead men, urges the people of Ithaca to rise up together and kill Odysseus in revenge. He offers a searing indictment of Odysseus.

> > > > > > ["This scheming man,]{.italic}

> [my friends, has done us all most monstrous wrongs.]{.italic}

> [First, he took many good men off to sail]{.italic}

> [with him, and lost the ships, and killed the men!]{.italic}

> [Now he has come and murdered all the best]{.italic}

> [of Cephallenia. Come on, before]{.italic}

> [he sneaks away to Pylos or to Elis,]{.italic}

> [we have to act! We will be shamed forever]{.italic}

> [unless we take revenge on him for killing]{.italic}

> [our sons and brothers. I would have no wish]{.italic}

> [to live; I would prefer to die and join]{.italic}

> [the boys already dead. We have to stop them]{.italic}

> [escaping overseas! Come on, right now!"]{.italic}
> [ (24.425--37)]{.calibre4}

The words come from the mouth of a grieving parent whose young son has been shot by Odysseus the day before. It represents a limited, highly personal point of view. Moreover, Eupeithes presumably does not know how unpleasantly his son behaved, when he had the chance to lord it up in the household of the absent Odysseus.

But Eupeithes, whose name means "Persuasive," is making a point that readers of the poem may find surprisingly persuasive---as do the people of Ithaca. Antinous is depicted as an arrogant, supercilious young man, who drinks too much, exploits the resources of an absent home owner, treats Penelope and Telemachus with disrespect, and is cruel and unwelcoming to Odysseus in his guise as a poor migrant. Yet the grief of his father reminds us that the murdered Antinous was very young, probably not much older than Telemachus. Young men often behave oafishly, but they may mature in time---unless they get an arrow through the neck first. Eupeithes' speech reminds us also that the killing of the suitors is not an isolated incident; Odysseus has made an unfortunate habit of leading young men to their deaths. When Odysseus addresses the men who row his ship, he repeatedly calls them "friends," [philoi]{.italic}, a word that suggests a close tie of kinship or love. Odysseus is a smart talker, who knows the best words to use for a particular audience. But the narrator instead calls these men [hetairoi]{.italic}, "companions" or "servants," a term that can suggest a much more hierarchical relationship. Of the troops Odysseus rounded up to take with him to Troy, some fell in battle, and all the rest die in various horrible ways in the course of their leader's journey home.

The first lines of the poem invite us to see these deaths in terms of the dead men's own folly or childish naïveté, because they chose to eat the Cattle of the Sun. They were "poor fools" ([nepioi]{.italic}), a term that suggests childish thoughtlessness. This foolishness is sharply contrasted with Odysseus' own characteristic qualities of scheming intelligence, quick planning, and forward thinking ([metis]{.italic}). But this prologue does not hint at the numerous other deaths suffered by the men in Odysseus' crew---including those who are eaten alive by the sea-monster Scylla when Odysseus chooses to sail past her island; those who are devoured by the Cyclops, thanks to Odysseus' insistence on visiting his cave; or those who are skewered from their ships and eaten by the man-eating giants, the Laestrygonians, when Odysseus docks the fleet at their island and moors only his own ship in a safe place outside the harbor. These deaths clearly have nothing to do with the men's cognitive or moral qualities. The prophet Tiresias predicts that, if Odysseus hurts the Cattle of the Sun, he will arrive home only "late and exhausted, in a stranger's boat, / having destroyed \[his\] men," and a similar prophesy is made by the goddess Circe. The participle here translated as "having destroyed" can also mean "having lost." The ambiguous phrasing matters, because the ultimate responsibility for all these deaths remains an open question.

[Endings]{.calibre1}

The traditional poetic stories of archaic Greece included tales of how the heroes came home from the Trojan War---the [Nostoi]{.italic}, as they were known. [The Odyssey]{.italic} is obviously a story of [nostos]{.italic}, meaning "homecoming" (the word from which we get "nostalgia," the pain of missing home). But the poem suggests that it may not be entirely easy to see what a homecoming is, and when exactly it happens. Coming home means more than simply reaching a particular spatial or geographical location. The hero reaches his home country of Ithaca when the poem is almost exactly halfway through. The remaining books trace a series of journeys across a tiny geographical area: from the port of Ithaca to the loyal swineherd's hut; back and forth between the hut and the palace; from the hallway to the marriage bed, and back again; out from the palace to the orchard, and back again to slaughter his fellow countrymen who are assembled in front of his house. Each of these locations seems to offer a different version of home, and one can wonder when and where Odysseus feels most fully that he has arrived.

Thanks to Athena's magic, Odysseus initially does not recognize Ithaca; it seems like yet another unfamiliar and probably dangerous place. Once the divine mist disperses, Odysseus knows that he is on Ithaca, but we can also see that his initial suspicions were in many ways correct: Ithaca is indeed a dangerous and unfamiliar place, and there are real questions about how and when Odysseus might be able to transform it again into the home that he left behind.

A key part of his strategy for doing so is to test the loyalty and behavior of various members of his household. He appears in disguise to the key players, each in turn, and tests their responses to his own persona as a homeless migrant. Those who pass the test are to be incorporated into Odysseus' plan and restored into the household; those who fail are killed. Thanks to the long process by which Odysseus gradually infiltrates his way into the community of Ithaca, he is able to assess who will help him, and whom he must destroy in order to reassert his own power over his home.

But it is unclear when Odysseus finally achieves his ends and reaches his home, if indeed this moment ever comes. Odysseus is reunited with Penelope, but the poem continues. We see the ghosts of the suitors travel down to the underworld and meet the spirits of Achilles and Agamemnon, which might have been a kind of ending; but the poem continues. We see Odysseus reunite with his old father, Laertes; but the poem continues. Fighting breaks out on Ithaca between Odysseus and his supporters, and the friends and family members of the dead suitors. The battle grows intense, and Odysseus is wild with martial rage; only thanks to the intervention of Athena does it stop. And there the poem ends.

Scholars since antiquity have been puzzled by the ending of [The Odyssey]{.italic}. Two Homeric scholars of the Library of Alexandria in the third and second centuries BCE, Aristarchus of Samothrace and Aristophanes of Byzantium (not the comic playwright), argued that the poem really ended at the moment when Odysseus and Penelope go to bed together; on this model, the real ending is in Book 23, when the narrator tells us,

> > > > > [Finally, at last,]{.italic}

> [with joy the husband and the wife arrived]{.italic}

> [back in the rites of their old marriage bed.]{.italic}
> [ (23.293--95)]{.calibre4}

We do not know what grounds were given by these ancient scholars for treating the end of Book 23 and the whole of 24 as extraneous. Eustathius, a twelfth-century critic, tried to defend Book 24 on literary and semantic grounds, arguing that the recognition scene between Odysseus and his father is an essential element in the story.

Modern scholars have also argued about the "correct" or "original" place for the poem to end. Linguistic arguments have been made against Book 24, but these are highly debatable; Homer's language, as we have seen, is always a mixture of words and phrases from many different dialects and periods. The episode involving the ghosts of the dead suitors is unusual---but the situation is also unusual. The encounter between Laertes and Odysseus seems cruel to some readers, since Odysseus has no need to "test" his father, now that the suitors are already dead; yet it is arguably not out of character for Odysseus, a person "addicted to deceit," to keep spinning his lies even when they seem to serve no particular purpose.

Perhaps there are two related reasons that many readers have felt unsatisfied with the ending of [The Odyssey.]{.italic} First, it feels less than definitive as a place to stop the story. More events will clearly happen after this conflict between the Ithacans and Odysseus, which is stopped only thanks to the convenient intervention of the goddess. Moreover, a curtailed battle does not feel like the proper culmination of a story of homecoming---unless Odysseus feels most at home when he is killing his fellow countrymen.

Both of these "problems" are perhaps precisely the point. The poem refuses to offer us a definitive moment at which home and peace are achieved, once and for all. Odysseus never sets aside his desire to fight and kill his fellow men, or his yearning to wander and be absent. According to the prophecy given by the dead spirit of the prophet Tiresias in Book 11, Odysseus will not remain and settle in Ithaca. He has at least one more journey to complete, to a land that is, from the perspective of the Greek islands, the strangest of all: where nobody knows the sea, where people eat food without salt, and nobody has even seen a boat. He will know he has arrived when he meets "someone who calls the object on my back / a winnowing fan" (a tool used in preindustrial agriculture to separate wheat from chaff). Only in this utterly alien location, Tiresias suggests, can Odysseus finally put to rest the anger of Poseidon, the Lord of the Sea.

But even if he were ever to return from this obviously mythical location, one might wonder whether Odysseus would be able to settle down in peace and comfort in Ithaca---the land that would still be populated by the families of those Odysseus has killed. In antiquity, there were a number of legends about what happened to the protagonist after the poem ends---alternatives that may reflect ancient recognition of how little the last book wraps things up. One story tells that this criminally aggressive hero was sent into exile for killing the suitors. Other ancient stories express discomfort with Odysseus' habit of committing adultery. We are told that he had a son by Circe, named Telegonus, who sailed in search of him and eventually killed him with a poisoned spear. Several stories provide alternative futures for Penelope: either she was killed by Odysseus himself for sleeping with Antinous the suitor; or, creepily, she married Odysseus' son Telegonus; or she was spirited to Arcadia and seduced by the god Hermes, and became the mother of the god Pan. All of these stories seem to suggest dissatisfaction with the state of Odysseus and Penelope's marriage, which is defined in the poem primarily by absence, pain, economic dependence, and mutual mistrust.

[The Odyssey]{.italic} is in some ways like a fairy tale. "Bad" people are killed, and the "good" hero triumphs. But the poem is surprisingly clear-sighted about both the problematic tendencies of its own hero and its own dominant fantasy. Everybody likes the idea of a radical reversal of fortune, a surprising and long-delayed final victory, a settled, forever home. This is a text that allows us to explore our desire for power and for permanence, in the world of imagination, while also showing us the darker side of these deep human dreams, hopes, and fears.

[Reception]{.calibre1}

In antiquity, Homer was traditionally said to have been a blind man from the Greek island of Chios. This popular idea is expressed in a poem from the sixth century BCE called the "Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo," which tells how Apollo and his twin sister, Artemis, were born. Their mother, Leto, was pregnant with the twins by Zeus, and had to find a place to give birth: a hard task, since Zeus' jealous wife, Hera, had made all lands on earth reject her. Finally Leto reached Delos, which was supposedly a floating island, unattached to the sea floor. Since this was a space unattached to the earth, the island welcomed the laboring goddess. Delos was rewarded with a special sanctuary to the god Apollo, who felt deep attachment to the island as the place of his birth. The poem ends by instructing the girls who worship Apollo on Delos to remember the poet who composed the present song:

> [Bless me, Apollo, bless me, Artemis;]{.italic}

> [and greetings, all you girls! Remember me]{.italic}

> [whenever any poor and homeless stranger]{.italic}

> [comes here and asks you, "Girls, who is to you]{.italic}

> [the sweetest of all singers? Which one gives you]{.italic}

> [most pleasure?" All of you must answer him,]{.italic}

> ["He is a blind man and he makes his home]{.italic}

> [in rocky Chios; all his songs will be]{.italic}

> [the best forever."]{.italic}

The historian Thucydides, writing in the late fifth century BCE, confidently quotes the passage as evidence that Homer was a blind man from Chios. Often seen as the father of modern or "scientific" historiography, Thucydides prides himself on his skeptical attitude towards implausible traditional myths. But it is extremely unlikely that the person who composed these lines had any hand in creating the Homeric epics. The hymn was probably composed by a member of a family or professional organization who lived on Chios in the sixth century, calling themselves the Homeridae---the children of Homer. These people gave performances of [The Iliad]{.italic} and [Odyssey]{.italic} (or portions from them) and also created their own poetic compositions, which they presented as also "Homeric." This particular hymn may have been composed by an active member of this clan to honor an unusual double festival to Apollo of Delos and Delphi in 522 BCE---far later than the composition of the Homeric poems themselves.

The testimony about the "blind man from Chios," then, does not tell us anything about the composition of [The Iliad]{.italic} and [Odyssey]{.italic} themselves---which probably originated a good two hundred years earlier. But the "Homeric Hymn" does bring into sharp relief the fact that already in archaic, preclassical Greece, the Homeric poems had a place at the absolute top of the poetic canon: they were the "sweetest," the "best forever." Moreover, the notion that "Homer" is a poet who celebrates a birth on a floating island may express an awareness that these poems had evolved out of a long oral history, from multiple different local traditions. Homer, like the god of poetry, emerges from an ambiguous or floating origin. Everybody in the Greek-speaking world wanted to claim and remake Homer for themselves---a process that continues to this day.

[The Odyssey]{.italic} was, along with [The Iliad]{.italic}, the foundation of Greek and Roman elite education. Sections from the poems were also performed by rhapsodes to adults, for entertainment. All upper-class men in the Graeco-Roman world knew the Homeric poems well. Aeschylus is said to have called his tragedies "slices from the banquet of Homer." Homer (and the rest of the archaic epic tradition) provided the basis for much of classical literature: tragedy, but also history, later forms of epic, pastoral, and the novel.

But Greek and Roman writers often struggled with the legacy of Homer. Plato's character Socrates in the [Republic]{.italic} famously insists that Homer, along with the Athenian tragedians, must be excluded from the ideal city, because his work provides a false image of reality, and stirs up emotions that are better repressed and controlled. Plato and others criticized the depiction of the gods in the poems, for their lack of morality. Odysseus himself is often a problematic character in later Greek and Roman literature, characterized by his abuse of cleverness for self-interested goals. In Sophocles' [Ajax,]{.italic} he is a commonsensical realist, but in the same author's [Philoctetes,]{.italic} as well as in Euripides' [Hecuba]{.italic}, he is a scheming sophist, willing to say or do anything (including murder children) in order to achieve his own military ends. In Virgil's [Aeneid]{.italic}, Odysseus becomes "cruel Odysseus," the unscrupulous destroyer of Troy, which was the home of the poem's hero. But Aeneas himself becomes a new kind of Odysseus, in his search for a home that exists only in the future: the city of Rome itself.

The canonical status of Homer, combined with the philosophical and ethical challenges involved in treating these poems as a source of "truth," led to a tradition of allegorizing the various adventures of Odysseus. We have, for example, an extensive Neoplatonic interpretation by Porphyry (third century CE) of the episode in Book 13 when Odysseus reaches Ithaca and comes to the cave of the Nymphs. Porphyry notes the fact that there is apparently no such cave on Ithaca, and that the details of the description are extremely implausible. The passage must therefore, he suggests, be read as an extended metaphor for the soul's place inside the material, terrestrial world.

[The Odyssey]{.italic} continued to be read and studied, alongside [The Iliad]{.italic}, throughout classical antiquity. But knowledge of Greek became extremely rare in the Western world after the fall of the western Roman Empire, in the fifth century CE. Dante had no access to the original [Odyssey,]{.italic} though he knew the story of Odysseus. In his [Inferno]{.italic}, he places Ulysses (the Romanized name for Odysseus) low down in Hell (the eighth circle out of nine, the circle of Fraud), because he leads his people by deceit into destruction. Dante's silver-tongued, self-serving, and falsely inspiring Ulysses gives his men a rousing, deceitful speech urging them to continue their adventures for "virtue and knowledge"; he is urging them on, yet again, to shipwreck, on the Mountain of Purgatory. This rhetorically gifted version of Odysseus is not entirely alien to the character we meet in Homer.

Texts of Homer were preserved in Arabic translation and in the Byzantine (eastern) Empire. We still have hundreds of important Homeric manuscripts from the eastern empire, dating from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries CE. When Byzantium fell in 1453, refugees from Constantinople brought their knowledge of Greek with them to Italy. The Italian humanists of the fifteenth century learned Greek, read Homer, and began to spread their knowledge through Europe, by means of printed editions and translations of the Homeric poems. The poems were translated first into Latin, and then into all the vernacular languages of Europe.

The first complete [Odyssey]{.italic} in English was that of George Chapman, in 1615. Chapman's [Odyssey]{.italic}, in rhyming pentameter couplets, presents the hero as a true soldier and gentleman, a proto-Christian and proto-Stoic whose greatest virtue is his ability to endure suffering and control his impulses. But not everybody in seventeenth-century England was so optimistic about the possibility of claiming Odysseus as a Christian hero. In John Milton's [Paradise Lost]{.italic} (1667), Odysseus' clever, deceptively inspiring rhetoric and tendency to get lost on a long journey to a homeland from which he has been excluded by divine power are now the characteristics of Satan---the epic antihero who shows us what is wrong with classical notions of heroism from Milton's perspective.

In the eighteenth century, Alexander Pope, along with a team of collaborators, produced translations of [The Iliad]{.italic} and [The Odyssey]{.italic} that dominated the market and transformed interpretation of the poems for several generations to come. Pope makes [The Odyssey]{.italic} into a text about those essentially eighteenth-century preoccupations: proper manners and good government. In Pope's version, Odysseus is the ultimate hero of politeness and tact, the man who always has the appropriate response to every social challenge. He is also a just monarch, whose knowledge of suffering informs his exertion of power over the "nations" whom he governs.

John Keats, who knew no Greek, wrote "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer" in 1816; the appeal of Chapman, imagined in the sonnet like the discovery of the New World, comes partly from the fact that Chapman offered a glimpse of a Homer that was different from the familiar, normalized Homer of Pope. Dipping into Chapman's Homer makes him feel like an astronomer, "when a new planet swims into his ken." As we have seen, scholars in the nineteenth and then twentieth century discovered "new" versions of Homer by searching for the real places that might lie behind the texts, and also by reconstructing the conditions in which these poems were created. But [The Odyssey]{.italic} could also be used as a way of thinking about what might be old and worn out in the Western cultural tradition. Tennyson's "Ulysses" imagines the protagonist as a weary but compulsive imperial explorer, whose restless boredom makes it impossible for him ever to settle at home: he insists on pushing onward to the western stars, "made weak by time and fate, but strong in will / To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."

The stubborn persistence of interest in [The Odyssey]{.italic} in modern times makes it impossible to mention more than a tiny fraction of the adaptations that it has inspired. New versions of Odysseus' story were created in the literary world, perhaps most famously by James Joyce in [Ulysses]{.italic} (1922), which uses the book structure of [The Odyssey]{.italic} for a stylistically virtuosic narrative of one ordinary man's day wandering around Dublin before returning to his wife. In [Omeros]{.italic} (1990), Derek Walcott used some of the characters from [The Odyssey]{.italic} as the basis for his poetic account of life on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. [The Odyssey]{.italic} has been adapted numerous times in film, television, comic books, music, and visual art, as well as in poetry and novels.

Children often encounter stories from [The Odyssey]{.italic} as their first exposure to ancient Greek culture. [The Odyssey]{.italic} is also often used in college literature classes, as the starting point for studying Western or world literature. It is a poem that has the power to speak to people from many different social backgrounds in the contemporary Anglo-American world. Reading [The Odyssey]{.italic} with fresh, curious, and critical eyes may help us not only rethink our assumptions about people in the past, but also break down some of our modern distinctions and assumptions. Odysseus is a migrant, but he is also a political and military leader, a strategist, a poet, a loving husband and father, an adulterer, a homeless person, an athlete, a disabled cripple, a soldier with a traumatic past, a pirate, thief and liar, a fugitive, a colonial invader, a home owner, a sailor, a construction worker, a mass murderer, and a war hero. Immersing ourselves in his story, and considering how these categories can exist in the same imaginative space, may help us reconsider both the origins of Western literature, and our infinitely complex contemporary world.

[[TRANSLATOR'S NOTE]{.calibre2}](#index_split_005.html_filepos1728)

When I was eight years old, my primary school put on a production of a (much-shortened) [Odyssey,]{.italic} complete with costumes, song, and dance. The play starred the cute troublemaker in my class as Odysseus, the headmaster of the school as Polyphemus (the one-eyed monster outwitted by his tiny opponents), and me in pigtails as the goddess Athena.

It was a turning point in my life. I was enthralled by the production, not only because we could pretend to gouge out the headmaster's eye (thrilling though that was), or just because I was cast to play a goddess (ditto), but because of the story and the atmosphere it evoked: a world of magic and adventure, of diverse cultures (both human and nonhuman, welcoming and murderous, foreign and familiar), and of an individual's struggle to survive and return home. After this experience, I was inspired to read as many Greek myths as I could find, including versions of [The Odyssey]{.italic} itself. I went on to learn Latin and Greek, to read classics at Oxford, and to become a professional classicist. Over the decades since my eight-year-old performance, [The Odyssey]{.italic} has always been with me.

In planning to translate the poem into English, my first thoughts were of style. The original is written in a highly rhythmical form of verse. It reads nothing like prose and nothing like any spoken or nonpoetic kinds of discourse. Many modern poets in the Anglo-American tradition write free verse, and modern British and American readers are not usually accustomed to reading long narratives with a regular metrical beat, except for earlier literature like Shakespeare. Most contemporary translators of Homer have not attempted to create anything like a regular line beat, though they often lay out their text as if it were verse. But [The Odyssey]{.italic} is a poem, and it needs to have a predictable and distinctive rhythm that can be easily heard when the text is read out loud. The original is in six-footed lines (dactylic hexameters), the conventional meter for archaic Greek narrative verse. I used iambic pentameter, because it is the conventional meter for regular English narrative verse---the rhythm of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, Keats, and plenty of more recent anglophone poets. I have spent many hours reading aloud, both the Greek original and my own work in progress. Homer's music is quite different from mine, but my translation sings to its own regular and distinctive beat.

My version is the same length as the original, with exactly the same number of lines. I chose to write within this difficult constraint because any translation without such limitations will tend to be longer than the original, and I wanted a narrative pace that could match its stride to Homer's nimble gallop. Moreover, in reading the original, one is constantly aware of the rhythms and the units that make up elements of every line, as well as of the ongoing movement of the narrative---like a large, elaborate piece of embroidery made of tiny, still visible stitches. I wanted my translation to mark its own nature as a web of poetic language, with a sentence structure that is, like that of Homer, audibly built up out of smaller units of sense. There is often a notion, especially in the Anglo-American world, that a translation is good insofar as it disguises its own existence as a translation; translations are praised for being "natural." I hope that my translation is readable and fluent, but that its literary artifice is clearly apparent.

Matthew Arnold famously claimed that translators of Homer must convey four supposedly essential qualities of Homeric style: plainness, simplicity, directness of thought, and nobility. But Homeric style is actually quite often redundant and very often repetitious---not particularly simple or direct. Homer is also very often not "noble": the language is not colloquial, and it avoids obscenity, but it is not bombastic or grandiloquent. The notion that Homeric epic must be rendered in grand, ornate, rhetorically elevated English has been with us since the time of Alexander Pope. It is past time, I believe, to reject this assumption. Homer's language is markedly rhythmical, but it is not difficult or ostentatious. [The Odyssey]{.italic} relies on coordinated, not subordinated syntax ("and then this, and then this, and then this," rather than "although this, because of that, when this, which was this, on account of that"). I have frequently aimed for a certain level of simplicity, often using fairly ordinary, straightforward, and readable English. In using language that is largely simple, my goal is not to make Homer sound "primitive," but to mark the fact that stylistic pomposity is entirely un-Homeric. I also hope to invite readers to respond more actively with the text. Impressive displays of rhetoric and linguistic force are a good way to seem important and invite a particular kind of admiration, but they tend to silence dissent and discourage deeper modes of engagement. A consistently elevated style can make it harder for readers to keep track of what is at stake in the story. My translation is, I hope, recognizable as an epic poem, but it is one that avoids trumpeting its own status with bright, noisy linguistic fireworks, in order to invite a more thoughtful consideration of what the narrative means, and the ways it matters.

I have also tried to break up the plainness with phrases and passages in quite different registers. Sometimes the metaphors and similes are surprising, as when the women of Phaeacia work the wool "with fingers quick as rustling poplar leaves." I echo the oddness of Homeric color terms (with terms such as "purple" waves), and the Homeric eye for things that sparkle (like dancing boys, whose legs were "bright with speed"). Sometimes there are slightly strange phrases or metaphors which have their own kind of resonance---as when Odysseus, having survived shipwreck, hides under a pile of leaves, and is compared to a glowing torch, used by a farmer in the outback "to save the seed of fire and keep a source."

The formulaic elements in Homer, especially the repeated epithets, pose a particular challenge. The epithets applied to Dawn, Athena, Hermes, Zeus, Penelope, Telemachus, Odysseus, and the suitors repeat over and over in the original. But in my version, I have chosen deliberately to interpret these epithets in several different ways, depending on the demands of the scene at hand. I do not want to deceive the unsuspecting reader about the nature of the original poem; rather, I hope to be truthful about my own text---its relationships with its readers and with the original. In an oral or semiliterate culture, repeated epithets give a listener an anchor in a quick-moving story. In a highly literate society such as our own, repetitions are likely to feel like moments to skip. They can be a mark of writerly laziness or unwillingness to acknowledge one's own interpretative position, and can send a reader to sleep. I have used the opportunity offered by the repetitions to explore the multiple different connotations of each epithet. The enduring Odysseus can be a "veteran" or "resilient" or "stoical," while the wily Odysseus can be a "trickster" or speak "deceitfully," depending on the needs of a particular passage. I have tried to bring out the beauty in the formulaic scenes that repeat, as normalized cultural practices, actions that will be alien to every modern reader---as when the people of Pylos are sacrificing "black bulls for blue Poseidon, Lord of Earthquakes," or in the many moments when black ships, equipped with oars and sails, travel across the water from one island to another: "A fair wind whistled and our ships sped on / across the journey-ways of fish."

I hope there is in my translation, as in the original, a wide range of stylistic registers. There are descriptive passages that should combine the simple with the sublime, as in the evocation of Mount Olympus, the home of the gods:

> [The place is never shaken by the wind,]{.italic}

> [or wet with rain or blanketed by snow.]{.italic}

> [A cloudless sky is spread above the mountain,]{.italic}

> [white radiance all round. The blessed gods]{.italic}

> [live there in happiness forevermore.]{.italic}
> [ (6:42--46)]{.calibre4}

In Homer, there is something marvelous not only in descriptions of the gods, but even in the most ordinary experiences, like spending a warm summer night outside, "surrounded by the rustling of the porch," or when Queen Arete of Phaeacia is sitting at home working the wool with her women, and we are told that she "sat beside the hearth and spun / sea-purpled yarn." There are moments that are strange and beautiful at the same time, as when Menelaus has to hide among the smelly seals to wait for the old Sea God Proteus:

> [Around him sleep the clustering seals, the daughters]{.italic}

> [of lovely Lady Brine. Their breath smells sour]{.italic}

> [from gray seawater, pungent salty depths.]{.italic}
> [ (4.402--4)]{.calibre4}

Sometimes there is a horrible, paradoxical kind of beauty to be found even in moments of terrible violence---as when Odysseus looks round his hall at the corpses of the boys whom he has slaughtered:

> [He saw them fallen, all of them, so many,]{.italic}

> [lying in blood and dust, like fish hauled up]{.italic}

> [out of the dark-gray sea in fine-mesh nets. . . .]{.italic}

> [The sun shines down and takes their life away.]{.italic}
> [ (22.383--88)]{.calibre4}

Other moments should arouse a sense of curiosity or excitement or horror or comedy. I wanted to bring out the particular ways in which Homer can be funny---in, for example, Nausicaa's obvious, supposedly concealed desire for Odysseus ("I hope I get a man like this as husband," she innocently remarks), or in Athena's almost convincing role-playing as a little girl:

> [Divine Athena winked at him and said,]{.italic}

> ["Here, Mr. Foreigner, this is the house."]{.italic}
> [ (7.47--48)]{.calibre4}

Simple language sometimes helps convey simple but intense, consuming feelings---as when Odysseus says, "I miss my family. I have been gone / so long it hurts." Simplicity of diction can also make clear feelings that are far from simple---as in the scene when Penelope and Odysseus meet for the first time after he kills her suitors, when she has not yet recognized him as her husband:

> > > [He sat beside the pillar,]{.italic}

> [and kept his eyes down, waiting to find out]{.italic}

> [whether the woman who once shared his bed]{.italic}

> [would speak to him. She sat in silence, stunned.]{.italic}
> [ (23.90--93)]{.calibre4}

I have tried to make sure that a reader can feel inside the characters in the poem, to convey the ways that each character in the poem has her or his own distinctive point of view---the immaturity and vulnerability of Telemachus, for example, when he tries to speak out against the suitors, but ends up bursting into tears: "He stopped, frustrated, flung the scepter down / and burst out crying." I hope readers can see each character, even the minor ones, as people with a rounded, complete perspective on their lives. For instance, in my version of the hanging of the slave women, I aim to invite genuine empathy rather than an objectifying thrill; while other translators call their death "piteous" or "pitiful," in my version we glimpse their pain, not the feelings of a spectator: it is "an agony"---"They gasped / feet twitching for a while, but not for long."

It is traditional in statements like this Translator's Note to bewail one's own inadequacy when trying to be faithful to the original. Like many contemporary translation theorists, I believe that we need to rethink the terms in which we talk about translation. My translation is, like all translations, an entirely different text from the original poem. Translation always, necessarily, involves interpretation; there is no such thing as a translation that provides anything like a transparent window through which a reader can see the original. The gendered metaphor of the "faithful" translation, whose worth is always secondary to that of a male-authored original, acquires a particular edge in the context of a translation by a woman of [The Odyssey,]{.italic} a poem that is deeply invested in female fidelity and male dominance. I have taken very seriously the task of understanding the language of the original text as deeply as I can, and working through what Homer may have meant in archaic and classical Greece. I have also taken seriously the task of creating a new and coherent English text, which conveys something of that understanding but operates within an entirely different cultural context. The Homeric text grows inside my translation, like Athena's olive tree inside the bed made by Odysseus, "with delicate long leaves, full-grown and green, / as sturdy as a pillar."

My translation is written in a style that echoes the rhythms and phrases of contemporary anglophone speech. It may be tempting to imagine that a translation of a very ancient poem would be somehow better if it used the language of an earlier era. Mild stylistic archaism is often accepted without question in translations of ancient texts and can be presented as if it were a mark of authenticity. But of course, the English of the nineteenth or early twentieth century is no closer to Homeric Greek than the language of today. The use of a noncolloquial or archaizing linguistic register can blind readers to the real, inevitable, and vast gap between the Greek original and any modern translation. My use of contemporary language---rather than the English of a generation or two ago---is meant to remind readers that this text can engage us in a direct way, and also that it is genuinely ancient. My Homer does not speak in your grandparents' English, since that language is no closer to the wine-dark sea than your own. I have tried to keep to a register that is recognizably speakable and readable, while skirting between the Charybdis of artifice and the Scylla of slang.

All modern translations of ancient texts exist in a time, a place, and a language that are entirely alien from those of the original. All modern translations are equally modern. The question facing translators and their readers is whether to try to disguise this fact, through stylistic tricks such as archaism and an elevated, artificially "literary" register, or to underline it, and thereby encourage readers to be aware that the text exists in two different temporal and spatial moments at once. I have tried to make my translation sound markedly poetic and sometimes linguistically distinctive, even odd. But I have also aimed for a fresh and contemporary register. The shock of encountering an ancient author speaking in largely recognizable language can make him seem more strange, and newly strange. I would like to invite readers to experience a sense of connection to this ancient text, while also recognizing its vast distance from our own place and time. Homer is, and is not, our contemporary.

A translator has a responsibility to acknowledge her own agency and to wrestle, in explicit and conscious ways, not only with the multiple meanings of the original in its own culture but also with what her own text may mean, and the effects it may have on its readers. Because [The Odyssey]{.italic} has become such a foundational text in our educational system and in our imagination of Western history, I believe it is particularly important for the translator to think through and tease out its values, and to allow the reader to see the cracks and fissures in its constructed fantasy. I see this process not as a denial or abandonment of the original text, but as a way to pay deep attention to the original, most especially in the moments when it may contradict itself.

For example, [The Odyssey]{.italic} is a poem that may seem to normalize or valorize the treatment of non-Western people as monsters. I have made clear, especially in my version of the Polyphemus episode, that this is not entirely true: the text allows for a certain amount of sympathy and even admiration for this maimed non-Greek person. Unlike many modern translators, I have avoided describing the Cyclops with words such as "savage," which carry with them the legacy of early modern and modern forms of colonialism---a legacy that is, of course, anachronistic in the world of [The Odyssey]{.italic}.

The elite households represented in [The Odyssey]{.italic} all include a large staff of domestic slaves to work in the house, preparing and serving food and taking care of their masters' clothes, and field slaves to work the estate and tend the animals. The language used to describe these people poses a particular challenge to the translator. To translate a domestic female slave, called in the original a [dmoe]{.italic} ("female-house-slave"), as a "maid" or "domestic servant" would imply that she was free. I have often used "slave," although it is less specific than many of the terms for types of slaves in the original. The need to acknowledge the fact and the horror of slavery, and to mark the fact that the idealized society depicted in the poem is one where slavery is shockingly taken for granted, seems to me to outweigh the need to specify, in every instance, the type of slave. I have also used the terms "house girl" and "house boy." The analogy with a slave-owning plantation in the antebellum American South is certainly not exact, but it is at least a little closer than the alternative analogies---of a Victorian stately home or a modern nightclub.

I try to avoid importing contemporary types of sexism into this ancient poem, instead shining a clear light on the particular forms of sexism and patriarchy that do exist in the text, which are only partly familiar from our world. For instance, in the scene where Telemachus oversees the hanging of the slaves who have been sleeping with the suitors, most translations introduce derogatory language ("sluts" or "whores"), suggesting that these women are being punished for a genuinely objectionable pattern of behavior, as if their sexual history actually justified their deaths. The original Greek does not label these slaves with any derogatory language. Many contemporary translators render Helen's "dog-face" as if it were equivalent to "shameless Helen" (or "Helen the bitch"). I have kept the metaphor ("hounded"), and have also made sure that my Helen, like that of the original, refrains from blaming herself for what men have done in her name.

In the difficult case of Penelope, I have tried to maintain what I see as the most important feature of her characterization, which is opacity. But I have also done my best to bring out her pain, her courage, her intelligence, and her strength. One important tiny detail will illustrate some of the challenges involved in the depiction of Penelope, as well as suggest the kind of linguistic challenges with which I have wrestled throughout the poem. It comes at the start of Book 21, when Penelope goes to the storeroom to fetch the bow and axes and initiate the contest. Whether or not she has recognized her husband at this point, and whatever her motives in setting up the contest, her action of picking up the key in the door of the weaponry is momentous and consequential: it is what enables the whole denouement of the poem. Milton echoes this episode in [Paradise Lost]{.italic}, when Sin turns the "fatal key" of Hell, to enable Satan to ascend and invade Earth. Homer describes Penelope's hand at this moment with the epithet [pachus]{.italic}, which means "thick." It is often used elsewhere in Homer to describe hands, but always, in other contexts, the hands of male warriors; Penelope is the only woman whose hand is "thick." There is a problem here, since in our culture, women are not supposed to have big, thick, or fat hands---and yet Penelope is clearly being presented in a positive light. Translators have tended to normalize the text by skipping the epithet, or by substituting the kind of word one might expect ("steady hand"). But the use of an epithet in an exceptional way signals the uniqueness and importance of this action. To call her hand "clenched," "swollen," or "fumbling" would risk suggesting that she might be incompetent, which is clearly not the point of the passage. A "heavy" hand might suggest that Penelope is reluctant to open the storeroom (as if she might also have a heavy heart); this would be a confusing signal to send, given that she proposed the contest herself. "Strong" seems too neutral, and not thick enough. So I used "muscular":

> > > > [Her muscular, firm hand]{.italic}

> [picked up the ivory handle of the key.]{.italic}
> [ (21.7--8)]{.calibre4}

Weaving does in fact make a person's hands more muscular. I wanted to ensure that my translation, like the original, underlines Penelope's physical competence, which marks her as a character who plays a crucial part in the action---whether or not she knows what she is doing.

Throughout my work on this translation, I have thought hard about my different responsibilities: to the original text; to my readers; to the need to make sense; to the urge to question everything; to fiction, myth, and truth; to the demands of rhythm and the rumble of sound; to the feet that need to step in five carefully trotting paces, and the story that needs to canter on its way. I have been aware, constantly, of gaps and impossibilities in providing escort to Homer from archaic Greece to the contemporary anglophone world, as I have woven, unwoven, and woven up again the fabric of this complex web.

[The Odyssey]{.italic} is a very ancient and very foreign text, although its long-standing prominence in Anglo-American and European cultures may mask its strangeness. Homer's concerns---with loyalty, families, migrants, consumerism, violence, war, poverty, identity, rhetoric, and lies---are in many ways deeply familiar, but we see them here in unfamiliar guises. The poem is concerned, above all, with the duties and dangers involved in welcoming foreigners into one's home. I hope my translation will enable contemporary readers to welcome and host this foreign poem, with all the right degrees of warmth, curiosity, openness, and suspicion.

There is a stranger outside your house. He is old, ragged, and dirty. He is tired. He has been wandering, homeless, for a long time, perhaps many years. Invite him inside. You do not know his name. He may be a thief. He may be a murderer. He may be a god. He may remind you of your husband, your father, or yourself. Do not ask questions. Wait. Let him sit on a comfortable chair and warm himself beside your fire. Bring him some food, the best you have, and a cup of wine. Let him eat and drink until he is satisfied. Be patient. When he is finished, he will tell his story. Listen carefully. It may not be as you expect.

[[The Boy and the Goddess]{.calibre6}](#index_split_005.html_filepos2497)

> Tell me about a complicated man.

> Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost

> when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy,

> and where he went, and who he met, the pain

> he suffered in the storms at sea, and how

> he worked to save his life and bring his men

> back home. He failed to keep them safe; poor fools,

> they ate the Sun God's cattle, and the god

> kept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus,

> tell the old story for our modern times.[ 10]{.calibre4}

> Find the beginning.

> > > > > All the other Greeks

> who had survived the brutal sack of Troy

> sailed safely home to their own wives---except

> this man alone. Calypso, a great goddess,

> had trapped him in her cave; she wanted him

> to be her husband. When the year rolled round

> in which the gods decreed he should go home

> to Ithaca, his troubles still went on.

> The man was friendless. All the gods took pity,

> except Poseidon's anger never ended[ 20]{.calibre4}

> until Odysseus was back at home.

> But now the distant Ethiopians,

> who live between the sunset and the dawn,

> were worshipping the Sea God with a feast,

> a hundred cattle and a hundred rams.

> There sat the god, delighting in his banquet.

> The other gods were gathered on Olympus,

> in Father Zeus' palace. He was thinking

> of fine, well-born Aegisthus, who was killed

> by Agamemnon's famous son Orestes.[ 30]{.calibre4}

> He told the deathless gods,

> > > > > > "This is absurd,

> that mortals blame the gods! They say we cause

> their suffering, but they themselves increase it

> by folly. So Aegisthus overstepped:

> he took the legal wife of Agamemnon,

> then killed the husband when he came back home,

> although he knew that it would doom them all.

> We gods had warned Aegisthus; we sent down

> perceptive Hermes, who flashed into sight

> and told him not to murder Agamemnon [ 40]{.calibre4}

> or court his wife, Orestes would grow up

> and come back to his home to take revenge.

> Aegisthus would not hear that good advice.

> But now his death has paid all debts."

> > > > > > Athena

> looked at him steadily and answered, "Father,

> he did deserve to die. Bring death to all

> who act like him! But I am agonizing

> about Odysseus and his bad luck.

> For too long he has suffered, with no friends,

> sea all around him, sea on every side,[ 50]{.calibre4}

> out on an island where a goddess lives,

> daughter of fearful Atlas, who holds up

> the pillars of the sea, and knows its depths---

> those pillars keep the heaven and earth apart.

> His daughter holds that poor unhappy man,

> and tries beguiling him with gentle words

> to cease all thoughts of Ithaca; but he

> longs to see even just the smoke that rises

> from his own homeland, and he wants to die.

> You do not even care, Olympian\![ 60]{.calibre4}

> Remember how he sacrificed to you

> on the broad plain of Troy beside his ships?

> So why do you dismiss Odysseus?"

> "Daughter!" the Cloud God said, "You must be joking,

> since how could I forget Odysseus?

> He is more sensible than other humans,

> and makes more sacrifices to the gods.

> But Lord Poseidon rages, unrelenting,

> because Odysseus destroyed the eye

> of godlike Polyphemus, his own son,[ 70]{.calibre4}

> the strongest of the Cyclopes---whose mother,

> Thoösa, is a sea-nymph, child of Phorcys,

> the sea king; and she lay beside Poseidon

> inside a hollow cave. So now Poseidon

> prevents Odysseus from reaching home

> but does not kill him. Come then, we must plan:

> how can he get back home? Poseidon must

> give up his anger, since he cannot fight

> alone against the will of all the gods."

> Athena's eyes lit up and she replied,[ 80]{.calibre4}

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> "Great Father, if the blessed gods at last

> will let Odysseus return back home,

> then hurry, we must send our messenger,

> Hermes the giant-slayer. He must swoop

> down to Ogygia right away and tell

> the beautiful Calypso we have formed

> a firm decision that Odysseus

> has waited long enough. He must go home.

> And I will go to Ithaca to rouse

> the courage of his son, and make him call[ 90]{.calibre4}

> a meeting, and speak out against the suitors

> who kill his flocks of sheep and longhorn cattle

> unstoppably. Then I will send him off

> to Pylos and to Sparta, to seek news

> about his father's journey home, and gain

> a noble reputation for himself."

> With that, she tied her sandals on her feet,

> the marvelous golden sandals that she wears

> to travel sea and land, as fast as wind.

> She took the heavy bronze-tipped spear she uses[ 100]{.calibre4}

> to tame the ranks of warriors with whom

> she is enraged. Then from the mountain down

> she sped to Ithaca, and stopped outside

> Odysseus' court, bronze spear in hand.

> She looked like Mentes now, the Taphian leader,

> a guest-friend. There she found the lordly suitors

> sitting on hides---they killed the cows themselves---

> and playing checkers. Quick, attentive house slaves

> were waiting on them. Some were mixing wine

> with water in the bowls, and others brought[ 110]{.calibre4}

> the tables out and wiped them off with sponges,

> and others carved up heaping plates of meat.

> Telemachus was sitting with them, feeling

> dejected. In his mind he saw his father

> coming from somewhere, scattering the suitors,

> and gaining back his honor, and control

> of all his property. With this in mind,

> he was the first to see Athena there.

> He disapproved of leaving strangers stranded,

> so he went straight to meet her at the gate,[ 120]{.calibre4}

> and shook her hand, and took her spear of bronze,

> and let his words fly out to her.

> > > > > > "Good evening,

> stranger, and welcome. Be our guest, come share

> our dinner, and then tell us what you need."

> He led her in, and Pallas followed him.

> Inside the high-roofed hall, he set her spear

> beside a pillar in a polished stand,

> in which Odysseus kept stores of weapons.

> And then he led her to a chair and spread

> a smooth embroidered cloth across the seat,[ 130]{.calibre4}

> and pulled a footstool up to it. He sat

> beside her on a chair of inlaid wood,

> a distance from the suitors, so their shouting

> would not upset the stranger during dinner;

> also to ask about his absent father.

> A girl brought washing water in a jug

> of gold, and poured it on their hands and into

> a silver bowl, and set a table by them.

> A deferential slave brought bread and laid

> a wide array of food, a generous spread.[ 140]{.calibre4}

> The carver set beside them plates of meat

> of every kind, and gave them golden cups.

> The cup boy kept on topping up the wine.

> The suitors sauntered in and sat on chairs,

> observing proper order, and the slaves

> poured water on their hands. The house girls brought

> baskets of bread and heaped it up beside them,

> and house boys filled their wine-bowls up with drink.

> They reached to take the good things set before them.

> Once they were satisfied with food and drink,[ 150]{.calibre4}

> the suitors turned their minds to other things---

> singing and dancing, glories of the feast.

> A slave brought out a well-tuned lyre and gave it

> to Phemius, the man the suitors forced

> to sing for them. He struck the chords to start

> his lovely song.

> > > > Telemachus leaned in

> close to Athena, so they would not hear,

> and said,

> > > "Dear guest---excuse my saying this---

> these men are only interested in music---

> a life of ease. They make no contribution.[ 160]{.calibre4}

> This food belongs to someone else, a man

> whose white bones may be lying in the rain

> or sunk beneath the waves. If they saw him

> return to Ithaca, they would all pray

> for faster feet, instead of wealth and gold

> and fancy clothes. In fact, he must have died.

> We have no hope. He will not come back home.

> If someone says so, we do not believe it.

> But come now, tell me this and tell the truth.

> Who are you? From what city, and what parents?[ 170]{.calibre4}

> What kind of ship did you here arrive on?

> What sailors brought you here, and by what route?

> You surely did not travel here on foot!

> Here is the thing I really want to know:

> have you been here before? Are you a friend

> who visited my father? Many men

> came to his house. He traveled many places."

> Athena's clear bright eyes met his. She said,

> "Yes, I will tell you everything. I am

> Mentes, the son of wise Anchialus,[ 180]{.calibre4}

> lord of the Taphians, who love the oar.

> I traveled with my ship and my companions

> over the wine-dark sea to foreign lands,

> with iron that I hope to trade for copper

> in Temese. My ship is in the harbor

> far from the town, beneath the woody hill.

> And you and I are guest-friends through our fathers,

> from long ago---Laertes can confirm it.

> I hear that fine old man no longer comes

> to town, but lives out in the countryside,[ 190]{.calibre4}

> stricken by grief, with only one old slave,

> who gives him food and drink when he trails back

> leg-weary from his orchard, rich in vines.

> I came because they told me that your father

> was here---but now it seems that gods have blocked

> his path back home. But I am sure that he

> is not yet dead. The wide sea keeps him trapped

> upon some island, captured by fierce men

> who will not let him go. Now I will make

> a prophecy the gods have given me,[ 200]{.calibre4}

> and I think it will all come true, although

> I am no prophet. He will not be gone

> much longer from his own dear native land,

> even if chains of iron hold him fast.

> He will devise a means of getting home.

> He is resourceful. Tell me now---are you

> Odysseus' son? You are so tall!

> Your handsome face and eyes resemble his.

> We often met and knew each other well,

> before he went to Troy, where all the best[ 210]{.calibre4}

> leaders of Argos sailed in hollow ships.

> From that time on, we have not seen each other."

> Telemachus was careful as he answered.

> "Dear guest, I will be frank with you. My mother

> says that I am his son, but I cannot

> be sure, since no one knows his own begetting.

> I wish I were the son of someone lucky,

> who could grow old at home with all his wealth.

> Instead, the most unlucky man alive

> is said to be my father---since you ask."[ 220]{.calibre4}

> Athena looked at him with sparkling eyes.

> "Son of Penelope, you and your sons

> will make a name in history, since you are

> so clever. But now tell me this. Who are

> these banqueters? And what is the occasion?

> A drinking party, or a wedding feast?

> They look so arrogant and self-indulgent,

> making themselves at home. A wise observer

> would surely disapprove of how they act."

> Telemachus said moodily, "My friend, [ 230]{.calibre4}

> since you have raised the subject, there was once

> a time when this house here was doing well,

> our future bright, when he was still at home.

> But now the gods have changed their plans and cursed us,

> and cast my father into utter darkness.

> If he had died it would not be this bad---

> if he had fallen with his friends at Troy,

> or in his loved ones' arms, when he had wound

> the threads of war to end. The Greeks would then

> have built a tomb for him; he would have won[ 240]{.calibre4}

> fame for his son. But now, the winds have seized him,

> and he is nameless and unknown. He left

> nothing but tears for me. I do not weep

> only for him. The gods have given me

> so many other troubles. All the chiefs

> of Same, Zacynthus, Dulichium,

> and local lords, from rocky Ithaca,

> are courting Mother, wasting our whole house.

> She does not turn these awful suitors down,

> nor can she end the courting. They keep eating,[ 250]{.calibre4}

> spoiling my house---and soon, they will kill me!"

> Athena said in outrage, "This is monstrous!

> You need Odysseus to come back home

> and lay his hands on all those shameless suitors!

> If only he would come here now and stand

> right at the gates, with two spears in his hands,

> in shield and helmet, as when I first saw him!

> Odysseus was visiting our house,

> drinking and having fun on his way back

> from sailing in swift ships to Ephyra [ 260]{.calibre4}

> to visit Ilus. He had gone there looking

> for deadly poison to anoint his arrows.

> Ilus refused, because he feared the gods.

> My father gave Odysseus the poison,

> loving him blindly. May Odysseus

> come meet the suitors with that urge to kill!

> A bitter courtship and short life for them!

> But whether he comes home to take revenge,

> or not, is with the gods. You must consider

> how best to drive these suitors from your house.[ 270]{.calibre4}

> Come, listen carefully to what I say.

> Tomorrow call the Achaean chiefs to meeting,

> and tell the suitors---let the gods be witness---

> 'All of you, go away! To your own homes!'

> As for your mother, if she wants to marry,

> let her return to her great father's home.

> They will make her a wedding and prepare

> abundant gifts to show her father's love.

> Now here is some advice from me for you.

> Fit out a ship with twenty oars, the best,[ 280]{.calibre4}

> and go find out about your long-lost father.

> Someone may tell you news, or you may hear

> a voice from Zeus, best source of information.

> First go to Pylos, question godlike Nestor;

> from there, to Sparta; visit Menelaus.

> He came home last of all the Achaean heroes.

> If you should hear that he is still alive

> and coming home, put up with this abuse

> for one more year. But if you hear that he

> is dead, go home, and build a tomb for him,[ 290]{.calibre4}

> and hold a lavish funeral to show

> the honor he deserves, and give your mother

> in marriage to a man. When this is done,

> consider deeply how you might be able

> to kill the suitors in your halls---by tricks

> or openly. You must not stick to childhood;

> you are no longer just a little boy.

> You surely heard how everybody praised

> Orestes when he killed the man who killed

> his famous father---devious Aegisthus? [ 300]{.calibre4}

> Dear boy, I see how big and tall you are.

> Be brave, and win yourself a lasting name.

> But I must go now, on my speedy ship;

> my friends are getting tired of waiting for me.

> Remember what I said and heed my words."

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> Telemachus was brooding on her words,

> and said, "Dear guest, you were so kind to give me

> this fatherly advice. I will remember.

> I know that you are eager to be off,

> but please enjoy a bath before you go,[ 310]{.calibre4}

> and take a gift with you. I want to give you

> a precious, pretty treasure as a keepsake

> to mark our special friendship."

> > > > > > But the goddess

> Athena met his gaze and said, "Do not

> hold me back now. I must be on my way.

> As for the gift you feel inspired to give me,

> save it for when I come on my way home

> and let me give you presents then as well

> in fair exchange."

> > > > > With that, the owl-eyed goddess

> flew away like a bird, up through the smoke.[ 320]{.calibre4}

> She left him feeling braver, more determined,

> and with his father even more in mind.

> Watching her go, he was amazed and saw

> she was a god. Then godlike, he went off

> to meet the suitors.

> > > > > They were sitting calmly,

> listening to the poet, who sang how

> Athena cursed the journey of the Greeks

> as they were sailing home from Troy. Upstairs,

> Penelope had heard the marvelous song.

> She clambered down the steep steps of her house,[ 330]{.calibre4}

> not by herself---two slave girls came with her.

> She reached the suitors looking like a goddess,

> then stopped and stood beside a sturdy pillar,

> holding a gauzy veil before her face.

> Her slave girls stood, one on each side of her.

> In tears, she told the holy singer,

> > > > > > "Stop,

> please Phemius! You know so many songs,

> enchanting tales of things that gods and men

> have done, the deeds that singers publicize.

> Sing something else, and let them drink in peace. [ 340]{.calibre4}

> Stop this upsetting song that always breaks

> my heart, so I can hardly bear my grief.

> I miss him all the time---that man, my husband,

> whose story is so famous throughout Greece."

> Sullen Telemachus said, "Mother, no,

> you must not criticize the loyal bard

> for singing as it pleases him to sing.

> Poets are not to blame for how things are;

> Zeus is; he gives to each as is his will.

> Do not blame Phemius because he told[ 350]{.calibre4}

> about the Greek disasters. You must know

> the newest song is always praised the most.

> So steel your heart and listen to the song.

> Odysseus was not the only one

> who did not come back home again from Troy.

> Many were lost. Go in and do your work.

> Stick to the loom and distaff. Tell your slaves

> to do their chores as well. It is for men

> to talk, especially me. I am the master."

> That startled her. She went back to her room,[ 360]{.calibre4}

> and took her son's uneasy words to heart.

> She went upstairs, along with both her slaves,

> and wept there for her dear Odysseus,

> until Athena gave her eyes sweet sleep.

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> Throughout the shadowy hall the suitors clamored,

> praying to lie beside her in her bed.

> Telemachus inhaled, then started speaking.

> "You suitors, you are taking this too far.

> Let us enjoy the feast in peace. It is

> a lovely thing to listen to a bard,[ 370]{.calibre4}

> especially one with such a godlike voice.

> At dawn, let us assemble in the square.

> I have to tell you this---it is an order.

> You have to leave my halls. Go dine elsewhere!

> Eat your own food, or share between your houses.

> Or if you think it easier and better

> to ruin one man's wealth, and if you think

> that you can get away with it---go on!

> I call upon the gods; Zeus will grant vengeance.

> You will be punished and destroyed, right here!"[ 380]{.calibre4}

> He spoke, and they began to bite their lips,

> shocked that Telemachus would dare to speak

> so boldly. But Antinous replied,

> "Telemachus, the gods themselves have taught you

> such pride, to talk so big and brash in public!

> May Zeus the son of Cronus never grant you

> your true inheritance, which is the throne

> of Ithaca."

> > > His mind alert and focused,

> Telemachus replied, "Antinous,

> you will not like this, but I have to say,[ 390]{.calibre4}

> I hope Zeus does give me the throne. Do you

> deny it is an honorable thing

> to be a king? It brings the household wealth,

> and honor to the man. But there are many

> other great chiefs in sea-girt Ithaca,

> both old and young. I know that. One of them

> may seize the throne, now that Odysseus

> has died. But I shall be at least the lord

> of my own house and of the slaves that he

> seized for my benefit."

> > > > > > Eurymachus[ 400]{.calibre4}

> replied, "Telemachus, the gods must choose

> which of us will be king of Ithaca.

> But still, I hope you keep your own possessions,

> and rule your house. May no man drive you out,

> and seize your wealth, while Ithaca survives.

> Now, friend, I want to ask about the stranger.

> Where was he from, what country? Did he say?

> Where is his place of birth, his native soil?

> Does he bring news your father will come home?

> Or did he come here for some other purpose?[ 410]{.calibre4}

> How suddenly he darted off, not waiting

> for us to meet him. Yet he looked important."

> The boy said soberly, "Eurymachus,

> my father is not ever coming home.

> I do not listen now to any gossip,

> or forecasts from the psychics whom my mother

> invites to visit us. The stranger was

> my father's guest-friend Mentes, son of wise

> Anchialus, who rules the Taphians,

> the people of the oar."

> > > > > > Those were his words,[ 420]{.calibre4}

> but in his mind he knew she was a god.

> They danced to music and enjoyed themselves

> till evening, then they went back home to sleep.

> Telemachus' bedroom had been built

> above the courtyard, so it had a view.

> He went upstairs, preoccupied by thought.

> A loyal slave went with him, Eurycleia,

> daughter of Ops; she brought the burning torches.

> Laertes bought her many years before

> when she was very young, for twenty oxen.[ 430]{.calibre4}

> He gave her status in the household, equal

> to his own wife, but never slept with her,

> avoiding bitter feelings in his marriage.

> She brought the torches now; she was the slave

> who loved him most, since she had cared for him

> when he was tiny. Entering the room,

> he sat down on the bed, took off his tunic,

> and gave it to the vigilant old woman.

> She smoothed it out and folded it, then hung it

> up on a hook beside his wooden bed,[ 440]{.calibre4}

> and left the room. She used the silver latch

> to close the door; the strap pulled tight the bolt.

> He slept the night there, wrapped in woolen blankets,

> planning the journey told him by Athena.

> Has he found out an army is approaching?

> Or does he have some other piece of news

> I think he is a helpful, decent man.

> I called the meeting. I am in deep trouble.[ 40]{.calibre4}

> I have no information of an army

> of any other danger to our people.

> I need help for myself. My family

> has suffered two disasters. First I lost

> my father, who was kind to you as if

> you also were his sons. Now, even worse,

> my house is being ripped apart; my wealth

> will soon be gone! The sons of all the nobles

> have shoved inside my house to court my mother,[ 50]{.calibre4}

> against her wishes. They should go and ask

> Icarius her father to provide

> a dowry, and choose who should be her husband.

> They are too scared. Instead, they haunt our house

> day after day, and kill our cows and pigs

> and good fat goats. They feast and drink red wine,

> not caring if they waste it all. There is

> no man to save the house---no man like him,

> Odysseus. I cannot fight against them;

> I would be useless. I have had no training.[ 60]{.calibre4}

> But if I had the power, I would do it!

> It is unbearable, what they have done!

> They ruined my whole house! It is not fair!

> You suitors all should feel ashamed! Consider

> what others in the neighborhood will think!

> And also be afraid! The angry gods

> will turn on you in rage; they will be shocked

> at all this criminal behavior!

> I beg you, by Olympian Zeus, and by

> the goddess who presides in human meetings:[ 70]{.calibre4}

> Justice! But never mind. Friends, leave me be,

> and let me cry and suffer by myself.

> Or did Odysseus, my warlike father,

> deliberately do harm to our own side?

> Is that why you seem set on hurting me,

> encouraging these suitors? Oh, if only

> you Ithacans would eat my stock yourselves!

> If you did that, I soon would get revenge;

> I would come through the town and keep demanding,

> until it all got given back. But now,[ 80]{.calibre4}

> you make me so unhappy! This is pointless!"

> He stopped, frustrated, flung the scepter down,

> and burst out crying. Everyone was seized

> by pity. No one spoke; they hesitated

> to answer him unkindly. Then at last

> Antinous began.

> > > > > "Telemachus,

> you stuck-up, wilful little boy! How dare you

> Go blame your precious mother! She is cunning.[ 90]{.calibre4}

> It is the third year, soon it will be four,

> that she has cheated us of what we want.

> She offers hope to all, sends notes to each,

> but all the while her mind moves somewhere else.

> She came up with a special trick: she fixed

> a mighty loom inside the palace hall.

> Weaving her fine long cloth, she said to us,

> 'Young men, you are my suitors. Since my husband,

> the brave Odysseus, is dead, I know

> you want to marry me. You must be patient;[ 100]{.calibre4}

> I have worked hard to weave this winding-sheet

> to bury good Laertes when he dies.

> He gained such wealth, the women would reproach me

> if he were buried with no shroud. Please let me

> finish it!' And her words made sense to us.

> So every day she wove the mighty cloth,

> and then at night by torchlight, she unwove it.

> For three long years her trick beguiled the Greeks.

> But when the fourth year's seasons rolled around,

> a woman slave who knew the truth told us. [ 110]{.calibre4}

> We caught her there, unraveling the cloth,

> and made her finish it. This is our answer,

> so you and all the Greeks may understand.

> Dismiss your mother, let her father tell her

> to marry anyone his heart desires.

> Athena blessed her with intelligence,

> great artistry and skill, a finer mind

> than anyone has ever had before,

> even the braided girls of ancient Greece,

> Tyro, Alcmene, garlanded Mycene---[ 120]{.calibre4}

> none of them had Penelope's understanding.

> They burned the thigh-bones for the god, and ate

> took down their sails, dropped anchor and alighted.

> The goddess with the flashing eyes, Athena,

> > > She looked straight into his eyes,

> how did the great King Agamemnon die?

> And where was Menelaus? Was he lost,

> away from Greece, when that Aegisthus dared[ 250]{.calibre4}

> to kill a king, a better man than him?

> How did that wicked trickster's plot succeed?"

> Gerenian Nestor, lord of horses, answered,

> "I will tell everything---though you can guess

> what would have happened if fair Menelaus

> had found Aegisthus living in his halls

> on his return. And even when he died,

> no one would bury him; he lay upon

> the open plain without a tomb and far

> from town for birds and dogs to eat. No Greek[ 260]{.calibre4}

> would mourn that monster. While we fought and labored

> at Troy, this layabout sat safe in Argos,

> seducing Clytemnestra, noble wife

> of Agamemnon. For a while, she scorned

> his foul suggestions, since her heart was good.

> Moreover, when her husband went to Troy,

> he left a poet, ordered to protect her.

> But finally Fate forced the queen to yield.

> Aegisthus left the poet to be eaten

> by birds, abandoned on a desert island.[ 270]{.calibre4}

> He led the woman back to his own house

> by mutual desire, and then he made

> numerous offerings on holy altars

> of animals and lovely gold and cloth:

> he had succeeded far beyond his hopes.

> And meanwhile, I left Troy with Menelaus;

> we sailed together, best of friends. We reached

> the holy cape of Athens, Sounion.

> There Phoebus with his gentle arrows shot

> and killed the pilot, Phrontis, as he held[ 280]{.calibre4}

> the ship's helm as she sped along. No man

> knew better how to steer through any storm,

> so Menelaus stopped to bury him

> with proper rites. At last he sailed again

> across the wine-dark sea; but as his ships

> rushed round the craggy heights of Malea,

> far-seeing Zeus sent curses on his journey,

> pouring out screaming winds and giant waves

> the size of mountains---splitting up the fleet.

> Some ships were hurled to Crete, to River Jardan,[ 290]{.calibre4}

> where the Cydonian people have their homes.

> There steep rock rises sheer above the sea

> near Gortyn in the misty deep; south winds

> drive mighty waves towards the left-hand crag,

> and push them west to Phaestus; one small rock

> restrains the massive currents. All the ships

> were smashed by waves against those rocks. The men

> were almost drowned. Five other dark-prowed ships

> were blown by wind and sea away to Egypt.

> There Menelaus gathered wealth and gold[ 300]{.calibre4}

> and drifted with his ships through foreign lands.

> Meanwhile at home, Aegisthus had been plotting.

> He killed the son of Atreus and seized

> control of rich Mycenae, where he reigned

> for seven years. But in the eighth, Orestes

> came to destroy him. He returned from Athens,

> and killed his father's murderer, then called

> the Argives to a funeral, a feast

> for clever, scheming, cowardly Aegisthus

> whom he had killed, and his own hated mother.[ 310]{.calibre4}

> That very day, rambunctious Menelaus

> arrived with all his ships crammed full of treasure.

> The moral is, you must not stay away

> too long, dear boy, when those proud suitors lurk

> inside your house. They may divide your wealth

> among themselves and make your journey useless.

> But I suggest you go to Menelaus.

> He recently returned from lands so distant

> no one would even hope to get home safe

> once driven by the winds so far off course,[ 320]{.calibre4}

> over such dangerous, enormous seas.

> Birds migrate there and take a year or more

> to travel back. Go visit him by ship

> with your own crew. Or if you would prefer,

> you can go there by land---here is a carriage.

> My sons can guide you all the way to Sparta,

> to Menelaus. Ask him for the truth.

> He will not lie; he is an honest man."

> The sun went down and darkness fell. The goddess,

> bright-eyed Athena, spoke to them.

> > > > > > "King Nestor,[ 330]{.calibre4}

> your speech was good and your advice was sound.

> But now slice up the tongues and pour the wine

> The light is fading and it is not right

> The people listened to Athena's words.

> The house slaves poured fresh water on their hands,

> and boys filled up the mixing bowls with wine,

> and poured it into cups, and first prepared[ 340]{.calibre4}

> the sacrifice. They threw tongues on the fire,

> Then Zeus' daughter and the godlike boy

> But Nestor called to stop them.

> > > > > > "Zeus forbids it!

> And all the other gods who live forever!

> You cannot leave my house for your swift ship

> with so few beds and blankets in his home

> that neither he nor guests can sleep in comfort.[ 350]{.calibre4}

> I have soft quilts and blankets in abundance.

> The darling son of great Odysseus

> Not while my sons remain here in my house,

> The bright-eyed goddess answered him, "Old friend,

> He will stay here tonight and go to sleep

> to tell the crew the news and keep them strong.

> You see, I am the oldest in our party.

> The rest are younger men, close friends together,

> I will sleep there beside the hollow ship.

> At dawn I have important obligations:

> The boy can be your guest. Then send him off

> Bright-eyed Athena flew away, transformed

> He seized Telemachus' hand and said,

> "Dear boy, I am now sure that you will be

> who also glorified your noble father.

> Goddess, be kind to us as well, and grant[ 380]{.calibre4}

> honor to me, my good wife, and our sons.

> Now I will sacrifice a yearling heifer,

> > > > > > So he spoke,

> inside his own magnificent great hall.

> When they were all inside, he seated them

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> At that, the sons all got to work. The cow

> The axe sliced through the sinews of the neck.

> to stand beside him holding five-pronged forks.[ 460]{.calibre4}

> They burned the thigh-bones thoroughly and tasted

[[What the Sea God Said]{.calibre6}](#index_split_005.html_filepos2857)

> They came to Sparta, land of caves and valleys,

> and drove to Menelaus' house. They found him

> hosting a wedding feast for many guests

> to celebrate his children's marriages.

> In Troy he had declared that he would give

> his daughter to Achilles' son, who ruled

> the Myrmidons. Now he was sending her,

> with dowry gifts of horse-drawn chariots;

> the gods had made the marriage come to pass.

> And he was welcoming a Spartan bride,[ 10]{.calibre4}

> Alector's daughter, for his well-loved son,

> strong Megapenthes, mothered by a slave.

> The gods had given Helen no more children

> after the beautiful Hermione,

> image of Aphrodite all in gold.

> Neighbors and family were feasting gladly

> under the king's high roof. The bard was singing

> and strumming, and two acrobats were spinning

> and leading them in dance. Telemachus

> and Nestor's son stopped by the palace doors [ 20]{.calibre4}

> and held their horses. Menelaus' guard,

> Eteoneus, ran out and saw them there,

> and then hurried back inside to tell his master.

> "Your Majesty, there are two men outside,

> strangers who seem like sons of Zeus. Please tell me,

> should we take off the harness from their horses?

> Or send them off to find another host?"

> Flushed Menelaus shouted angrily,

> "You used to have some brains!

> Now you are talking like a silly child.[ 30]{.calibre4}

> We two were fed by many different hosts

> before returning home. As we may hope

> for Zeus to keep us safe in future times,

> untack their horses! Lead them in to dine!"

> So Eteoneus rushed out from the palace,

> and ordered other slaves to follow him.

> They freed the sweating horses from their yoke

> and tied them by the manger, which they filled

> with emmer that they mixed with bright white barley.

> They leaned the carriage up against the wall[ 40]{.calibre4}

> and led their guests inside the godlike house.

> The boys looked round the palace in amazement:

> the lofty halls of famous Menelaus

> shone like the dazzling light of sun or moon.

> When they had satisfied their eyes with staring,

> they went to take a bath in polished tubs.

> The slave girls helped them wash and rubbed them down

> in olive oil, then dressed them in wool cloaks

> and tunics, and then seated them beside

> the son of Atreus, King Menelaus. [ 50]{.calibre4}

> A house girl brought a basin made of silver,

> and water in a golden jug. She poured it

> over their hands to wash, then set a table

> of polished wood beside them, and a humble

> slave girl brought bread and many canapés,

> a lavish spread. The carver carried platters

> with every kind of meat, and set before them

> cups made of gold. Then ruddy Menelaus

> welcomed them both and told them,

> > > > > > "Help yourselves!

> Enjoy the food! When you have shared our meal,[ 60]{.calibre4}

> we will begin to ask you who you are.

> Your fathers must be scepter-bearing kings;

> the sons of peasants do not look like you."

> With that, he took the dish of rich roast meat,

> cut from the back, which was his special meal,

> and offered it to them. They reached their hands

> to take the food set out in front of them.

> After their thirst and hunger had been sated,

> Telemachus turned round to Nestor's son,

> ducking his head so no one else could hear.[ 70]{.calibre4}

> "Pisistratus! Dear friend, do you see how

> these echoing halls are shining bright with bronze,

> and silver, gold and ivory and amber?

> It is as full of riches as the palace

> of Zeus on Mount Olympus! I am struck

> with awe." When Menelaus heard his words,

> he spoke to them in turn---his words flew out.

> "No mortal, my dear boys, can rival Zeus.

> His halls and home and property are deathless.

> Some man may match my wealth; or maybe not.[ 80]{.calibre4}

> I suffered for it. I was lost, adrift

> at sea for eight long years. I traipsed through Cyprus,

> Phoenicia, Egypt, Ethiopia,

> Sidon and Araby, and Libya,

> where lambs are born with horns---their ewes give birth

> three times a year. The master and his slave

> have milk and cheese and meat; the flock provides

> sweet milk year round. But while I wandered there

> accumulating wealth, someone crept in

> and killed my brother; his own scheming wife [ 90]{.calibre4}

> betrayed him. I can take no joy in all

> my wealth. Whoever they may be, your fathers

> have surely told you how much I have suffered!

> I lost my lovely home, and I was parted

> for many years from all my splendid riches.

> I wish I had stayed here, with just a third

> of all the treasure I have now acquired,

> if those who died at Troy, so far away

> from Argive pastures, were alive and well.

> I sit here in my palace, mourning all [ 100]{.calibre4}

> who died, and often weeping. Sometimes tears

> bring comfort to my heart, but not for long;

> cold grief grows sickening. I miss them all,

> but one man most. When I remember him,

> I cannot eat or sleep, since no one labored

> like him---Odysseus. His destiny

> was suffering, and mine the endless pain

> of missing him. We do not even know

> if he is still alive---he has been gone

> so long. His faithful wife and old Laertes[ 110]{.calibre4}

> must grieve for him, and young Telemachus,

> who was a newborn when he went away."

> These words roused in the boy a desperate need

> to mourn his father. Tears rolled down his face

> and splashed down on the ground. He lifted up

> his cloak to hide his eyes. But Menelaus

> noticed and wondered whether he should wait

> until the boy first spoke about his father,

> or ask. As he was hesitating, Helen

> emerged from her high-ceilinged, fragrant bedroom,[ 120]{.calibre4}

> like Artemis, who carries golden arrows.

> Adraste set a special chair for her,

> Alcippe spread upon it soft wool blankets,

> and Phylo brought a silver sewing basket,

> given to her by Alcandre, the wife

> of Polybus, who lived in Thebes, in Egypt,

> where people have extraordinary wealth.

> He gave two silver tubs to Menelaus,

> a pair of tripods and ten pounds of gold.

> His wife gave other lovely gifts for Helen:[ 130]{.calibre4}

> a golden spindle and this silver basket

> on wheels; the rims were finished off with gold.

> Phylo, her girl, brought out that basket now,

> packed full of yarn she had already spun.

> A spindle wound around with purple wool

> was laid across it. She sat down and put

> her feet upon a stool, and asked her husband,

> "Do we know who these men are, Menelaus,

> who have arrived here in our house? Shall I

> conceal my thoughts or speak? I feel compelled[ 140]{.calibre4}

> to say, the sight of them amazes me.

> I never saw two people so alike

> as this boy and Telemachus, the son

> of spirited Odysseus, the child

> he left behind, a little newborn baby,

> the day the Greeks marched off to Troy, their minds

> fixated on the war and violence.

> They made my face the cause that hounded them."

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> High-colored Menelaus answered, "Wife,

> I saw the likeness too. Odysseus[ 150]{.calibre4}

> had hands like those, those legs, that hair, that head,

> that glancing gaze. And when I spoke just now

> about Odysseus and all the things

> he suffered for my sake, the boy grimaced,

> and floods of tears were rolling down his cheeks;

> he raised his purple cloak to hide his eyes."

> Pisistratus, the son of Nestor, spoke.

> "King Menelaus, you are right. This is

> that warrior's true-born son, just as you said.

> But he is shy and feels he should not speak[ 160]{.calibre4}

> too boldly in your presence right away.

> Your voice is like a god's to us. Lord Nestor

> sent me to guide him here. He longed to see you

> to get some news from you or some advice.

> A son whose father is away will suffer

> intensely, if he has no man at home

> to help him. In the absence of his father,

> Telemachus has no one to protect him."

> Then Menelaus answered, "So the son

> of my dear friend, who worked so hard for me,[ 170]{.calibre4}

> has come here to my house! I always thought

> that I would greet that friend with warmth beyond

> all other Argives, if Zeus let us sail

> Nothing would have divided us in love[ 180]{.calibre4}

> and joy, till death's dark cloud surrounded us.

> But I suppose the god begrudged our friendship,

> and kept that poor, unlucky man from home."

> His words made everybody want to cry.

> Helen was weeping, as was Menelaus.

> Pisistratus' eyes were full of tears

> for irreplaceable Antilochus,

> killed by the noble son of shining Dawn.

> Mindful of him, he spoke with words like wings.

> "King Menelaus, when we spoke of you [ 190]{.calibre4}

> back home in our own halls, my father Nestor

> always declared you are exceptional

> for common sense. So listen now to me.

> I disapprove of crying during dinner.

> Dawn will soon come; weep then. There is no harm

> to cut our hair and drench our cheeks with tears.

> I had a brother named Antilochus,

> one of the bravest fighters in the army,[ 200]{.calibre4}

> a sprinter and a warrior. He died.

> I never got to meet him or to see him.

> Perhaps you did?"

> > > > > King Menelaus answered,

> "My friend, you speak just as a wise man should,

> like somebody much older than yourself.

> You show your father's wisdom in your speech.

> A lineage is easy to discern

> when Zeus spins out a life of happiness,

> in marriage and in offspring. So he gave

> good luck to Nestor all his life; he aged[ 210]{.calibre4}

> at home in comfort, and his sons are wise

> and skillful spear-men. Yes, we will stop crying

> and turn our minds to dinner once again.

> Let them pour water on our hands. At dawn,

> Telemachus and I can talk at length."

> At that Asphalion, the nimble house slave

> of mighty Menelaus, poured the water

> over their hands. They helped themselves to food

> from laden tables. Then the child of Zeus,

> Helen, decided she would mix the wine[ 220]{.calibre4}

> with drugs to take all pain and rage away,

> Whoever drinks this mixture from the bowl

> Helen had these powerful magic drugs

> from Polydamna, wife of Thon, from Egypt,

> where fertile fields produce the most narcotics:[ 230]{.calibre4}

> some good, some dangerous. The people there

> > > > > > "Now Menelaus,

> I cannot tell of all the challenges[ 240]{.calibre4}

> But I will tell you what that brave man did

> at Troy, when the Achaeans were in trouble.

> He beat himself and bruised his body badly

> and put a ragged cloak on, like a slave,

> then shuffled through the enemy city streets.

> In his disguise he seemed a poor old beggar,

> hardly a man to sail with the Achaeans.

> He crept through Troy like that, and no one knew him

> except for me. I saw through his disguise[ 250]{.calibre4}

> and questioned him. He was too smart to talk,

> He told me all the things the Greeks were planning.

> The Trojan women keened in grief, but I[ 260]{.calibre4}

> was glad---by then I wanted to go home.

> I wished that Aphrodite had not made me

> And Menelaus said,

> > > > > "Yes, wife, quite right.

> 'Stranger, are you so foolish that you choose

> There is no end in sight; you have been stuck

> 'Whoever you may be---for sure a goddess---

> I tell you I am trapped against my will.

> I must have sinned against the deathless gods

> who live in heaven. Please explain which spirit

> That shining goddess answered me at once, [ 380]{.calibre4}

> 'Stranger, I will be frank with you. A deathless

> old sea god haunts this place, named Proteus

> of Egypt, who can speak infallibly,

> who knows the depths of seas, and serves Poseidon.

> They say he is the one who fathered me.

> If you can somehow lie in wait and catch him,

> he will explain how you can get back home,

> plotting your path where fish leap through the waters.

> And if you wish it, prince, he will explain

> what happened in your home, both good and bad, [ 390]{.calibre4}

> while you were gone on this long, painful journey.'

> Those were her words. I answered, 'Tell me, please,

> how I can trap this ancient god, so he

> will not see me too soon, and get away.

> It is not easy for a man to catch

> 'Stranger, I will instruct you thoroughly.

> When the sun hits the midpoint of the sky,

> the old god bobs above the salty water;

> the breath of Zephyr hides him in dark shade. [ 400]{.calibre4}

> He goes to take his nap inside the caves.

> Around him sleep the clustering seals, the daughters

> from gray seawater, pungent salty depths.

> Select the three best men you have on board,

> and when dawn breaks, I will take all of you

> down to the shore, and set you in a line.

> Let me explain the old god's tricks. He will

> first count the seals and walk around among them.

> When he has counted them and checked them all, [ 410]{.calibre4}

> he lies down in the middle, like a shepherd

> among his flock of sheep. When you observe

> and hold him there, despite his desperate struggles.

> In trying to escape, he will change shape

> to every animal on earth, and then

> At last he will assume again the form

> which god is angry with you, and the way

> With that she sank beneath the deep sea waves.

> I went down to the ships upon the sand.

> My heart was surging in me as I walked.

> Arriving at the ships and at the shore,

> we made our meal. Then came immortal night;

> we went to sleep beside the water's edge.[ 430]{.calibre4}

> When Dawn appeared, her fingers bright with flowers,

> I walked beside the spreading sea, along

> Then I chose out my three most trusted men.

> The goddess dove down deep inside the sea

> new-flayed---to help her plot against her father.

> She scooped out hiding places in the sand,

> and sat to wait. We came right up to her.

> She laid us in a row, and put a skin[ 440]{.calibre4}

> on each. It would have been a dismal hideout,

> stinking of salt-bred seals. Who would lie down

> But she brought sweet ambrosia to save us.

> She very kindly put it in our nostrils,

> his fatted seals and counted out their number.

> He counted us among the first of them,

> suspecting nothing. Then he lay down too.

> With a great shout we pounced on him and grabbed him.

> The old god still remembered all his tricks,

> and first became a lion with a mane,

> then snake, then leopard, then a mighty boar,

> then flowing water, then a leafy tree.

> But we kept holding on: our hearts stood firm.

> At last that ancient sorcerer grew tired,[ 460]{.calibre4}

> and then he asked me, 'Son of Atreus!

> What god devised this plan with you and taught you

> to lurk and capture me against my will?

> What do you want from me?' And I replied,

> 'Old god, why do you want to throw me off?

> You know I have been trapped here on this island

> grows faint. So tell me---gods know everything---

> what spirit stops my journey? And how can I

> At once he answered me and told me this:

> 'You should have given Zeus and other gods

> across the wine-dark sea. It is your fate

> not to go home or see the ones you love

> until you go again to Egypt's river,

> watered by Zeus, and kill a hundred cows,

> to please the deathless gods who live in heaven.

> Then they will let you travel where you wish.'

> I felt heartbroken that I had to cross[ 480]{.calibre4}

> the misty sea and go again to Egypt:

> a long and bitter journey! But I answered,

> 'Sir, I will do exactly as you say.

> But come now, tell me this, and tell me truly,

> did all the Greeks sail safely home by ship,

> whom Nestor and myself left there in Troy?

> Did any meet a dreadful death at sea,

> on his own ship, or in familiar arms,

> after the war wound up?' When I said this,

> at once he answered me and said these words.[ 490]{.calibre4}

> 'O son of Atreus! Why ask me this?

> You have no need to know or learn my mind.

> When I have told you, you will not be long

> able to hold back tears. So many men

> The boundless waves washed over him; he drank[ 510]{.calibre4}

> Then joyfully he stepped foot in his country,[ 520]{.calibre4}

> and touched and kissed the earth of his dear home.

> He wept hot floods of tears, from happiness.

> But from the lookout post the watchman saw him.

> Scheming Aegisthus paid that man two talents

> "Please do not keep me here so long, my lord.

> Indeed, I would be glad to stay a year;

> Then knowledgeable Medon answered her,

> "My Queen, I wish this were the worst of it.

> Now they are plotting even greater ruin.

> May Zeus ensure it never comes to pass!

> Zeus orders you to send him on his way

> at once, since it is not his destiny

> It is his fate to see his family

> Calypso shuddered and let fly at him.

> "You cruel, jealous gods! You bear a grudge

> to sleep with as a lover in her bed.[ 120]{.calibre4}

> Just so the gods who live at ease were angry

> Zeus pinned his ship and with his flash of lightning

> I am quite ready now to send you off.

> Using your sword of bronze, cut trunks and build

> > > > > > Odysseus,

> shuddered and let his words fly out at her.

> "Goddess, you have some other scheme in mind,

> in just a raft, when even stable schooners

> sped on by winds from Zeus would not succeed?

> No, goddess, I will not get on a raft,

> unless you swear to me a mighty oath

> At that, divine Calypso smiled at him.[ 180]{.calibre4}

> She reached out and caressed him with her hand,

> saying, "You scalawag! What you have said

> shows that you understand how these things work.

> But by this earth, and by the sky above,

> and by the waters of the Styx below,

> which is the strongest oath for blessed gods,

> I swear I will not plot more pain for you.

> I have made plans for you as I would do

> for my own self, if I were in your place.

> I am not made of iron; no, my heart [ 190]{.calibre4}

> is kind and decent, and I pity you."

> And with those words, the goddess quickly turned

> and led the way; he followed in her footsteps.

> They reached the cave together, man and goddess.

> The chair that Hermes had been sitting on

> was empty now; Odysseus sat there.

> The goddess gave him human food and drink.

> She sat and faced godlike Odysseus

> while slave girls brought her nectar and ambrosia.

> They reached to take the good things set before them,[ 200]{.calibre4}

> and satisfied their hunger and their thirst.

> The goddess-queen began. "Odysseus,

> son of Laertes, blessed by Zeus---your plans

> are always changing. Do you really want

> to go back to that home you love so much?

> Well then, good-bye! But if you understood

> how glutted you will be with suffering

> before you reach your home, you would stay here

> with me and be immortal---though you might

> still wish to see that wife you always pine for.[ 210]{.calibre4}

> And anyway, I know my body is

> Mortals can never rival the immortals

> > > So Odysseus, with tact,

> said "Do not be enraged at me, great goddess.

> You are quite right. I know my modest wife

> Penelope could never match your beauty.

> She is a human; you are deathless, ageless.

> But even so, I want to go back home,

> and every day I hope that day will come.[ 220]{.calibre4}

> If some god strikes me on the wine-dark sea,

> I will endure it. By now I am used

> to suffering---I have gone through so much,

> at sea and in the war. Let this come too."

> The sun went down and brought the darkness on.

> They went inside the hollow cave and took

> the pleasure of their love, held close together.

> When vernal Dawn first touched the sky with flowers,

> they rose and dressed: Odysseus put on

> his cloak and tunic, and Calypso wore[ 230]{.calibre4}

> her fine long robe of silver. Round her waist

> she wrapped a golden belt, and veiled her head.

> Then she prepared the journey for the man.

> She gave an axe that fitted in his grip,

> its handle made of finest olive wood;

> its huge bronze blade was sharp on either side.

> She also gave a polished adze. She led him

> out to the island's end, where tall trees grew:

> black poplar, alder, fir that touched the sky,

> good for a nimble boat of seasoned timber.[ 240]{.calibre4}

> When she had shown him where the tall trees grew,

> Calypso, queen of goddesses, went home.

> Odysseus began and made good progress.

> With his bronze axe he cut down twenty trunks,

> polished them skillfully and planed them straight.

> Calypso brought a gimlet and he drilled

> through every plank and fitted them together,

> fixing it firm with pegs and fastenings.

> As wide as when a man who knows his trade

> marks out the curving hull to fit a ship,[ 250]{.calibre4}

> so wide Odysseus marked out his raft.

> He notched the side decks to the close-set frame

> and fixed long planks along the ribs to finish.

> He set a mast inside, and joined to it

> a yardarm and a rudder to steer straight.

> He heaped the boat with brush, and caulked the sides

> with wickerwork, to keep the water out.

> Calypso brought him fabric for a sail,

> and he constructed that with equal skill.

> He fastened up the braces, clews and halyards, [ 260]{.calibre4}

> and using levers, launched her on the sea.

> The work had taken four days; on the fifth

> Calypso let him go. She washed and dressed him

> in clothes that smelled of incense. On the raft

> she put a flask of wine, a bigger flask

> of water, and a large supply of food.

> She sent him off with gentle, lukewarm breezes.

> Gladly Odysseus spread out his sails

> to catch the wind; with skill he steered the rudder.

> No sleep fell on his eyes; he watched the stars,[ 270]{.calibre4}

> the Pleiades, late-setting Boötes,

> and Bear, which people also call the Plow,

> which circles in one place, and marks Orion---

> the only star that has no share of Ocean.

> Calypso, queen of goddesses, had told him

> to keep the Bear on his left side while sailing.

> He sailed the sea for seven days and ten,

> and on the eighteenth day, a murky mountain

> of the Phaeacian land appeared---it rose

> up like a shield beyond the misty sea.[ 280]{.calibre4}

> Returning from the Ethiopians,

> and pausing on Mount Solyma, Poseidon,

> Master of Earthquakes, saw the distant raft.

> Enraged, he shook his head and told himself,

> "This is outrageous! So it seems the gods

> have changed their plans about Odysseus

> while I was absent! He has almost reached

> Phaeacia, where it is his destiny

> to flee the rope of pain that binds him now.

> But I will goad him to more misery, [ 290]{.calibre4}

> till he is sick of it."

> > > > > He gathered up

> the clouds, and seized his trident and stirred round

> the sea and roused the gusts of every wind,

> and covered earth and sea with fog. Night stretched

> from heaven. Eurus, Notus, blasting Zephyr

> and Boreas, the child of sky, all fell

> and rolled a mighty wave. Odysseus

> grew weak at knees. He cried out in despair,

> "More pain? How will it end? I am afraid

> the goddess spoke the truth: that I will have[ 300]{.calibre4}

> a sea of sufferings before I reach

> I can hold on to one thing: certain death.

> of Peleus' son. I would have had

> a funeral, and honor from the Greeks;

> but now I have to die this cruel death!"

> A wave crashed onto him, and overturned

> out of his hands. The winds blew all directions

> and one enormous gust snapped off the mast.

> The sail and yardarm drifted out to sea.

> Then for a long time rushing, crashing waves

> The clothes Calypso gave him weighed him down.

> At last he rose and spat the sour saltwater

> Despite his pain and weakness, he remembered

> he climbed on top of it and clung to life.

> The great waves carried it this way and that.

> As when the thistles, clumping close together,

> so these winds swept the raft across the sea.[ 330]{.calibre4}

> The South Wind hurls it, then the North Wind grabs it,

> then East Wind yields and lets the West Wind drive it.

> But stepping softly, Ino, the White Goddess,

> Cadmus' child, once human, human-voiced,

> now honored with the gods in salty depths,

> noticed that he was suffering and lost,

> with pity. Like a gull with wings outstretched

> she rose up from the sea, sat on the raft

> and said,

> > > "Poor man! Why does enraged Poseidon

> create an odyssey of pain for you?[ 340]{.calibre4}

> But his hostility will not destroy you.

> You seem intelligent. Do as I say.

> Strip off your clothes and leave the raft behind

> you need not be afraid of death or danger.

> But when you reach dry earth, untie the scarf

> and throw it out to sea, away from land,[ 350]{.calibre4}

> and turn away." With that, the goddess gave it,

> and plunged back down inside the surging sea,

> just like a gull. The black wave covered her.

> The hero who had suffered so much danger

> was troubled and confused. He asked himself,

> "Some deity has said to leave the raft.

> But what if gods are weaving tricks again?

> I will not trust her yet: with my own eyes

> I saw the land she said I should escape to,

> and it is far away. I will do this:[ 360]{.calibre4}

> as long as these wood timbers hold together,

> I will hang on, however hard it is.

> But when the waves have smashed my raft to pieces,

> then I will have no choice, and I will swim."

> While he was thinking this, the Lord of Earthquakes,

> Poseidon, roused a huge and dreadful wave

> that arched above his head: he hurled it at him.

> As when a fierce wind ruffles up a heap

> of dry wheat chaff; it scatters here and there;

> so were the raft's long timbers flung apart.[ 370]{.calibre4}

> He climbed astride a plank and rode along

> as if on horseback. He took off the clothes

> Calypso gave him, but he tied the scarf

> around his chest, and dove into the sea,

> spreading his arms to swim. The Lord of Earthquakes

> saw him and nodded, muttering, "At last

> you are in pain! Go drift across the sea,

> till you meet people blessed by Zeus, the Sky Lord.

> But even then, I think you will not lack

> for suffering." He spurred his fine-maned horses,[ 380]{.calibre4}

> and went to Aegae, where he had his home.

> Athena, child of Zeus, devised a plan.

> She blocked the path of all the other winds,

> told them to cease and made them go to sleep,

> but roused swift Boreas and smoothed the waves

> in front of him, so that Odysseus

> could reach Phaeacia and escape from death.

> Two days and nights he drifted on the waves:

> each moment he expected he would die.

> But when the Dawn with dazzling braids brought day[ 390]{.calibre4}

> for the third time, the wind died down. No breeze,

> but total calm. As he was lifted up

> by an enormous wave, he scanned around,

> and saw the shore nearby. As when a father

> lies sick and weak for many days, tormented

> by some cruel spirit, till at last the gods

> restore him back to life; his children feel

> great joy; Odysseus felt that same joy

> when he saw land. He swam and longed to set

> his feet on earth. But when he was in earshot,[ 400]{.calibre4}

> he heard the boom of surf against the rocks.

> The mighty waves were crashing on the shore,

> a dreadful belching. Everything was covered

> in salty foam. There were no sheltering harbors

> for ships, just sheer crags, reefs and solid cliffs.

> Odysseus' heart and legs gave way.

> Shaken but purposeful, he told himself,

> "Zeus went beyond my hopes and let me see

> dry land! I made it, cutting the abyss!

> But I see no way out from this gray sea.[ 410]{.calibre4}

> There are steep cliffs offshore, and all around

> the rushing water roars; the rock runs sheer;

> the sea is deep near shore; there is no way

> to set my feet on land without disaster.

> If I attempt to scramble out, a wave

> will seize and dash me on the jagged rock;

> a useless effort. But if I swim on farther,

> looking for bays or coves or slanting beaches,

> storm winds may seize me once again and drag me,

> howling with grief, towards the fish-filled sea.[ 420]{.calibre4}

> A god may even send a great sea-monster,

> the kind that famous Amphitrite rears.

> I know Poseidon wants to do me harm."

> Meanwhile, Athena went to the Phaeacians.

> This people used to live in Hyperia,

> a land of dancing. But their mighty neighbors,

> the Cyclopes, kept looting them, and they

> Bright-eyed Athena traveled to his palace,

> to help Odysseus' journey home.

> She went inside the decorated bedroom

> where the young princess, Nausicaa, was sleeping,

> as lovely as a goddess. Slaves were sleeping

> outside her doorway, one on either side;

> two charming girls with all the Graces' gifts.

> The shining doors were shut, but like the wind[ 20]{.calibre4}

> the goddess reached the bed of Nausicaa,

> disguised as her best friend, a girl her age,

> Sharp-eyed Athena said,

> So lazy! But your mother should have taught you!

> Your clothes are lying there in dirty heaps,

> Surely you will not long remain unmarried.

> The best young men here in your native land

> already want to court you. So at dawn

> go ask your father for the cart with mules,

> to carry dresses, scarves, and sheets. You should

> The place is never shaken by the wind,

> A cloudless sky is spread above the mountain,

> white radiance all round. The blessed gods

> Then Dawn came from her lovely throne, and woke

> Her mother sat beside the hearth and spun

> dressed in your best to make important plans.

> Your five sons also---two of whom are married,

> He called the household slaves, and they obeyed.

> They made the wagon ready and inspected

> I heard the sound of female voices. Is it

> Or could this noise I hear be human voices?

> I have to try to find out who they are."

> Odysseus jumped up from out the bushes.

> Just as a mountain lion trusts its strength,[ 130]{.calibre4}

> All caked with salt, he looked a dreadful sight.

> They ran along the shore quite terrified,

> some here, some there. But Nausicaa stayed still.

> Athena made her legs stop trembling[ 140]{.calibre4}

> and gave her courage in her heart. She stood there.

> He wondered, should he touch her knees, or keep

> some distance and use charming words, to beg

> the pretty girl to show him to the town,

> and give him clothes. At last he thought it best

> to keep some distance and use words to beg her.

> The girl might be alarmed at being touched.

> His words were calculated flattery.

> "My lady, please! Are you divine or human?

> If you are some great goddess from the sky,[ 150]{.calibre4}

> you look like Zeus' daughter Artemis---

> you are as tall and beautiful as she.

> But if you live on earth and are a human,

> your mother and your father must be lucky,

> your brothers also---lucky three times over.

> Their hearts must be delighted, seeing you,

> their flourishing new sprout, the dancers' leader.

> And that man will be luckiest by far,

> who takes you home with dowry, as his bride.

> I have seen no one like you. Never, no one.[ 160]{.calibre4}

> My eyes are dazzled when I look at you.

> I traveled once to Delos, on my way

> to war and suffering; my troops marched with me.

> Beside Apollo's altar sprang a sapling,

> a fresh young palm. I gazed at it and marveled.

> I never saw so magical a tree.

> My lady, you transfix me that same way.

> I am in awe of you, afraid to touch

> your knees. But I am desperate. I came from

> Ogygia, and for twenty days storm winds[ 170]{.calibre4}

> and waves were driving me, adrift until

> yesterday some god washed me up right here,

> perhaps to meet more suffering. I think

> my troubles will not end until the gods

> have done their all. My lady, pity me.

> Battered and wrecked, I come to you, you first---

> and I know no one else in this whole country.

> Show me the town, give me some rags to wear,

> if you brought any clothes when you came here.

> So may the gods grant all your heart's desires,[ 180]{.calibre4}

> a home and husband, somebody like-minded.

> For nothing could be better than when two

> live in one house, their minds in harmony,

> husband and wife. Their enemies are jealous,

> their friends delighted, and they have great honor."

> Then white-armed Nausicaa replied, "Well, stranger,

> you seem a brave and clever man; you know

> that Zeus apportions happiness to people,

> to good and bad, each one as he decides.

> Your troubles come from him, and you must bear them.[ 190]{.calibre4}

> But since you have arrived here in our land,

> you will not lack for clothes or anything

> I will show you the town. The people here

> And then she called her slaves with braided hair.

> "Wait, girls! Why are you running from this man?

> Do you believe he is an enemy?[ 200]{.calibre4}

> No living person ever born would come

> to our Phaeacia with a hostile mind,

> since we are much beloved by the gods.

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> > > > > So they withdrew, and told

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> "Now listen to me, girls! The gods who live[ 240]{.calibre4}

> Before, he looked so poor and unrefined;

> I hope I get a man like this as husband,

> a man that lives here and would like to stay.

> But, girls, now give the stranger food and drink!"

> She gave her orders and the girls obeyed---

> they gave Odysseus some food and drink.

> He wolfed the food and drank. He was half starved;[ 250]{.calibre4}

> it had been ages since he tasted food.

> Then white-armed Nausicaa had formed a plan.

> Folding the clothes, she packed them in the wagon,

> and yoked the mules, and then she climbed inside.

> She gave Odysseus some clear instructions.

> "Stranger, get ready; you must go to town,

> and I will have you meet the best of all

> our people. You seem smart; do as I say.

> While we are passing through the fields and farmlands,

> you have to follow quickly with the girls[ 260]{.calibre4}

> behind the mules, and let me lead the way.

> Then we will reach the lofty city wall,

> which has a scenic port on either side,

> and one slim gate, where curved ships are drawn up

> along the road: a special spot for each.

> The meeting place surrounds Poseidon's shrine,

> fitted with heavy stones set deep in earth.

> And there the workers make the ships' equipment---

> cables and sails---and there they plane the oars.

> Phaeacians do not care for archery;[ 270]{.calibre4}

> their passion is for sails and oars and ships,

> on which they love to cross the dark-gray ocean.

> The people in the town are proud; I worry

> that they may speak against me. Someone rude

> may say, 'Who is that big strong man with her?

> Where did she find that stranger? Will he be

> her husband? She has got him from a ship,

> a foreigner, since no one lives near here,

> or else a god, the answer to her prayers,

> descended from the sky to hold her tight.[ 280]{.calibre4}

> Better if she has found herself a man

> from elsewhere, since she scorns the people here,

> although she has so many noble suitors.'

> So they will shame me. I myself would blame

> a girl who got too intimate with men

> before her marriage, and who went against

> her loving parents' rules. But listen, stranger,

> I will explain the quickest way to gain

> my father's help to make your way back home.

> Beside the road there is a grove of poplars;[ 290]{.calibre4}

> it has a fountain, and a meadow round it.

> It is Athena's place, where Father has

> his orchard and estate, as far from town

> as human voice can carry. Sit down there

> and wait until I reach my father's house

> in town. But when you think I have arrived,

> walk on and ask directions for the palace

> of King Alcinous, my mighty father.

> It will be very easy finding it;

> a tiny child could guide you there. It is[ 300]{.calibre4}

> unlike the other houses in Phaeacia.

> Go through the courtyard, in the house and on

> straight to the Great Hall. You will find my mother

> sitting beside the hearth by firelight,

> and spinning her amazing purple wool.

> She leans against a pillar, slaves behind her.

> My father has a throne right next to hers;

> to supplicate. If you do this, you quickly[ 310]{.calibre4}

> will reach your home, however far it is,

> in happiness. If she is good to you,

> and looks upon you kindly in her heart,

> back to your family and native land."

> With that, she used her shining whip to urge

> the mules to go. They left the river streams,

> and trotted well and clipped their hooves along.

> She drove an easy pace to let her slaves

> and great Odysseus keep up on foot. [ 320]{.calibre4}

> Meanwhile, the fine strong mules conveyed the girl

> Her brothers gathered round her like immortals.

> They took the harness off the mules and brought

> When he had almost reached the lovely city,

> bright-eyed Athena met him, like a girl,

> > "Child, would you escort me to the house

> He was amazed to see the ships and harbors

> and meeting places of the noblemen,

> and high walls set with stakes on top---a wonder!

> They reached the splendid palace of the king.

> Divine Athena winked at him and said,

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> "Here, Mr. Foreigner, this is the house

> find them, the king and queen, inside at dinner. [ 50]{.calibre4}

> Do not be scared; go in. The brave succeed

> in all adventures, even those who come

> from countries far away. First greet the queen.

> Arete is her name. The king and queen

> have common ancestry---Nausithous.

> Eurymedon was long ago the king

> over the Giants, who were proud and bad.

> He killed them, his own people, and then he

> got killed as well. His youngest daughter was

> named Periboea. She was very pretty.[ 60]{.calibre4}

> Poseidon slept with her. She had a child,

> Nausithous, and he became the king

> here in Phaeacia, and he had two sons,

> our King Alcinous, and Rhexenor.

> Apollo shot that Rhexenor when he

> was newly married, with no son. He left

> a daughter, our Arete, and her uncle,

> Alcinous, made her his wife. No woman

> is honored as he honors her. She is

> precious to him, her children, and the people.[ 70]{.calibre4}

> We look at her as if she were a goddess,

> and point her out when she walks through our town.

> She is extremely clever and perceptive;

> she solves disputes to help the men she likes.

> If she looks on you kindly in her heart,

> you have a chance of seeing those you love,

> and getting back again to your big house

> > > > > So bright-eyed Athena left him.

> She went from lovely Scheria, across

> the tireless sea, to Marathon and Athens,[ 80]{.calibre4}

> and went inside Erechtheus' palace.

> Odysseus approached the royal house,

> and stood there by the threshold made of bronze.

> His heart was mulling over many things.

> The palace of the mighty king was high,

> and shone like rays of sunlight or of moonlight.

> The walls were bronze all over, from the entrance

> back to the bedrooms, and along them ran

> a frieze of blue. Gold doors held safe the house.

> Pillars of silver rose up from the threshold, [ 90]{.calibre4}

> the lintel silver, and the handle, gold.

> Silver and golden dogs stood at each side,

> made by Hephaestus with great artistry,

> to guard the home of brave Alcinous---

> immortal dogs, unaging for all time.

> At intervals were seats set in the walls,

> right from the doorway to the inner rooms,

> with soft embroidered throws, the work of women.

> Phaeacian lords and ladies sat upon them,

> eating and drinking, since they lacked for nothing. [ 100]{.calibre4}

> Boys made of gold were set on pedestals,

> and they held burning torches in their hands,

> lighting the hall at night for those at dinner.

> The King had fifty slave girls in his house;

> some ground the yellow grain upon the millstone,

> others wove cloth and sat there spinning yarn,

> with fingers quick as rustling poplar leaves,

> and oil was dripping from the woven fabric.

> Just as Phaeacian men have special talent

> for launching ships to sea, the women there[ 110]{.calibre4}

> are expert weavers, since Athena gave them

> fine minds and skill to make most lovely things.

> Outside the courtyard by the doors there grows

> an orchard of four acres, hedged around.

> The trees are tall, luxuriant with fruit:

> bright-colored apples, pears and pomegranate,

> sweet figs and fertile olives, and the crop

> never runs out or withers in the winter,

> nor in the summer. Fruit grows all year round.

> The West Wind always blows and makes it swell[ 120]{.calibre4}

> and ripen: mellowing pear on mellowing pear,

> apple on apple, grapes on grapes, and figs.

> A fertile vineyard too is planted there.

> They use the warmer side, a flattened slope,

> for drying grapes in sunshine. They pick bunches

> and trample them, while unripe clusters open

> and shed their blooms, and others turn to purple.

> There are two springs: one flows all through the garden,

> the other gushes from the courtyard threshold,

> towards the palace, and the people draw[ 130]{.calibre4}

> freshwater. So the gods had blessed the house

> of King Alcinous with lovely gifts.

> Hardened, long-suffering Odysseus

> stood there and stared, astonished in his heart,

> then quickly strode across the palace threshold.

> He found the lordly leaders of Phaeacia

> pouring drink offerings for sharp-eyed Hermes,

> to whom they give libations before bed.

> Odysseus went in the house disguised

> in mist with which Athena covered him, [ 140]{.calibre4}

> until he reached Arete and the king.

> He threw his arms around Arete's knees,

> and all at once, the magic mist dispersed.

> They were astonished when they saw the man,

> and all fell silent. Then Odysseus

> said,

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> > "Queen Arete, child of Rhexenor,

> I have had many years of pain and loss.

> I beg you, and your husband, and these men

> who feast here---may the gods bless you in life,

> and may you leave your children wealth and honor.[ 150]{.calibre4}

> Now help me, please, to get back home, and quickly!

> I miss my family. I have been gone

> so long it hurts."

> > > > > He sat down by the hearth

> He was an elder statesman of Phaeacia,

> Wanting to help, he said,

> > > > > > "Alcinous,

> you know it is not right to leave a stranger

> sitting there on the floor beside the hearth[ 160]{.calibre4}

> among the cinders. Everyone is waiting

> for you to give the word. Make him get up,

> and seat him on a silver chair, and order

> The house girl ought to bring the stranger food

> > > > > > So Alcinous

> He made Laodamas, his favorite son,[ 170]{.calibre4}

> vacate his chair so he could sit beside him.

> The slave girl brought him water in a pitcher

> of gold to wash his hands, and poured it out

> over a silver bowl, and fetched a table

> of polished wood; a humble slave brought out

> Half-starved and weak, the hero ate and drank.

> Majestic King Alcinous addressed

> Pontonous, the wine boy.

> > > > > > "Go and mix

> a bowl and serve the wine to all our guests,[ 180]{.calibre4}

> so we may offer drink to thundering Zeus

> the sweet, delicious wine, and filled the cups

> for everyone, with first pour for the gods.

> They made the offerings and drank as much

> said,

> > "Listen, lords. Hear what my heart commands.

> The feast is over; go home, go to bed.

> At dawn, we will call more of our best men,

> and host the stranger in our halls, and offer[ 190]{.calibre4}

> fine sacrifices to the gods, then plan

> how we may help his journey, so our guest

> may travel quickly, without pain or trouble,

> encountering no trouble on the way,

> however far away it is, until

> whatever was spun out when he was born

> by Fate and by the heavy ones, the Spinners.

> But if he is immortal, come from heaven,

> the gods have changed their ways, since in the past[ 200]{.calibre4}

> they used to show themselves to us directly

> whenever we would give them hecatombs.

> They sit and eat among us. Even if

> just one of us meets them alone, out walking,

> they do not hide from us; we are close friends,

> as are the Giants and Cyclopic peoples."

> Odysseus, with careful calculation,

> said,

> > "No, Alcinous, please think again.

> I am not like the deathless gods in heaven.

> My height is normal. I look like a human. [ 210]{.calibre4}

> In pain I am a match for any man,

> whoever you may know that suffers most.

> I could tell many stories of the dangers

> that I have suffered through; gods willed it so.

> But let me have my meal, despite my grief.

> The belly is just like a whining dog:

> it begs and forces one to notice it,

> despite exhaustion or the depths of sorrow.

> My heart is full of sorrow, but my stomach

> is always telling me to eat and drink. [ 220]{.calibre4}

> It tells me to forget what I have suffered,

> and fill it up. At dawn tomorrow, help me

> to reach my homeland, after all this pain.

> May I live out my final days in sight

> of my own property and slaves and home."

> They all agreed the stranger's words made sense,

> and that he should be sent back home. They poured

> drink offerings to the gods, and drank as much

> as they desired, then all went home to bed.

> Odysseus was left there in the hall,[ 230]{.calibre4}

> sitting beside Arete and the godlike

> Alcinous. The dishes from the feast

> were cleaned up by the slaves. White-armed Arete

> had noticed his fine clothes, the cloak and shirt

> she wove herself, with help from her slave girls.

> Her words flew out to him as if on wings.

> "Stranger, let me be first to speak to you.

> Where are you from? And who gave you those clothes?

> I thought you said you drifted here by sea?"

> Planning his words with careful skill, he answered,[ 240]{.calibre4}

> "It would be difficult, Your Majesty,

> to tell it all; the gods have given me

> so many troubles. I will tell you this.

> There is an island, far out in the sea,

> Ogygia, where the child of Atlas lives,

> the mighty goddess with smooth braids, the crafty

> Calypso, friend to neither gods nor mortals.

> A spirit brought me to her hearth, alone,

> when Zeus scooped up my ship and with bright lightning

> split it apart across the wine-dark sea.[ 250]{.calibre4}

> All of my comrades, my brave friends, were killed.

> I wrapped my arms around the keel and floated

> for ten days. On the tenth black night, the gods

> carried me till I reached Ogygia,

> home of the beautiful and mighty goddess

> Calypso. Lovingly she cared for me,

> vowing to set me free from death and time

> forever. But she never swayed my heart.

> I stayed for seven years; she gave me clothes

> like those of gods, but they were always wet[ 260]{.calibre4}

> with tears. At last the eighth year rolled around,

> and word came down from Zeus that I must go,

> and finally her mind was changed. She sent me

> upon a well-bound wooden raft, equipped

> with food, sweet wine, and clothes as if for gods,

> and sent a fair warm wind. I sailed the sea

> for seventeen long days; on day eighteen,

> the murky mountains of your land appeared,

> and I was overjoyed, but more bad luck

> was hurled at me. Poseidon roused the winds[ 270]{.calibre4}

> to block me, and he stirred the sea. I sobbed,

> and clung there, going nowhere, till my raft

> was smashed to pieces by the massive storm.

> But I swam through this gulf of water till

> the current brought me here. If I had tried

> to land at once, I would have been swept back

> against the crags. I swam a way away,

> until I reached a river mouth, which seemed

> a perfect spot for landing: it was sheltered

> from wind, and smooth, quite free from rocks. So there [ 280]{.calibre4}

> I flopped and tried to gather up my strength

> until the holy nightfall. Then I crawled

> out of the rain-fed river to the bank,

> and hid inside the bushes, and I heaped

> some leaves to cover me. Some god poured down

> deep sleep. With heavy heart I slept all night

> and through the dawn to noon, beneath the leaves.

> Then in the afternoon, when sleep released me,

> I woke, and saw girls playing on the beach---

> your daughter, like a goddess, and her slaves.[ 290]{.calibre4}

> I prayed to her. One would not think a girl

> as young as her would have so much good sense;

> young people are not usually so thoughtful.

[[The Songs of a Poet]{.calibre6}](#index_split_005.html_filepos3346)

> Soon Dawn appeared and touched the sky with roses.

> Majestic, holy King Alcinous

> leapt out of bed, as did Odysseus,

> the city-sacker. Then the blessed king,

> mighty Alcinous, led out his guest

> to the Phaeacian council by the ships.

> They sat there side by side on polished stones.

> Meanwhile, Athena walked all through the town,

> appearing like the royal messenger.

> To help Odysseus' journey home, [ 10]{.calibre4}

> she stood beside each man in turn and said,

> "My lord, come to the meeting place, to learn

> about the visitor to our king's home.

> Despite his wanderings by sea, he looks

> like an immortal god."

> > > > > > So she roused up

> the hearts and minds of each, and soon the seats

> of council were filled up; the men assembled.

> Seeing Laertes' clever son, the crowd

> marveled. Athena poured unearthly charm

> upon his head and shoulders, and she made him [ 20]{.calibre4}

> taller and sturdier, so these Phaeacians

> would welcome and respect him, when he managed

> the many trials of skill that they would set

> to test him. When the people were assembled,

> Alcinous addressed them.

> > > > > > "Hear me, leaders

> and chieftains of Phaeacia. I will tell you

> the promptings of my heart. This foreigner---

> I do not know his name---came wandering

> from west or east and showed up at my house.

> He begs and prays for help to travel on. [ 30]{.calibre4}

> Let us assist him, as we have before

> with other guests: no visitor has ever

> been forced to linger in my house. We always

> give them safe passage home. Now let us launch

> a ship for her maiden voyage on the water,

> and choose a crew of fifty-two, the men

> selected as the best, and lash the oars

> beside the benches. Then return to shore,

> and come to my house. Let the young men hurry

> to cook a feast. I will provide supplies,[ 40]{.calibre4}

> plenty for everyone. And I invite

> you also, lords, to welcome him with me.

> Do not refuse! We also must invite

> Demodocus, the poet. Gods inspire him,

> so any song he chooses to perform

> is wonderful to hear."

> > > > > > He led the way.

> The lords went with him, and the house boy fetched

> the bard. The fifty-two select young men

> went to the shore, just as the king commanded.

> They reached the restless salty sea, and launched[ 50]{.calibre4}

> the black ship on the depths, set up the mast

> and sails, and fastened in the oars, by tying

> each to its leather thole-strap, all in order.

> They spread the white sails wide, and moored the ship

> out in the water. Then the men walked up

> towards the mighty palace of the king.

> The halls and porticoes were thronged with people,

> both old and young. To feed his many guests

> Alcinous killed twelve sheep, and eight boars

> with silver tusks, and two slow-lumbering cows.[ 60]{.calibre4}

> Skinning the animals, they cooked a feast.

> The house boy brought the poet, whom the Muse

> adored. She gave him two gifts, good and bad:

> she took his sight away, but gave sweet song.

> The wine boy brought a silver-studded chair

> and propped it by a pillar, in the middle

> of all the guests, and by a peg he hung

> the poet's lyre above his head and helped him

> to reach it, and he set a table by him,

> and a bread basket and a cup of wine[ 70]{.calibre4}

> to drink whenever he desired. They all

> took food. When they were satisfied, the Muse

> prompted the bard to sing of famous actions,

> an episode whose fame has touched the sky:

> Achilles' and Odysseus' quarrel---

> how at a splendid sacrificial feast,

> they argued bitterly, and Agamemnon

> was glad because the best of the Achaeans

> were quarreling, since when he had consulted

> the oracle at Pytho, crossing over[ 80]{.calibre4}

> the entry stone, Apollo had foretold

> that this would be the start of suffering

> for Greeks and Trojans, through the plans of Zeus.

> So sang the famous bard. Odysseus

> with his strong hands picked up his heavy cloak

> of purple, and he covered up his face.

> He was ashamed to let them see him cry.

> Each time the singer paused, Odysseus

> wiped tears, drew down the cloak and poured a splash

> of wine out of his goblet, for the gods.[ 90]{.calibre4}

> But each time, the Phaeacian nobles urged

> the bard to sing again---they loved his songs.

> So he would start again; Odysseus

> would moan and hide his head beneath his cloak.

> Only Alcinous could see his tears,

> since he was sitting next to him, and heard

> his sobbing. So he quickly spoke.

> > > > > > "My lords!

> We have already satisfied our wish

> for feasting, and the lyre, the feast's companion.

> Now let us go outside and set up contests[ 100]{.calibre4}

> in every sport, so when our guest goes home

> he can tell all his friends we are the best

> at boxing, wrestling, high-jumping, and sprinting."

> With that he led the way; the others followed.

> The boy took down the lyre from its peg

> and took Demodocus' hand to lead him

> out with the crowd who went to watch the games.

> Many young athletes stood there: Acroneüs,

> Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,

> Thoön, Anchialus, Eretmeus, [ 110]{.calibre4}

> Anabesineus and Ponteus,

> Prymneus, Proreus, Amphialus,

> the son of Polynaus, son of Tecton,

> and Naubolus' son, Euryalus,

> like Ares, cause of ruin. In his looks

> and strength, he was the best in all Phaeacia,

> after Laodamas. Three sons of great

> Alcinous stood up: Laodamas,

> godlike Clytoneus, and Halius.

> First came the footrace. They lined up, then dashed [ 120]{.calibre4}

> all in an instant, right around the track

> so fast they raised the dust up from the field.

> Clytoneus was the best by far at sprinting:

> he raced past all the others by the length

> of a field plowed by mules, and reached the crowd.

> Next came the brutal sport of wrestling,

> in which Euryalus was best. In jumping,

> Amphialus excelled. And at the discus,

> by far the best of all was Elatreus.

> The prince Laodamas excelled at boxing. [ 130]{.calibre4}

> They all enjoyed the games. When they were over,

> Laodamas, Alcinous' son,

> said,

> > "Now my friends, we ought to ask the stranger

> if he plays any sports. His build is strong;

> his legs and arms and neck are very sturdy,

> and he is in his prime, though he has been

> broken by suffering. No pain can shake

> a man as badly as the sea, however

> strong he once was."

> > > > > > Euryalus replied,

> "You are quite right, Laodamas. Why not[ 140]{.calibre4}

> call out to challenge him yourself?"

> > > > > > The noble

> son of Alcinous agreed with him.

> He stood up in the middle of them all

> and called Odysseus.

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> > > > > > "Come here!" he said.

> "Now you, sir! You should try our games as well,

> if you know any sports; it seems you would.

> Nothing can be more glorious for a man,

> in a whole lifetime, than what he achieves

> with hands and feet. So try, set care aside.

> Soon you will travel, since your ship is launched.[ 150]{.calibre4}

> The crew is standing by."

> > > > > > Odysseus

> thought carefully---he had a plan. He answered,

> "Laodamas, why mock me with this challenge?

> My heart is set on sorrow, not on games,

> since I have suffered and endured so much

> that now I only want to get back home.

> I sit here praying to your king and people

> to grant my wish."

> > > > > Euryalus responded

> with outright taunting.

> > > > > > "Stranger, I suppose

> you must be ignorant of all athletics.[ 160]{.calibre4}

> I know your type. The captain of a crew

> of merchant sailors, you roam round at sea

> and only care about your freight and cargo,

> keeping close watch on your ill-gotten gains.

> You are no athlete."

> > > > > > With a scowl, he answered,

> "What crazy arrogance from you, you stranger!

> The gods do not bless everyone the same,

> with equal gifts of body, mind, or speech.

> One man is weak, but gods may crown his words

> with loveliness. Men gladly look to him;[ 170]{.calibre4}

> his speech is steady, with calm dignity.

> He stands out from his audience, and when

> he walks through town, the people look at him

> as if he were a god. Another man

> has godlike looks but no grace in his words.

> Like you---you look impressive, and a god

> could not improve your body. But your mind

> is crippled. You have stirred my heart to anger

> with these outrageous comments. I am not

> lacking experience of sports and games.[ 180]{.calibre4}

> When I was young, I trusted my strong arms

> and was among the first. Now pain has crushed me.

> I have endured the agonies of war,

> and struggled through the dangers of the sea.

> But you have challenged me and stung my heart.

> Despite my suffering, I will compete."

> With that he leapt up, cloak and all, and seized

> a massive discus, heavier than that

> used by the others. He spun around, drew back

> his arm and from his brawny hand he hurled.[ 190]{.calibre4}

> The stone went humming. The Phaeacians, known

> for rowing, ducked down cowering beneath

> its arc; it flew beyond the other pegs.

> Athena marked the spot. In human guise

> she spoke.

> > > "A blind man, stranger, could discern

> this mark by groping. It is far ahead

> of all the others. You can celebrate!

> You won this round, and none of them will ever

> throw further---or as far!"

> > > > > > Odysseus

> was thrilled to realize he had a friend[ 200]{.calibre4}

> to take his side, and with a lighter heart,

> he told the young Phaeacians,

> > > > > > "Try to match this!

> If you can do it, I will throw another,

> as far or farther. You have made me angry,

> so I will take you on in any sport.

> Come on! In boxing, wrestling, or sprinting,

> I will compete with anyone, except

> Laodamas: he is my host. Who would

> fight with a friend? A man who challenges

> those who have welcomed him in a strange land[ 210]{.calibre4}

> is worthless and a fool; he spites himself.

> But I will challenge any of you others.

> Test my ability, let me know yours.

> I am not weak at any sport men practice.

> I know the way to hold a polished bow.

> I always was the first to hit my man

> out of a horde of enemies, though many

> comrades stood by me, arrows taking aim.

> At Troy, when the Achaeans shot their bows,

> the only one superior to me[ 220]{.calibre4}

> was Philoctetes. Other men who eat

> their bread on earth are all worse shots than me.

> But I will not compete with super-archers,

> with Heracles or Eurytus, who risked

> competing with the gods at archery.

> Apollo was enraged at him and killed him

> as soon as he proposed it. He died young

> and did not reach old age in his own home.

> And I can throw a spear beyond the shots

> that others reach with arrows. I am only[ 230]{.calibre4}

> concerned that one of you may win the footrace:

> I lost my stamina and my legs weakened

> during my time at sea, upon the raft;

> I could not do my exercise routine."

> The crowd was silent, but Alcinous

> said, "Sir, you have expressed, with fine good manners,

> your wish to show your talents, and your anger

> at that man who stood up in this arena

> and mocked you, as no one who understands

> how to speak properly would ever do.[ 240]{.calibre4}

> Now listen carefully, so you may tell

> your own fine friends at home when you are feasting

> beside your wife and children, and remember

> our skill in all the deeds we have accomplished

> from our forefathers' time till now. We are

> not brilliant at wrestling or boxing,

> but we are quick at sprinting, and with ships

> we are the best. We love the feast, the lyre,

> dancing and varied clothes, hot baths and bed.

> But now let the best dancers of Phaeacia[ 250]{.calibre4}

> perform, so that our guest may tell his friends

> when he gets home, how excellent we are

> at seafaring, at running, and at dancing

> and song. Let someone bring the well-tuned lyre

> from inside for Demodocus---go quickly!"

> So spoke the king. The house boy brought the lyre.

> The people chose nine referees to check

> the games were fair. They leveled out a floor

> for dancing, with a fine wide ring around.

> The house boy gave Demodocus the lyre. [ 260]{.calibre4}

> He walked into the middle, flanked by boys,

> young and well trained, who tapped their feet performing

> the holy dance, their quick legs bright with speed.

> Odysseus was wonder-struck to see it.

> The poet strummed and sang a charming song

> about the love of fair-crowned Aphrodite

> for Ares, who gave lavish gifts to her

> and shamed the bed of Lord Hephaestus, where

> they secretly had sex. The Sun God saw them,

> and told Hephaestus---bitter news for him. [ 270]{.calibre4}

> He marched into his forge to get revenge,

> and set the mighty anvil on its block,

> and hammered chains so strong that they could never

> be broken or undone. He was so angry

> at Ares. When his trap was made, he went

> inside the room of his beloved bed,

> and twined the mass of cables all around

> the bedposts, and then hung them from the ceiling,

> like slender spiderwebs, so finely made

> that nobody could see them, even gods:[ 280]{.calibre4}

> the craftsmanship was so ingenious.

> When he had set that trap across the bed,

> he traveled to the cultured town of Lemnos,

> which was his favorite place in all the world.

> Ares the golden rider had kept watch.

> He saw Hephaestus, famous wonder-worker,

> leaving his house, and went inside himself;

> he wanted to make love with Aphrodite.

> She had returned from visiting her father,

> the mighty son of Cronus; there she sat.[ 290]{.calibre4}

> Then Ares took her hand and said to her,

> "My darling, let us go to bed. Hephaestus

> is out of town; he must have gone to Lemnos

> to see the Sintians whose speech is strange."

> She was excited to lie down with him;

> they went to bed together. But the chains

> ingenious Hephaestus had created

> wrapped tight around them, so they could not move

> or get up. Then they knew that they were trapped.

> The limping god drew near---before he reached[ 300]{.calibre4}

> the land of Lemnos, he had turned back home.

> Troubled at heart, he came towards his house.

> Standing there in the doorway, he was seized

> by savage rage. He gave a mighty shout,

> calling to all the gods,

> > > > > > "O Father Zeus,

> and all you blessed gods who live forever,

> look! You may laugh, but it is hard to bear.

> See how my Aphrodite, child of Zeus,

> is disrespecting me for being lame.

> She loves destructive Ares, who is strong[ 310]{.calibre4}

> and handsome. I am weak. I blame my parents.

> If only I had not been born! But come,

> see where those two are sleeping in my bed,

> as lovers. I am horrified to see it.

> But I predict they will not want to lie

> longer like that, however great their love.

> Soon they will want to wake up, but my trap

> and chains will hold them fast, until her father

> pays back the price I gave him for his daughter.

> Her eyes stare at me like a dog. She is[ 320]{.calibre4}

> so beautiful, but lacking self-control."

> The gods assembled at his house: Poseidon,

> Earth-Shaker, helpful Hermes, and Apollo.

> The goddesses stayed home, from modesty.

> The blessed gods who give good things were standing

> inside the doorway, and they burst out laughing,

> at what a clever trap Hephaestus set.

> And as they looked, they said to one another,

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> "Crime does not pay! The slow can beat the quick,

> as now Hephaestus, who is lame and slow,[ 330]{.calibre4}

> has used his skill to catch the fastest sprinter

> of all those on Olympus. Ares owes

> the price for his adultery." They gossiped.

> Apollo, son of Zeus, then said to Hermes,

> "Hermes my brother, would you like to sleep

> with golden Aphrodite, in her bed,

> even weighed down by mighty chains?"

> > > > > > And Hermes

> the sharp-eyed messenger replied, "Ah, brother,

> Apollo lord of archery: if only!

> I would be bound three times as tight or more[ 340]{.calibre4}

> and let you gods and all your wives look on,

> if only I could sleep with Aphrodite."

> Then laughter rose among the deathless gods.

> Only Poseidon did not laugh. He begged

> and pleaded with Hephaestus to release

> Ares. He told the wonder-working god,

> "Now let him go! I promise he will pay

> the penalty in full among the gods,

> just as you ask."

> > > > > The famous limping god

> replied, "Poseidon, do not ask me this.[ 350]{.calibre4}

> It is disgusting, bailing scoundrels out.

> How could I bind you, while the gods look on,

> if Ares should escape his bonds and debts?"

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> Poseidon, Lord of Earthquakes, answered him,

> "Hephaestus, if he tries to dodge this debt,

> I promise I will pay."

> > > > > > The limping god

> said, "Then, in courtesy to you, I must

> do as you ask." So using all his strength,

> Hephaestus loosed the chains. The pair of lovers

> were free from their constraints, and both jumped up. [ 360]{.calibre4}

> Ares went off to Thrace, while Aphrodite

> smiled as she went to Cyprus, to the island

> of Paphos, where she had a fragrant altar

> and sanctuary. The Graces washed her there,

> and rubbed her with the magic oil that glows

> upon immortals, and they dressed her up

> in gorgeous clothes. She looked astonishing.

> That was the poet's song. Odysseus

> was happy listening; so were they all.

> And then Alcinous told Halius [ 370]{.calibre4}

> to dance with Laodamas; no one danced

> as well as them. They took a purple ball

> which Polybus the artisan had made them.

> One boy would leap and toss it to the clouds;

> the other would jump up, feet off the ground,

> and catch it easily before he landed.

> After they practiced throwing it straight upwards,

> they danced across the fertile earth, crisscrossing,

> constantly trading places. Other boys

> who stood around the field were beating time[ 380]{.calibre4}

> with noisy stomping. Then Odysseus

> said,

> > "King of many citizens, great lord,

> you boasted that your dancers are the best,

> and it is true. I feel amazed to see

> this marvelous show."

> > > > > > That pleased the reverend king.

> He spoke at once to his seafaring people.

> "Hear me, Phaeacian leaders, lords and nobles.

> The stranger seems extremely wise to me.

> So let us give him gifts, as hosts should do

> to guests in friendship. Twelve lords rule our people,[ 390]{.calibre4}

> with me as thirteenth lord. Let us each bring

> a pound of precious gold and laundered clothes,

> a tunic and a cloak. Then pile them up,

> and let our guest take all these gifts, and go

> to dinner with them, happy in his heart.

> Euryalus should tell him he is sorry,

> and give a special gift, since what he said

> was inappropriate."

> > > > > They all agreed,

> and each sent back a deputy to fetch

> the presents. And Euryalus spoke out.[ 400]{.calibre4}

> "My lord Alcinous, great king of kings,

> I will apologize, as you command.

> And I will give him this bronze sword which has

> a silver handle, and a scabbard carved

> of ivory---a precious gift for him."

> With that he put the silver-studded sword

> into Odysseus' hands; his words

> flew out.

> > > "I welcome you, sir. Be our guest.

> If something rude of any kind was said,

> let the winds take it. May the gods allow you[ 410]{.calibre4}

> to reach your home and see your wife again,

> since you have suffered so long, far away

> from those who love you."

> > > > > > And Odysseus

> said, "Friend, I wish you well. May gods protect you,

> and may you never miss the sword you gave me."

> With that, he strapped the silver-studded sword

> across his back, and as the sun went down

> the precious gifts were brought to him. The slaves

> took them inside Alcinous' house.

> The princes piled the lovely things beside[ 420]{.calibre4}

> the queen, their mother. King Alcinous

> led everyone inside and had them sit

> on upright chairs. He told Arete,

> > > > > > "Wife,

> bring out our finest chest, and put inside it

> a tunic and a freshly laundered cloak.

> Set a bronze cauldron on the fire to boil,

> so he can take a bath. Then let him see

> the precious gifts our noblemen have brought,

> and then enjoy the banquet and the song.

> I also have a gift: a splendid cup[ 430]{.calibre4}

> of gold. I hope he always thinks of me

> whenever he pours offerings to Zeus

> and other gods."

> > > > > Arete told her slaves

> to quickly set a mighty pot to warm,

> for washing. So upon the blazing flames

> they set the cauldron and poured water in,

> and heaped up wood. The fire licked around

> the belly of the tub and warmed the water.

> Arete brought from her own room a chest

> to give the guest, and packed the gifts inside---[ 440]{.calibre4}

> the clothes and gold that they had given him;

> and she herself put in a cloak and tunic.

> She told him,

> > > > "Watch the lid, and tie it closed,

> so nobody can rob you as you travel,

> when you are lulled to sleep on your black ship."

> Odysseus, experienced in loss,

> took careful note. He shut the lid and tied

> a cunning knot that he had learned from Circe.

> Then right away the slave girl led him off

> towards the bath to wash. He was delighted[ 450]{.calibre4}

> to see hot water. He had not been bathed

> since he had left the home of curly-haired

> Calypso, who had taken care of him

> as if he were a god. The slave girls washed him,

> rubbed oil on him and dressed him in a tunic

> and fine wool mantle. Freshly bathed, he joined

> the men at wine. And there stood Nausicaa,

> divinely beautiful, beside a pillar

> that held the palace roof. She was amazed

> to see Odysseus. Her words flew fast.[ 460]{.calibre4}

> "Good-bye then, stranger, but remember me

> when you reach home, because you owe your life

> > > > > > Odysseus

> husband of Hera, mighty Lord of Thunder,

> allow me to go back and see my home.

> There I shall pray to you as to a god,

> forever, princess, since you saved my life."

> With that he went to sit beside the king.

> Now they were serving out the food and pouring[ 470]{.calibre4}

> wine, and the steward led out to the center

> Demodocus, the well-respected poet.

> He sat him in the middle of the banquet,

> against a pillar. Then Odysseus

> had plenty left. He told the boy,

> > > > > > "Go take

> Despite my grief, I would be glad to meet him.

> Poets are honored by all those who live[ 480]{.calibre4}

> > > > > > So the house boy

> > "You are wonderful, Demodocus!

> I praise you more than anyone; Apollo,

> or else the Muse, the child of Zeus, has taught you.

> You tell so accurately what the Greeks[ 490]{.calibre4}

> as if you had been there, or heard about it

> from somebody who was. So sing the story

> built with Athena's help. Odysseus

> dragged it inside and to the citadel,

> filled up with men to sack the town. If you

> A god inspired the bard to sing. He started[ 500]{.calibre4}

> with how the Greeks set fire to their camp

> and then embarked and sailed away. Meanwhile,

> Odysseus brought in a gang of men

> into the heart of Troy, inside the horse.

> The Trojans pulled the thing up to the summit,

> Some said, "We ought to strike the wood with swords!"

> Others said, "Drag it higher up and hurl it

> to pacify the gods. So it would be. [ 510]{.calibre4}

> The town was doomed to ruin when it took

> that horse, chock-full of fighters bringing death

> to Trojans. And he sang how the Achaeans

> poured from the horse, in ambush from the hollow,

> and sacked the city; how they scattered out,

> destroying every neighborhood. Like Ares,

> Odysseus, with Menelaus, rushed

> to find Deiphobus' house, and there

> he won at last, through dreadful violence,

> thanks to Athena. So the poet sang.[ 520]{.calibre4}

> Odysseus was melting into tears;

> his cheeks were wet with weeping, as a woman

> weeps, as she falls to wrap her arms around

> her husband, fallen fighting for his home

> and children. She is watching as he gasps

> and dies. She shrieks, a clear high wail, collapsing

> upon his corpse. The men are right behind.

> They hit her shoulders with their spears and lead her

> to slavery, hard labor, and a life

> of pain. Her face is marked with her despair.[ 530]{.calibre4}

> In that same desperate way, Odysseus

> was crying. No one noticed that his eyes

> were wet with tears, except Alcinous,

> who sat right next to him and heard his sobs.

> Quickly he spoke to his seafaring people.

> "Listen, my lords and nobles of Phaeacia!

> Demodocus should stop and set aside

> the lyre, since what he sings does not give pleasure

> to everyone. Throughout this heavenly song,

> since dinnertime, our guest has been in pain,[ 540]{.calibre4}

> grieving. A heavy burden weighs his heart.

> Let the song end, so we can all be happy,

> both guest and hosts. That would be best by far.

> This send-off party and these precious gifts,

> which we give out of friendship, are for him,

> our guest of honor. Any man of sense

> will treat a guest in need like his own brother.

> Stranger, now answer all my questions clearly,

> not with evasion; frankness would be best.

> To me this seems ideal, a thing of beauty.

> Where shall I start? Where can I end? The gods

> have given me so much to cry about.

> First I will tell my name, so we will be

> acquainted and if I survive, you can

> be my guest in my distant home one day.

> I am Odysseus, Laertes' son, [ 20]{.calibre4}

> known for my many clever tricks and lies.

> My fame extends to heaven, but I live

> in Ithaca, where shaking forest hides

> Mount Neriton. Close by are other islands:

> Dulichium, and wooded Zacynthus

> and Same. All the others face the dawn;

> my Ithaca is set apart, most distant,

> facing the dark. It is a rugged land,

> but good at raising children. To my eyes

> no country could be sweeter. As you know,[ 30]{.calibre4}

> divine Calpyso held me in her cave,

> wanting to marry me; and likewise Circe,

> the trickster, trapped me, and she wanted me

> to be her husband. But she never swayed

> my heart, since when a man is far from home,

> living abroad, there is no sweeter thing

> than his own native land and family.

> Now let me tell you all the trouble Zeus

> has caused me on my journey home from Troy.

> A blast of wind pushed me off course towards[ 40]{.calibre4}

> the Cicones in Ismarus. I sacked

> the town and killed the men. We took their wives

> and shared their riches equally among us.

> Then I said we must run away. Those fools

> refused to listen. They were drinking wine

> excessively, and killing sheep and cattle

> along the beach. The Cicones called out

> to neighbors on the mainland, who were strong

> and numerous, and skilled at horseback fighting,

> and if need be, on foot. They came like leaves[ 50]{.calibre4}

> and blossoms in the spring at dawn. Then Zeus

> gave us bad luck. Poor us! The enemy

> assembled round the ships and fought with swords

> of bronze. And while the holy morning light

> was bright and strong, we held them off, though they

> outnumbered us. But when the sun turned round

> and dipped, the hour when oxen are released,

> the Cicones began to overpower

> us Greeks. Six well-armed members of my crew

> died from each ship. The rest of us survived,[ 60]{.calibre4}

> and we escaped the danger. We prepared

> to sail away with heavy hearts, relieved

> to be alive, but grieving for our friends.

> Before we launched the ships, we called aloud

> three times to each of our poor lost companions,

> slaughtered at the hands of the Cicones.

> The Cloud Lord Zeus hurled North Wind at our ships,

> a terrible typhoon, and covered up

> the sea and earth with fog. Night fell from heaven

> and seized us and our ships keeled over sideways;[ 70]{.calibre4}

> the sails were ripped three times by blasting wind.

> Scared for our lives, we hoisted down the sails

> and rowed with all our might towards the shore.

> We stayed there for two days and nights, exhausted,

> eating our hearts with pain. When bright-haired Dawn

> brought the third morning, we set up our masts,

> unfurled the shining sails, and climbed aboard.

> The wind blew straight, the pilots steered, and I

> would have come safely home, to my own land,

> but as I rounded Malea, a current[ 80]{.calibre4}

> and blast of wind pushed me off course, away

> from Cythera. For nine days I was swept

> by stormy winds across the fish-filled sea.

> On the tenth day, I landed on the island

> of those who live on food from lotus flowers.

> We gathered water, and my crew prepared

> a meal. We picnicked by the ships, then I

> chose two men, and one slave to make the third,

> to go and scout. We needed to find out

> what kind of people lived there on that island.[ 90]{.calibre4}

> The scouts encountered humans, Lotus-Eaters,

> who did not hurt them. They just shared with them

> their sweet delicious fruit. But as they ate it,

> they lost the will to come back and bring news

> to me. They wanted only to stay there,

> feeding on lotus with the Lotus-Eaters.

> They had forgotten home. I dragged them back

> in tears, forced them on board the hollow ships,

> pushed them below the decks, and tied them up.

> I told the other men, the loyal ones,[ 100]{.calibre4}

> to get back in the ships, so no one else

> would taste the lotus and forget about

> our destination. They embarked and sat

> along the rowing benches, side by side,

> and struck the grayish water with their oars.

> With heavy hearts we sailed along and reached

> the country of high-minded Cyclopes,

> the mavericks. They put their trust in gods,

> and do not plant their food from seed, nor plow,

> and yet the barley, grain, and clustering wine-grapes[ 110]{.calibre4}

> all flourish there, increased by rain from Zeus.

> They hold no councils, have no common laws,

> but live in caves on lofty mountaintops,

> and each makes laws for his own wife and children,

> without concern for what the others think.

> A distance from this island is another,

> across the water, slantways from the harbor,

> level and thickly wooded. Countless goats

> live there but people never visit it.

> No hunters labor through its woods to scale[ 120]{.calibre4}

> its hilly peaks. There are no flocks of sheep,

> no fields of plowland---it is all untilled,

> unsown and uninhabited by humans.

> Only the bleating goats live there and graze.

> Cyclopic people have no red-cheeked ships

> and no shipwright among them who could build

> boats, to enable them to row across

> to other cities, as most people do,

> crossing the sea to visit one another.

> With boats they could have turned this island into[ 130]{.calibre4}

> a fertile colony, with proper harvests.

> By the gray shore there lie well-watered meadows,

> where vines would never fail. There is flat land

> for plowing, and abundant crops would grow

> in the autumn; there is richness underground.

> The harbor has good anchorage; there is

> no need of anchor stones or ropes or cables.

> The ships that come to shore there can remain

> beached safely till the sailors wish to leave

> and fair winds blow. Up by the harbor head[ 140]{.calibre4}

> freshwater gushes down beneath the caves.

> The poplars grow around it. There we sailed:

> the gods were guiding us all through the darkness.

> Thick fog wrapped round our ships and in the sky

> the moon was dark and clothed in clouds, so we

> saw nothing of the island. None of us

> could see the great waves rolling in towards

> the land, until we rowed right to the beach.

> We lowered all the sails and disembarked

> onto the shore, and there we fell asleep.[ 150]{.calibre4}

> When early Dawn shone forth with rosy fingers,

> we roamed around that island full of wonders.

> The daughters of the great King Zeus, the nymphs,

> drove out the mountain goats so that my crew

> could eat. On seeing them, we dashed to fetch

> our javelins and bows from on board ship.

> We split into three groups, took aim and shot.

> Some god gave us good hunting. All twelve crews

> had nine goats each, and ten for mine. We sat there

> all day till sunset, eating meat and drinking[ 160]{.calibre4}

> our strong red wine. The ships' supply of that

> had not run out; when we had sacked the holy

> citadel of the Cicones, we all

> took gallons of it, poured in great big pitchers.

> We looked across the narrow strip of water

> at the Cyclopic island, saw their smoke,

> and heard the baaing of their sheep and goats.

> The sun went down and in the hours of darkness

> we lay and slept on shore beside the sea.

> But when the rosy hands of Dawn appeared,[ 170]{.calibre4}

> I called my men together and addressed them.

> 'My loyal friends! Stay here, the rest of you,

> while with my boat and crew I go to check

> who those men are, find out if they are wild,

> lawless aggressors, or the type to welcome

> strangers, and fear the gods.'

> > > > > > With that, I climbed

> on board and told my crew to come with me

> and then untie the cables of the ship.

> Quickly they did so, sat along the benches,

> and struck the whitening water with their oars.[ 180]{.calibre4}

> The journey was not long. Upon arrival,

> right at the edge of land, beside the sea,

> we saw a high cave overhung with laurel,

> the home of several herds of sheep and goats.

> Around that cave was built a lofty courtyard,

> of deep-set stones, with tall pines rising up,

> and leafy oaks. There lived a massive man

> who shepherded his flocks all by himself.

> He did not go to visit other people,

> but kept apart, and did not know the ways[ 190]{.calibre4}

> of custom. In his build he was a wonder,

> a giant, not like men who live on bread,

> but like a wooded peak in airy mountains,

> rising alone above the rest.

> > > > > > I told

> my loyal crew to guard the ship, while I

> would go with just twelve chosen men, my favorites.

> I took a goatskin full of dark sweet wine

> that I was given by Apollo's priest,

> Maron the son of Euanthes, who lived

> inside the shady grove on Ismarus.[ 200]{.calibre4}

> In reverence to the god, I came to help him,

> and save his wife and son. He gave me gifts:

> a silver bowl and seven pounds of gold,

> well wrought, and siphoned off some sweet strong wine,

> and filled twelve jars for me---a godlike drink.

> The slaves knew nothing of this wine; it was

> known just to him, his wife, and one house girl.

> Whenever he was drinking it, he poured

> a single shot into a cup, and added

> twenty of water, and a marvelous smell[ 210]{.calibre4}

> rose from the bowl, and all would long to taste it.

> I filled a big skin up with it, and packed

> provisions in a bag---my heart suspected

> that I might meet a man of courage, wild,

> and lacking knowledge of the normal customs.

> We soon were at the cave, but did not find

> the Cyclops; he was pasturing his flocks.

> We went inside and looked at everything.

> We saw his crates weighed down with cheese, and pens

> crammed full of lambs divided up by age:[ 220]{.calibre4}

> the newborns, middlings, and those just weaned.

> There were well-crafted bowls and pails for milking,

> all full of whey. My crew begged, 'Let us grab

> some cheese and quickly drive the kids and lambs

> out of their pens and down to our swift ships,

> and sail away across the salty water!'

> That would have been the better choice. But I

> refused. I hoped to see him, and find out

> if he would give us gifts. In fact he brought

> no joy to my companions. Then we lit[ 230]{.calibre4}

> a fire, and made a sacrifice, and ate

> some cheese, and sat to wait inside the cave

> until he brought his flocks back home. He came

> at dinnertime, and brought a load of wood

> to make a fire. He hurled it noisily

> into the cave. We were afraid, and cowered

> towards the back. He drove his ewes and nannies

> inside to milk them, but he left the rams

> and he-goats in the spacious yard outside.

> He lifted up the heavy stone and set it [ 240]{.calibre4}

> to block the entrance of the cave. It was

> a rock so huge and massive, twenty-two

> strong carts could not have dragged it from the threshold.

> He sat, and all in order milked his ewes

> and she-goats, then he set the lambs to suck

> beside each bleating mother. Then he curdled

> half of the fresh white milk, set that aside

> in wicker baskets, and the rest he stored

> in pails so he could drink it with his dinner.

> When he had carefully performed his chores,[ 250]{.calibre4}

> he lit a fire, then looked around and saw us.

> > > > > So he spoke. His voice,

> so deep and booming, and his giant size,

> I answered,

> > > > 'We are Greeks, come here from Troy.

> The winds have swept us off in all directions[ 260]{.calibre4}

> We are proud to be the men of Agamemnon,

> Unmoved he said, 'Well, foreigner, you are

> He pushed us in; wind dashed us on the rocks.

> > > > > > But he

> made no reply and showed no mercy. Leaping

> He ripped them limb by limb to make his meal,

> then ate them like a lion on the mountains,

> devouring flesh, entrails, and marrow bones,

> and leaving nothing. Watching this disaster,

> we wept and lifted up our hands in prayer

> to Zeus. We felt so helpless. When the Cyclops

> had filled his massive belly with his meal

> of human meat and unmixed milk, he lay

> stretched out among his flocks. Then thinking like

> a military man, I thought I should[ 300]{.calibre4}

> get out my sword, go up to him and thrust

> right through his torso, feeling for his liver.

> That would have doomed us all. On second thoughts,

> I realized we were too weak to move

> the mighty stone he set in the high doorway.

> So we stayed there in misery till dawn.

> Early the Dawn appeared, pink fingers blooming,

> and then he lit his fire and milked his ewes

> in turn, and set a lamb by every one.

> When he had diligently done his chores,[ 310]{.calibre4}

> he grabbed two men and made a meal of them.

> After he ate, he drove his fat flock out.

> He rolled the boulder out and back with ease,

> as one would set the lid upon a quiver.

> Then whistling merrily, the Cyclops drove

> his fat flocks to the mountain. I was left,

> scheming to take revenge on him and hurt him,

> and gain the glory, if Athena let me.

> I made my plan. Beside the pen there stood

> a great big club, green olive wood, which he[ 320]{.calibre4}

> had cut to dry, to be his walking stick.

> It was so massive that it looked to us

> like a ship's mast, a twenty-oared black freighter

> that sails across the vast sea full of cargo.

> I went and cut from it about a fathom,

> and gave it to the men, and ordered them

> to scrape it down. They made it smooth and I

> stood by and sharpened up the tip, and made it

> hard in the blazing flame. The cave was full

> of dung; I hid the club beneath a pile.[ 330]{.calibre4}

> Then I gave orders that the men cast lots

> for who would lift the stake with me and press it

> into his eye, when sweet sleep overtook him.

> The lots fell on the men I would have chosen:

> four men, and I was fifth among their number.

> At evening he drove back his woolly flocks

> into the spacious cave, both male and female,

> and left none in the yard outside---perhaps

> suspecting something, or perhaps a god

> told him to do it. He picked up and placed[ 340]{.calibre4}

> the stone to form a door, and sat to milk

> the sheep and bleating goats in turn, then put

> the little ones to suck. His chores were done;

> he grabbed two men for dinner. I approached

> and offered him a cup of ivy wood,

> filled full of wine. I said,

> > > > > > 'Here, Cyclops! You

> I brought it as a holy offering,

> so you might pity me and send me home.[ 350]{.calibre4}

> But you are in a cruel rage, beyond

> what anyone could bear. Do you expect

> He took and drank the sweet delicious wine;

> > > > > > 'Another!

> And now tell me your name, so I can give you

> My people do have wine; grape clusters grow

> But this is nectar, god food!'

> > > > > > So I gave him [ 360]{.calibre4}

> another cup of wine, and then two more.

> He drank them all, unwisely. With the wine

> gone to his head, I told him, all politeness,

> 'Cyclops, you asked my name. I will reveal it;

> of hospitality. My name is Noman.

> My family and friends all call me Noman.'

> He answered with no pity in his heart,

> 'I will eat Noman last; first I will eat

> the other men. That is my gift to you.'[ 370]{.calibre4}

> Then he collapsed, fell on his back, and lay there,

> his massive neck askew. All-conquering sleep

> wine from his throat, and chunks of human flesh.

> And then I drove the spear into the embers

> to heat it up, and told my men, 'Be brave!'

> I wanted none of them to shrink in fear.

> The fire soon seized the olive spear,

> green though it was, and terribly it glowed.

> I quickly snatched it from the fire. My crew[ 380]{.calibre4}

> stood firm: some god was breathing courage in us.

> They took the olive spear, its tip all sharp,

> and shoved it in his eye. I leaned on top

> and twisted it, as when a man drills wood

> for shipbuilding. Below, the workers spin

> the drill with straps, stretched out from either end.

> So round and round it goes, and so we whirled

> the fire-sharp weapon in his eye. His blood

> poured out around the stake, and blazing fire

> sizzled his lids and brows, and fried the roots. [ 390]{.calibre4}

> As when a blacksmith dips an axe or adze

> to temper it in ice-cold water; loudly

> it shrieks. From this, the iron takes on its power.

> So did his eyeball crackle on the spear.

> Horribly then he howled, the rocks resounded,

> and we shrank back in fear. He tugged the spear

> out of his eye, all soaked with gushing blood.

> Desperately with both hands he hurled it from him,

> and shouted to the Cyclopes who lived

> in caves high up on windy cliffs around.[ 400]{.calibre4}

> They heard and came from every side, and stood

> near to the cave, and called out, 'Polyphemus!

> What is the matter? Are you badly hurt?

> Why are you screaming through the holy night

> and keeping us awake? Is someone stealing

> your herds, or trying to kill you, by some trick

> or force?'

> > > Strong Polyphemus from inside

> replied, 'My friends! Noman is killing me

> by tricks, not force.'

> > > > > Their words flew back to him:

> 'If no one hurts you, you are all alone:[ 410]{.calibre4}

> Great Zeus has made you sick; no help for that.

> Pray to your father, mighty Lord Poseidon.'

> Then off they went, and I laughed to myself,

> at how my name, the 'no man' maneuver, tricked him.

> The Cyclops groaned and labored in his pain,

> felt with blind hands and took the door-stone out,

> and sat there at the entrance, arms outstretched,

> to catch whoever went out with the sheep.

> Maybe he thought I was a total fool.

> But I was strategizing, hatching plans,[ 420]{.calibre4}

> so that my men and I could all survive.

> I wove all kinds of wiles and cunning schemes;

> danger was near and it was life or death.

> The best idea I formed was this: there were

> those well-fed sturdy rams with good thick fleece,

> wool as dark as violets---all fine big creatures.

> So silently I tied them with the rope

> used by the giant Cyclops as a bed.

> I bound the rams in sets of three and set

> a man beneath each middle sheep, with one[ 430]{.calibre4}

> on either side, and so my men were saved.

> One ram was best of all the flock; I grabbed

> his back and curled myself up underneath

> his furry belly, clinging to his fleece;

> by force of will I kept on hanging there.

> And then we waited miserably for day.

> When early Dawn revealed her rose-red hands,

> the rams jumped up, all eager for the grass.

> The ewes were bleating in their pens, unmilked,

> their udders full to bursting. Though their master[ 440]{.calibre4}

> was weak and worn with pain, he felt the back

> of each ram as he lined them up---but missed

> the men tied up beneath their woolly bellies.

> Last of them all, the big ram went outside,

> heavy with wool and me---the clever trickster.

> Strong Polyphemus stroked his back and asked him,

> 'Sweet ram, why are you last today to leave

> the cave? You are not normally so slow.

> You are the first to eat the tender flowers,

> leaping across the meadow, first to drink,[ 450]{.calibre4}

> and first to want to go back to the sheepfold

> at evening time. But now you are the last.

> You grieve for Master's eye; that wicked man,

> helped by his nasty henchmen, got me drunk

> and blinded me. Noman will not escape!

> If only you could talk like me, and tell me

> where he is skulking in his fear of me.

> Then I would dash his brains out on the rocks,

> and make them spatter all across the cave,

> to ease the pain that no-good Noman brought.'[ 460]{.calibre4}

> With that, he nudged the ram away outside.

> We rode a short way from the cave, then I

> first freed myself and then untied my men.

> We stole his nice fat animals, and ran,

> constantly glancing all around and back

> until we reached the ship. The other men

> were glad to see us, their surviving friends,

> but wept for those who died. I ordered them

> to stop their crying, scowling hard at each.

> I made them shove the fleecy flock on board,[ 470]{.calibre4}

> and row the boat out into salty water.

> So they embarked, sat on their rowing benches,

> and struck their oar blades in the whitening sea.

> When I had gone as far as shouts can carry,

> I jeered back,

> > > > 'Hey, you, Cyclops! Idiot!

> The crew trapped in your cave did not belong

> to some poor weakling. Well, you had it coming!

> You had no shame at eating your own guests!

> So Zeus and other gods have paid you back.'

> My taunting made him angrier. He ripped[ 480]{.calibre4}

> a rock out of the hill and hurled it at us.

> It landed right in front of our dark prow,

> and almost crushed the tip of the steering oar.

> The stone sank in the water; waves surged up.

> The backflow all at once propelled the ship

> landwards; the swollen water pushed us with it.

> I grabbed a big long pole, and shoved us off.

> I told my men, 'Row fast, to save your lives!'

> and gestured with my head to make them hurry.

> They bent down to their oars and started rowing.[ 490]{.calibre4}

> We got out twice as far across the sea,

> and then I called to him again. My crew

> begged me to stop, and pleaded with me.

> > > > > > 'Please!

> Calm down! Why are you being so insistent

> and taunting this wild man? He hurled that stone

> and drove our ship right back to land. We thought

> that we were going to die. If he had heard us,

> But my tough heart was not convinced; I was[ 500]{.calibre4}

> 'Cyclops! If any mortal asks you how

[[The Winds and the Witch]{.calibre6}](#index_split_005.html_filepos3594)

> "We reached the floating island of Aeolus,

> who is well loved by all the deathless gods.

> Around it, on sheer cliffs, there runs a wall

> of solid bronze, impregnable. Twelve children

> live with him in his palace: six strong boys,

> and six girls. He arranged their marriages,

> one sister to each brother. They are always

> feasting there with their parents, at a banquet

> that never ends. By day, the savor fills

> the house; the court reverberates with sound. [ 10]{.calibre4}

> At night they sleep beside the wives they love

> on rope beds piled with blankets.

> > > > > > We arrived

> at that fine citadel. He welcomed me

> and made me stay a month, and asked for news

> of Troy, the Argive ships, and how the Greeks

> went home. I told him everything. At last

> I told him he should send me on my way.

> So he agreed to help me, and he gave me

> a bag of oxhide leather and he tied

> the gusty winds inside it. Zeus, the son[ 20]{.calibre4}

> of Cronus, made him steward of the winds,

> and he can stop or rouse them as he wishes.

> He bound the bag with shining silver wire

> to my curved ship, so no gust could escape,

> however small, and he made Zephyr blow

> so that the breath could carry home our ships

> and us. But it was not to be. Our folly

> ruined us. For nine days and nights we sailed,

> and on the tenth, our native land appeared.

> We were so near, we saw men tending fires.[ 30]{.calibre4}

> Exhausted, I let sweet sleep overcome me.

> I had been doing all the steering, hoping

> that we would get home sooner if I did.

> But while I slept my men began to mutter,

> saying the great Aeolus gave me gifts---

> silver and gold that I was taking home.

> With glances to his neighbor, each complained,

> 'It seems that everybody loves this man,

> and honors him, in every place we sail to.

> He also has that loot from sacking Troy.[ 40]{.calibre4}

> We shared the journey with him, yet we come

> back home with empty hands. And now Aeolus

> has made this friendly gift to him. So hurry,

> we should look in the bag, and see how much

> is in there---how much silver, how much gold.'

> That bad idea took hold of them; they did it.

> They opened up the bag, and all the winds

> rushed out at once. A sudden buffet seized us

> and hurled us back to sea, the wrong direction,

> far from our home. They screamed and I woke up, [ 50]{.calibre4}

> and wondered if I should jump off the ship

> and drown, or bite my lip, be stoical,

> and stay among the living. I endured it,

> covered my face, and lay on deck. A blast

> of storm wind whooshed the ships back to the island

> of great Aeolus. They began to weep.

> We disembarked and filled our jars with water,

> and hungrily the men devoured their dinner.

> When they were done, I took one slave with me

> and one crew member, back to see Aeolus.[ 60]{.calibre4}

> He was at dinner with his wife and children.

> We entered and sat down beside the doorposts.

> Startled, they asked,

> > > > > > 'Why are you here again?

> You had bad luck? What happened? Surely we

> helped you go on your way, and meant for you

> to reach your homeland, where you wished to go.'

> I answered sadly, 'Blame my men, and blame

> my stubborn urge to sleep, which ruined us.

> Dear friends, you have the power to put things right.'

> I hoped these words would soften them, but they[ 70]{.calibre4}

> were silent. Then the father yelled, 'Get out!

> You nasty creature, leave my island! Now!

> It is not right for me to help convey

> a man so deeply hated by the gods.

> You godforsaken thing, how dare you come here?

> Get out!'

> > > He roared and drove us from his palace.

> Dispirited, we sailed away. The men

> grew worn out with the agony of rowing;

> our folly had deprived us of fair winds.

> We rowed six days and nights; the seventh day[ 80]{.calibre4}

> we came to Laestrygonia---the town

> of Telepylus upon the cliffs of Lamos.

> A herdsman there, returning to his home,

> can greet another herdsman going out.

> A sleepless man could earn a double wage

> by herding cows, then pasturing white sheep---

> the paths of day and night are close together.

> We reached the famous harbor, all surrounded

> by sheer rock cliffs. On each side, strips of shore

> jut out and almost meet, a narrow mouth.[ 90]{.calibre4}

> No waves rear up in there, not even small ones.

> White calm is everywhere. So all the others

> harbored their ships inside, crammed close together.

> I was the only one who chose to moor

> my ship outside the harbor, fastening

> the cables to a rock a way away.

> I disembarked and climbed a crag to scout.

> I saw no sign of cattle or of humans,

> except some smoke that rose up from the earth.

> I picked two men, and one slave as the third,[ 100]{.calibre4}

> and sent them to find out what people lived

> and ate bread in this land. They disembarked

> and walked along a smooth path, where the wagons

> brought wood down from the mountains to the city.

> They met a girl in front of town, out fetching

> some water. She was heading for the fountain

> of Artaky, the whole town's water source.

> She was the strapping child of Antiphates,

> king of the Laestrygonians. They asked her

> about the king and people of the country.[ 110]{.calibre4}

> She promptly took them to the high-roofed palace

> of her own father. When they went inside

> they found a woman, mountain-high. They were

> appalled and shocked. The giantess at once

> summoned the king her husband from the council;

> he tried to kill my men, and grabbing one

> he ate him up. The other two escaped,

> back to the ship. The king's shout boomed through town.

> Hearing, the mighty Laestrygonians

> thronged from all sides, not humanlike, but giants.[ 120]{.calibre4}

> With boulders bigger than a man could lift

> they pelted at us from the cliffs. We heard

> the dreadful uproar of ships being broken

> and dying men. They speared them there like fish.

> A gruesome meal! While they were killing them

> inside the harbor, I drew out my sword

> and cut the ropes that moored my dark-cheeked ship,

> and yelling to my men, I told them, 'Row

> as fast as possible away from danger!'

> They rowed at double time, afraid to die.[ 130]{.calibre4}

> My ship was lucky and we reached the sea

> beyond the overhanging cliffs. The rest,

> trapped in the bay together, were destroyed.

> We sailed off sadly, happy to survive,

> but with our good friends lost. We reached Aeaea,

> home of the beautiful, dreadful goddess Circe,

> who speaks in human languages---the sister

> of Aeetes whose mind is set on ruin.

> Those two are children of the Sun who shines

> on mortals, and of Perse, child of Ocean.[ 140]{.calibre4}

> Under the guidance of some god we drifted

> silently to the harbor, and we moored there.

> For two days and two nights we lay onshore,

> exhausted and our hearts consumed with grief.

> On the third morning brought by braided Dawn,

> I took my spear and sharp sword, and I ran

> up from the ship to higher ground, to look

> for signs of humans, listening for voices.

> I climbed up to a crag, and I saw smoke

> rising from Circe's palace, from the earth[ 150]{.calibre4}

> up through the woods and thickets. I considered

> if I should go down and investigate,

> since I had seen the smoke. But I decided

> to go back down first, to the beach and ship

> and feed my men, and then set out to scout.

> When I had almost reached my ship, some god

> took pity on me in my loneliness,

> and sent a mighty stag with great tall antlers

> to cross my path. He ran down from the forest

> to drink out of the river; it was hot.[ 160]{.calibre4}

> I struck him in the middle of his back;

> my bronze spear pierced him. With a moan, he fell

> onto the dust; his spirit flew away.

> I stepped on him and tugged my bronze spear out,

> and left it on the ground, while I plucked twigs

> and twines, and wove a rope, a fathom's length,

> well knotted all the way along, and bound

> the hooves of that huge animal. I went

> down to my dark ship with him on my back.

> I used my spear to lean on, since the stag[ 170]{.calibre4}

> was too big to be lugged across one shoulder.

> I dumped him down before the ship and made

> a comforting pep talk to cheer my men.

> 'My friends! We will not yet go down to Hades,

> sad though we are, before our fated day.

> Come on, since we have food and drink on board,

> let us not starve ourselves; now time to eat!'

> They quickly heeded my commands, and took

> their cloaks down from their faces, and they marveled

> to see the big stag lying on the beach.[ 180]{.calibre4}

> It was enormous. When they finished staring,

> they washed their hands and cooked a splendid meal.

> So all that day till sunset we sat eating

> the meat aplenty and the strong sweet wine.

> When darkness fell, we went to sleep beside

> the seashore. Then the roses of Dawn's fingers

> appeared again; I called my men and told them,

> 'Listen to me, my friends, despite your grief.

> We do not know where darkness lives, nor dawn,

> nor where the sun that shines upon the world[ 190]{.calibre4}

> goes underneath the earth, nor where it rises.

> We need a way to fix our current plight,

> but I do not know how. I climbed the rocks

> to higher ground to look around. This is

> an island, wreathed about by boundless sea.

> The land lies low. I saw smoke in the middle,

> rising up through the forest and thick bush.'

> At that, their hearts sank, since they all remembered

> what happened with the Laestrygonians,

> their King Antiphates, and how the mighty[ 200]{.calibre4}

> Cyclops devoured the men. They wept and wailed,

> and shed great floods of tears. But all that grieving

> could do no good. I made them wear their armor,

> and split them in two groups. I led one,

> and made godlike Eurylochus lead the other.

> We shook the lots in a helmet made of bronze;

> Eurylochus' lot jumped out. So he

> went with his band of twenty-two, all weeping.

> Those left behind with me were crying too.

> Inside the glade they found the house of Circe [ 210]{.calibre4}

> built out of polished stones, on high foundations.

> Round it were mountain wolves and lions, which

> she tamed with drugs. They did not rush on them,

> but gathered around them in a friendly way,

> their long tails wagging, as dogs nuzzle round

> their master when he comes back home from dinner

> with treats for them. Just so, those sharp-clawed wolves

> and lions, mighty beasts, came snuggling up.

> The men were terrified. They stood outside

> and heard some lovely singing. It was Circe,[ 220]{.calibre4}

> the goddess. She was weaving as she sang,

> an intricate, enchanting piece of work,

> the kind a goddess fashions. Then Polites,

> my most devoted and most loyal man,

> a leader to his peers, said,

> > > > > > 'Friends, inside

> someone is weaving on that massive loom,

> and singing so the floor resounds. Perhaps

> a woman, or a goddess. Let us call her.'

> They shouted out to her. She came at once,

> opened the shining doors, and asked them in.[ 230]{.calibre4}

> So thinking nothing of it, in they went.

> Eurylochus alone remained outside,

> suspecting trickery. She led them in,

> sat them on chairs, and blended them a potion

> of barley, cheese, and golden honey, mixed

> with Pramnian wine. She added potent drugs

> to make them totally forget their home.

> They took and drank the mixture. Then she struck them,

> using her magic wand, and penned them in

> the pigsty. They were turned to pigs in body[ 240]{.calibre4}

> and voice and hair; their minds remained the same.

> They squealed at their imprisonment, and Circe

> threw them some mast and cornel cherries---food

> that pigs like rooting for in muddy ground.

> Eurylochus ran back to our black ship,

> to tell us of the terrible disaster

> that happened to his friends. He tried to speak,

> but could not, overwhelmed by grief. His eyes

> were full of tears, his heart was pierced with sorrow.

> Astonished, we all questioned him. At last[ 250]{.calibre4}

> he spoke about what happened to the others.

> 'Odysseus, we went off through the woods,

> as you commanded. In the glade we found

> a beautiful tall house of polished stone.

> We heard a voice: a woman or a goddess

> was singing as she worked her loom. My friends

> called out to her. She opened up the doors,

> inviting them inside. Suspecting nothing,

> they followed her. But I stayed there outside,

> fearing some trick. Then all at once, they vanished.[ 260]{.calibre4}

> I sat there for a while to watch and wait,

> but none of them came back.'

> > > > > > At this, I strapped

> my silver-studded sword across my back,

> took up my bow, and told him, 'Take me there.'

> He grasped my knees and begged me tearfully,

> 'No no, my lord! Please do not make me go!

> Let me stay here! You cannot bring them back,

> and you will not return here if you try.

> Hurry, we must escape with these men here!

> We have a chance to save our lives!'

> > > > > > I said, [ 270]{.calibre4}

> 'You can stay here beside the ship and eat

> and drink. But I will go. I must do this.'

> I left the ship and shore, and walked on up,

> crossing the sacred glades, and I had almost

> reached the great house of the enchantress Circe,

> when I met Hermes, carrying his wand

> of gold. He seemed an adolescent boy,

> the cutest age, when beards first start to grow.

> He took my hand and said,

> > > > > > 'Why have you come

> If you try that, you will not get back home.

> You will stay here with them. But I can help you.

> Here, take this antidote to keep you safe

> She will make you a potion mixed with poison.

> Its magic will not work on you because[ 290]{.calibre4}

> you have the herb I gave you. When she strikes you

> with her long wand, then draw your sharpened sword

> and rush at her as if you mean to kill her.

> She will be frightened of you, and will tell you

> she is a goddess. If you sleep with her,

> you will set free your friends and save yourself.

> Tell her to swear an oath by all the gods

> that she will not plot further harm for you---

> or while you have your clothes off, she may hurt you,[ 300]{.calibre4}

> > > > > The bright mercurial god

> I sipped it, but the magic did not work.

> She struck me with her wand and said,

> > > > > > 'Now go!

> Out to the sty, and lie there with your men!'[ 320]{.calibre4}

> But I drew my sharp sword from by my thigh

> She screamed and ducked beneath the sword, and grasped

> > > > > > 'Who are you?

> Where is your city? And who are your parents?

> I am amazed that you could drink my potion

> and yet not be bewitched. No other man

> has drunk it and withstood the magic charm.

> But you are different. Your mind is not

> the man who can adapt to anything.

> Bright flashing Hermes of the golden wand

> has often told me that you would sail here

> from Troy in your swift ship. Now sheathe your sword

> and come to bed with me. Through making love

> I answered, 'Circe! How can you command me

> to treat you gently, when you turned my men

> to pigs, and you are planning to play tricks

> in telling me to come to bed with you,[ 340]{.calibre4}

> so you can take my courage and my manhood

> > > > > > When I said that,

> at once she made the oath as I had asked.

> She vowed and formed the oath, and then at last

> I went up to the dazzling bed of Circe.

> Meanwhile, four slaves, her house girls, were at work

> around the palace. They were nymphs, the daughters[ 350]{.calibre4}

> of fountains and of groves and holy rivers

> that flow into the sea. One set fine cloths

> of purple on the chairs, with stones beneath them.

> Beside each chair, another pulled up tables

> of silver and set golden baskets on them.

> The third mixed up inside a silver bowl

> sweet, cheering wine, and poured it in gold cups.

> The fourth brought water, and she lit a fire

> beneath a mighty tripod, till it boiled.

> It started bubbling in the copper cauldron;[ 360]{.calibre4}

> she took me to the bathtub, and began

> to wash my head and shoulders, using water

> mixed to the perfect temperature, to take

> my deep soul-crushing weariness away.

> After the bath, she oiled my skin and dressed me

> in fine wool cloak and tunic, and she led me

> to a silver-studded well-carved chair, and set

> a footstool underneath. Another slave

> brought water for my hands, in a gold pitcher,

> and poured it over them, to a silver bowl.[ 370]{.calibre4}

> She set a polished table near. The cook

> brought bread and laid a generous feast, and Circe

> told me to eat. But my heart was unwilling.

> I sat there with my mind on other things;

> I had forebodings. Circe noticed me

> sitting, not touching food, and weighed by grief.

> She stood near me and asked, 'Odysseus!

> why are you sitting there so silently,

> like someone mute, eating your heart, not touching

> the banquet or the wine? You need not fear.[ 380]{.calibre4}

> Remember, I already swore an oath.'

> But I said, 'Circe, no! What decent man

> could bear to taste his food or sip his wine

> before he saw his men with his own eyes,

> and set them free? If you are so insistent

> on telling me to eat and drink, then free them,

> so I may see with my own eyes my crew

> of loyal men.'

> > > > So Circe left the hall

> holding her wand, and opened up the pigsty

> and drove them out, still looking like fat boars,[ 390]{.calibre4}

> large and full grown. They stood in front of her.

> Majestic Lady Circe walked among them,

> anointing each with some new drug. The potion

> had made thick hog-hairs sprout out on their bodies.

> Those bristles all flew off and they were men,

> but younger than before, and much more handsome,

> and taller. Then they recognized me. Each

> embraced me tightly in his arms, and started

> sobbing in desperation. So the house

> rang loud with noise, and even she herself[ 400]{.calibre4}

> pitied them. She came near to me and said,

> 'Odysseus, you always find solutions.

> Go now to your swift ship beside the sea.

> First drag the ship to land, and bring your stores

> and all your gear inside the caves. Then come

> back with your loyal men.'

> > > > > > My heart agreed;

> I went down to my swift ship on the shore.

> I found my loyal men beside the ship,

> weeping and shedding floods of tears. As when

> a herd of cows is coming back from pasture[ 410]{.calibre4}

> into the yard; and all the little heifers

> jump from their pens to skip and run towards

> their mothers, and they cluster round them, mooing;

> just so my men, as soon as they saw me,

> began to weep, and in their minds it seemed

> as if they had arrived in their own home,

> the land of rugged Ithaca, where they

> were born and raised. Still sobbing, they cried out,

> 'Oh, Master! We are glad to see you back!

> It is as if we had come home ourselves,[ 420]{.calibre4}

> to Ithaca, our fatherland. But tell us

> about how all our other friends were killed.'

> I reassured them, saying, 'First we must

> drag up the ship to land, and put the stores

> and all our gear inside the caves; then hurry,

> all of you, come with me, and see your friends

> inside the goddess Circe's holy house,

> eating and drinking; they have food enough

> > > > They believed my story,

> with the exception of Eurylochus,[ 430]{.calibre4}

> who warned them,

> > > > > 'Fools! Why would you go up there?

> Why would you choose to take on so much danger,

> to enter Circe's house, where she will turn us

> to pigs or wolves or lions, all of us,

> forced to protect her mighty house for her?

> Remember what the Cyclops did? Our friends

> went to his home with this rash lord of ours.

> Because of his bad choices, they all died.'

> At that, I thought of drawing my long sword

> saying to me, 'No, king, please let him go!

> Let him stay here and guard the ship, and we

> So they went up, away from ship and shore.

> Eurylochus did not stay there; he came,

> fearing my angry scolding.

> > > > > > Meanwhile Circe

> had freed the other men, and in her house

> she gently bathed them, rubbing them with oil.[ 450]{.calibre4}

> She had them dressed in woolen cloaks and tunics.

> We found them feasting in the hall. The men,

> seeing each other face-to-face again,

> began to weep; their sobbing filled the hall.

> The goddess stood beside me and said,

> > > > > > 'King,

> clever Odysseus, Laertes' son,

> now stop encouraging this lamentation.

> I know you and your men have suffered greatly,

> out on the fish-filled sea, and on dry land

> from hostile men. But it is time to eat[ 460]{.calibre4}

> and drink some wine. You must get back the drive

> you had when you set out from Ithaca.

> You are worn down and brokenhearted, always

> dwelling on pain and wandering. You never

> feel joy at heart. You have endured too much.'

> We did as she had said. Then every day

> for a whole year we feasted there on meat

> and sweet strong wine. But when the year was over,

> when months had waned and seasons turned, and each

> long day had passed its course, my loyal men[ 470]{.calibre4}

> called me and said,

> > > > > 'Be guided by the gods.

> Now it is time to think of our own country,

> if you are fated to survive and reach

> your high-roofed house and your forefathers' land.'

> My warrior soul agreed. So all day long

> till sunset we kept sitting at the feast

> set, and the darkness came, they went to bed

> all through the shadowy palace. I went up

> to Circe's splendid bed, and touched her knees[ 480]{.calibre4}

> in supplication, and the goddess listened.

> 'Circe,' I said, 'Fulfill the vow you made

> My men are also desperate to leave.

> Whenever you are absent, they exhaust me

> > > > > > And she answered,

> 'Laertes' son, great King Odysseus,

> But first you must complete another journey.[ 490]{.calibre4}

> Go to the house of Hades and the dreadful

> Persephone, and ask the Theban prophet,

> the blind Tiresias, for his advice.

> Persephone has given him alone

> full understanding, even now in death.

> The other spirits flit around as shadows.'

> That broke my heart, and sitting on the bed

> I wept, and lost all will to live and see

> the shining sun. When I was done with sobbing

> and rolling round in grief, I said to her,[ 500]{.calibre4}

> 'But Circe, who can guide us on this journey?

> No one before has ever sailed to Hades

> > > And right away the goddess answered,

> "We reached the sea and first of all we launched

> set up the mast and sails, and brought the sheep

> on board with us. We were still grieving, weeping,

> in floods of tears. But beautiful, dread Circe,

> the goddess who can speak in human tongues,

> sent us a wind to fill our sails, fair wind

> befriending us behind the dark blue prow.

> We made our tackle shipshape, then sat down.

> The wind and pilot guided straight our course.[ 10]{.calibre4}

> The sun set. It was dark in all directions.

> We reached the limits of deep-flowing Ocean,

> where the Cimmerians live and have their city.

> Their land is covered up in mist and cloud;

> the shining Sun God never looks on them

> with his bright beams---not when he rises up

> into the starry sky, nor when he turns

> back from the heavens to earth. Destructive night

> blankets the world for all poor mortals there.

> We beached our ship, drove out the sheep, and went[ 20]{.calibre4}

> to seek the stream of Ocean where the goddess

> had told us we must go. Eurylochus

> and Perimedes made the sacrifice.

> I drew my sword and dug a hole, a fathom

> widthways and lengthways, and I poured libations

> for all the dead: first honey-mix, sweet wine,

> and lastly, water. On the top, I sprinkled

> barley, and made a solemn vow that if

> I reached my homeland, I would sacrifice

> my best young heifer, still uncalved, and pile[ 30]{.calibre4}

> the altar high with offerings for the dead.

> I promised for Tiresias as well

> a pure black sheep, the best in all my flock.

> So with these vows, I called upon the dead.

> I took the sheep and slit their throats above

> the pit. Black blood flowed out. The spirits came

> up out of Erebus and gathered round.

> Teenagers, girls and boys, the old who suffered

> for many years, and fresh young brides whom labor

> destroyed in youth; and many men cut down[ 40]{.calibre4}

> in battle by bronze spears, still dressed in armor

> stained with their blood. From every side they crowded

> around the pit, with eerie cries. Pale fear

> took hold of me. I roused my men and told them

> to flay the sheep that I had killed, and burn them,

> and pray to Hades and Persephone.

> I drew my sword and sat on guard, preventing

> the spirits of the dead from coming near

> the blood, till I had met Tiresias.

> First came the spirit of my man Elpenor,[ 50]{.calibre4}

> who had not yet been buried in the earth.

> We left his body in the house of Circe

> without a funeral or burial;

> we were too occupied with other things.

> On sight of him, I wept in pity, saying,

> 'Elpenor, how did you come here, in darkness?

> You came on foot more quickly than I sailed.'

> He groaned in answer, 'Lord Odysseus,

> you master every circumstance. But I

> had bad luck from some god, and too much wine[ 60]{.calibre4}

> befuddled me. In Circe's house I lay

> upstairs, and I forgot to use the ladder

> to climb down from the roof. I fell headfirst;

> my neck was broken from my spine. My spirit

> came down to Hades. By the men you left,

> the absent ones! And by your wife! And father,

> who brought you up from babyhood! And by

> your son, Telemachus, whom you abandoned

> alone at home, I beg you! When you sail

> from Hades and you dock your ship again[ 70]{.calibre4}

> at Aeaea, please my lord, remember me.

> Do not go on and leave me there unburied,

> abandoned, without tears or lamentation---

> or you will make the gods enraged at you.

> Burn me with all my arms, and heap a mound

> beside the gray salt sea, so in the future

> people will know of me and my misfortune.

> And fix into the tomb the oar I used

> 'Poor man!' I answered, 'I will do all this.'[ 80]{.calibre4}

> We sat there talking sadly---I on one side

> I said, 'Tiresias, I hope the gods

> With that, Tiresias, the prophet spirit,[ 150]{.calibre4}

> Despite his rage, we might have spoken longer

> Two vultures sit on either side of him,

> I saw a phantom of great Heracles.[ 600]{.calibre4}

> The man himself is with the deathless gods,

> happy and feasting, with fine-ankled Hebe,

> the child of mighty Zeus and golden Hera.

> Around his ghost, the dead souls shrieked like birds,

> We beached the ship upon the sandy shore,

> and dragged a pillar onto it, and fixed

> his oar on top---each ritual step in turn.

> Circe, the well-groomed goddess, was aware

> Eat now, and stay here drinking wine all day.

> At dawn, sail on. I will explain your route

> a means to hurt you, on the land or sea.'

> I am a stubborn man, but I agreed,

> so there we sat and feasted on the meat

> and strong sweet wine until the sun went down.[ 30]{.calibre4}

> When darkness fell, the men slept by the ship.

> Then Circe took my hand, and led me off

> apart from them, and questioned me in detail.

> I told her everything. The lady Circe

> replied at last,

> > > > 'That quest is over now.

> So listen, I will give you good instructions;

> another god will make sure you remember.

> First you will reach the Sirens, who bewitch

> all passersby. If anyone goes near them

> in ignorance, and listens to their voices,[ 40]{.calibre4}

> that man will never travel to his home,

> and never make his wife and children happy

> to have him back with them again. The Sirens

> who sit there in their meadow will seduce him

> with piercing songs. Around about them lie

> great heaps of men, flesh rotting from their bones,

> their skin all shriveled up. Use wax to plug

> your sailors' ears as you row past, so they

> are deaf to them. But if you wish to hear them,

> your men must fasten you to your ship's mast[ 50]{.calibre4}

> by hand and foot, straight upright, with tight ropes.

> So bound, you can enjoy the Sirens' song.

> But if you beg your men to set you free,

> they have to tie you down with firmer knots.

> I will not give you definite instructions

> about which route to take when you have sailed

> beyond the Sirens. Let your heart decide.

> There are two choices, and the first goes through

> vast overhanging rocks, which Amphitrite

> batters aggressively with mighty waves. [ 60]{.calibre4}

> The blessed gods call these the Wandering Rocks.

> No birds can fly through safe, not even doves,

> who bring ambrosia to Zeus. One dove

> is always lost in that sheer gulf of stone

> and Zeus must send another to restore

> the number of the flock. No human ship

> has ever passed there. When one tries to enter,

> the waves and raging gusts of fire engulf

> ship timbers and the bodies of the men.

> Only the famous [Argo]{.italic} sailed through there[ 70]{.calibre4}

> returning from the visit with Aeetes.

> The current hurled the ship towards the rocks,

> but Hera, who loved Jason, led them safe.

> Taking the second way, you meet two rocks:

> one reaches up to heaven with its peak,

> surrounded by blue fog that never clears.

> No light comes through there, even in the summer.

> No man could climb it or set foot upon it,

> even if he had twenty hands and feet.

> The rock is sheer, as if it had been polished.[ 80]{.calibre4}

> Right in the middle lies a murky cave

> that faces west, towards dark Erebus.

> Steer your ship past it, great Odysseus.

> The hollow cave is so high up, no man

> could shoot it with an arrow. There lives Scylla,

> howling and barking horribly; her voice

> is puppylike, but she is dangerous;

> even a god would be afraid of her.

> She has twelve dangling legs and six long necks

> with a gruesome head on each, and in each face[ 90]{.calibre4}

> three rows of crowded teeth, pregnant with death.

> Her belly slumps inside the hollow cave;

> she keeps her heads above the yawning chasm

> and scopes around the rock, and hunts for fish.

> She catches dolphins, seals, and sometimes even

> enormous whales---Queen Amphitrite, ruler

> of roaring waters, nurtures many creatures.

> No sailors ever pass that way unharmed.

> She snatches one man with each mouth from off

> each dark-prowed ship. The other rock is near,[ 100]{.calibre4}

> enough to shoot an arrow right across.

> This second rock is lower down, and on it

> there grows a fig tree with thick leaves. Beneath,

> divine Charybdis sucks black water down.

> Three times a day she spurts it up; three times

> she glugs it down. Avoid that place when she

> is swallowing the water. No one could

> save you from death then, even great Poseidon.

> Row fast, and steer your ship alongside Scylla,

> since it is better if you lose six men[ 110]{.calibre4}

> than all of them.'

> > > > > I answered, 'Goddess, please,

> tell me the truth: is there no other way?

> Or can I somehow circumvent Charybdis

> and stop that Scylla when she tries to kill

> my men?'

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> > > The goddess answered, 'No, you fool!

> Your mind is still obsessed with deeds of war.

> But now you must surrender to the gods.

> She is not mortal. She is deathless evil,

> terrible, wild and cruel. You cannot fight her.

> The best solution and the only way[ 120]{.calibre4}

> is flight. I am afraid if you take time

> to arm beside the rock, she will attack

> again with all six heads and take six more.

> So row away with all your might, and call

> on Scylla's mother, Cratais, Great Force,

> who bore her as a blight on humankind.

> Go fast, before the goddess strikes again.

> Then you will reach the island called Thrinacia,

> where Helius keeps sheep and many cattle:

> fifty per herd, with seven herds in all.[ 130]{.calibre4}

> They never reproduce or die, and those

> who tend them are the smooth-haired goddesses,

> Phaethousa and Lampetia, the shining

> daughters of Helius by bright Neaira.

> She brought them up, then sent them off to live

> there in remote Thrinacia, to guard

> their father's sheep and cattle. If you can

> remember home and leave the cows unharmed,

> you will at last arrive in Ithaca.

> But if you damage them, I must foretell[ 140]{.calibre4}

> disaster for your ship and for your crew.

> Even if you survive, you will return

> late and humiliated, having caused

> the death of all your men.'

> > > > > > The golden throne

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> I went back to my ship and roused the men

> to get on board and loose the sternward cables.

> Embarking, they sat down, each in his place,

> Behind our dark-prowed ship, the dreadful goddess

> Circe sent friendly wind to fill the sails.

> We worked efficiently to organize

> the rigging, and the breeze and pilot steered.

> Then with an anxious heart I told the crew,

> 'My friends, the revelations Circe shared

> with me should not be kept a secret, known

> to me alone. I will share them with you,

> and we can die in knowledge of the truth,

> or else escape. She said we must avoid[ 160]{.calibre4}

> > > > > > So I told them

> and suddenly, the wind died down. Calm came.[ 170]{.calibre4}

> Some spirit lulled the waves to sleep. The men

> got up, pulled down the sails, and stowed them in

> the hollow hold. They sat at oar and made

> the water whiten, struck by polished wood.

> I gripped a wheel of wax between my hands

> and cut it small. Firm kneading and the sunlight

> warmed it, and then I rubbed it in the ears

> of each man in his turn. They bound my hands

> and feet, straight upright at the mast. They sat

> and hit the sea with oars. We traveled fast,[ 180]{.calibre4}

> and when we were in earshot of the Sirens,

> they knew our ship was near, and started singing.

> 'Odysseus! Come here! You are well-known

> from many stories! Glory of the Greeks!

> Now stop your ship and listen to our voices.

> All those who pass this way hear honeyed song,

> poured from our mouths. The music brings them joy,

> and they go on their way with greater knowledge,

> since we know everything the Greeks and Trojans

> suffered in Troy, by gods' will; and we know[ 190]{.calibre4}

> whatever happens anywhere on earth.'

> Their song was so melodious, I longed

> to listen more. I told my men to free me.

> I scowled at them, but they kept rowing on.

> Eurylochus and Perimedes stood

> and tied me even tighter, with more knots.

> But when we were well past them and I could

> no longer hear the singing of the Sirens,

> I nodded to my men, and they removed

> the wax that I had used to plug their ears,[ 200]{.calibre4}

> and untied me. When we had left that island,

> I saw a mighty wave and smoke, and heard

> a roar. The men were terrified; their hands

> let fall the oars---they splashed down in the water.

> The ship stayed still, since no one now was pulling

> the slender blades. I strode along the deck

> pausing to cheer each man, then gave a speech

> to rally all of them.

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> > > > > 'Dear friends! We are

> worse than the time the Cyclops captured us,[ 210]{.calibre4}

> and forced us to remain inside his cave.

> We got away that time, thanks to my skill

> and brains and strategy. Remember that.

> Come on then, all of you, and trust my words.

> Sit on your benches, strike the swelling deep

> with oars, since Zeus may grant us a way out

> from this disaster also. Pilot, listen:

> these are your orders. As you hold the rudder,

> direct the ship away from that dark smoke

> and rising wave, and head towards the rock;[ 220]{.calibre4}

> if the ship veers the other way, you will

> endanger us.'

> > > > They promptly followed orders.

> I did not mention Scylla, since she meant

> inevitable death, and if they knew,

> the men would drop the oars and go and huddle

> down in the hold in fear. Then I ignored

> Circe's advice that I should not bear arms;

> it was too hard for me. I dressed myself

> in glorious armor; in my hands I took

> two long spears, and I climbed up on the forecastle.[ 230]{.calibre4}

> I thought that rocky Scylla would appear

> from that direction, to destroy my men.

> So we rowed through the narrow strait in tears.

> On one side, Scylla; on the other, shining

> Charybdis with a dreadful gurgling noise

> sucked down the water. When she spewed it out,

> she seethed, all churning like a boiling cauldron

> on a huge fire. The froth flew high, to spatter

> the topmost rocks on either side. But when

> she swallowed back the sea, she seemed all stirred[ 240]{.calibre4}

> from inside, and the rock around was roaring

> dreadfully, and the dark-blue sand below

> was visible. The men were seized by fear.

> But while our frightened gaze was on Charybdis,

> Scylla snatched six men from the ship---my strongest,

> best fighters. Looking back from down below,

> I saw their feet and hands up high, as they

> were carried off. In agony they cried

> to me and called my name---their final words.

> As when a fisherman out on a cliff[ 250]{.calibre4}

> casts his long rod and line set round with oxhorn

> to trick the little fishes with his bait;

> when one is caught, he flings it gasping back

> onto the shore---so those men gasped as Scylla

> lifted them up high to her rocky cave

> and at the entrance ate them up---still screaming,

> still reaching out to me in their death throes.

> That was the most heartrending sight I saw

> in all the time I suffered on the sea.

> Free from the rocks of Scylla and Charybdis[ 260]{.calibre4}

> we quickly reached the island of the god,

> Hyperion's son Helius, the Sun God.

> There were his cattle, with their fine broad faces,

> and many flocks of well-fed sheep. While still

> out on the sea in my black ship, I heard

> the lowing of the cattle in their pens,

> and bleating of the sheep. I kept in mind

> the words of blind Tiresias the prophet

> and Circe. Both had given strict instructions

> that we avoid the island of the Sun,[ 270]{.calibre4}

> > > They were quite downcast by this.

> Eurylochus said angrily to me,

> 'You are unfair to us, Odysseus. [ 280]{.calibre4}

> You may be strong; you never seem to tire;

> have had no rest or sleep; we are exhausted.

> And you refuse to let us disembark

> You order us to drift around all night

> in our swift ship across the misty sea.

> At night, fierce storms rise up and wreck men's ships,

> and how can anyone escape disaster

> if sudden gusts of wind from north or west[ 290]{.calibre4}

> > > > > > That was his speech.

> The other men agreed, and then I saw

> a spirit must be plotting our destruction.

> My words flew out.

> > > > > 'Eurylochus! You force me

> to yield, since I am one and you are many.

> But all of you, swear me a mighty oath:[ 300]{.calibre4}

> if we find any herd of cows, or flock

> of sheep, do not be fool enough to kill

> a single animal. Stay clear, and eat

> They swore as I commanded. When they finished

> The men got out and skillfully cooked dinner.

> When they were satisfied with food and drink,

> they wept, remembering their dear companions,[ 310]{.calibre4}

> whom Scylla captured from the ship and ate.

> Sweet sleep came down upon them as they cried.

> When night was over, when the stars were gone,

> I gave a speech to my assembled men.

> 'My friends, we have supplies on board. Let us[ 320]{.calibre4}

> not touch the cattle, or we will regret it.

> Those cows and fat sheep are the property

> But when our ship's supplies ran out, the men[ 330]{.calibre4}

> were forced to hunt; they used their hooks to catch

> since hunger gnawed their bellies. I strode off

> to pray, in case some god would show me how

> > > > > > All the others

> The king's words pleased them all. They went back home

> Then all the men went back with him to eat.

> The holy king killed sacrificial meat---

> a cow to Zeus of dark clouds, son of Cronus,

> who rules the world. They burned the thighs and feasted

> in happiness. The well-respected singer

> Demodocus made music in their midst.

> But all the while Odysseus kept turning

> a man is desperate for dinnertime

> after he spends the whole day with his oxen

> > > > > > So the steward mixed

> Arete sent some slave girls too. One brought

> carried the well-carved chest; the third brought bread[ 70]{.calibre4}

> and red wine. When they reached the ship, the guides

> the cable from the mooring stone. They pulled,

> leaning back hard; the oar blades splashed the water.

> A sound sweet sleep fell on his eyes, like death;[ 80]{.calibre4}

> he did not stir. As four fine stallions

> rush at the whip and race their chariot

> across the track, heads high, an easy canter---

> so was the ship's prow raised. The seething waves

> so fast, and cleaved the waves. She bore a man

> whose mind was like the gods', who had endured

> many heartbreaking losses, and the pain[ 90]{.calibre4}

> of war and shipwreck. Now he slept in peace,

> and he remembered nothing of his pain.

> But when the brightest star that carries news

> about the coming Dawn rose up the sky,

> the seaborne ship neared land. There is a harbor

> of Phorcys, ancient sea god, in the district

> of Ithaca. On either side of it

> there are sheer cliffs that jut across the bay;

> they shelter it and keep big waves outside

> when storm winds blow. The ships remain in harbor[ 100]{.calibre4}

> without a tether, once they cross its bounds.

> At the bay's head there grows a long-leafed olive,

> and near it is a beautiful dark cave,

> a holy place of sea-nymphs---Nereids.

> Inside are bowls and amphorae of stone,

> and buzzing bees bring honey. There are looms,

> also of stone; the Nymphs weave purple cloth,

> sea-purple---it is marvelous to see.

> Water is always flowing through. There are

> two entrances. The north one is for humans;[ 110]{.calibre4}

> that way---it is the path of the immortals.

> They rowed inside the bay; they knew the place

> We saw it all!" They could not understand it.

> Alcinous addressed the crowd and spoke.[ 170]{.calibre4}

> "So it is true! My father long ago

> said that Poseidon hates us for our habit

> we got away with it, but he foretold

> Proudly I say, I come from spacious Crete,

> the son of wealthy Castor Hylacides,[ 200]{.calibre4}

> whose sons by his main wife were numerous,

> raised in his house. My mother was a slave,

> bought as a concubine, and yet my father

> respected me like all his other sons.

> The Cretan people held him in high honor

> as if he were a god, since he was rich

> selfishly seized his property, and gave

> only a tiny part to me, with barely[ 210]{.calibre4}

> a place to live. But I was not a weakling,

> or cowardly in fighting. My great skill

> and talent helped me win a wife who had

> a decent dowry---all lost now. But you

> can see in stubble how the grain once grew,

> though I am crushed by grief. I have the gift

> of courage from Athena and from Ares.

> Whenever I chose warriors to ambush

> our enemies, I never thought of death.

> I leapt out far in front, and ran to catch them[ 220]{.calibre4}

> and spear them. That was how I was in war.

> I did not like farmwork or housekeeping,

> or raising children. I liked sailing better,

> and war with spears and arrows, deadly weapons.

> Others may shudder at such things, but gods

> made my heart love them. People's preferences

> are different. Before the Greeks went off

> to march on Troy, I led my troops and fleet

> on nine forays, with great success. I had

> my pick of all the spoils, and got much more[ 230]{.calibre4}

> when we shared out the winnings. Soon my house

> grew rich; I was a fine, important man

> among the Cretans. But far-seeing Zeus

> arranged that expedition of disaster,

> which made so many men collapse and fall.

> The people wanted me to sail to Troy

> with Idomeneus. We had no choice;

> their will was strong, constraining us. We Greeks

> fought for nine years, and in the tenth we sacked

> the town of Priam, and sailed home. Some god[ 240]{.calibre4}

> scattered the Greeks, and I was cursed by Zeus.

> I stayed for just one month at home, enjoying

> my children and my wife and my possessions.

> Some impulse made me want to sail to Egypt,

> with nine ships and a godlike crew. I rushed

> to get the fleet prepared and gather up

> the men. I paid for many animals,

> to kill as sacrifices for the gods

> and for the men to cook and eat. We feasted

> six days, then on the seventh we embarked [ 250]{.calibre4}

> and sailed from Crete. A fair north wind was blowing

> so we could drift on easily, like floating

> downstream. No one got sick, and all our ships

> came through undamaged. We sat tight, and let

> the wind and pilot guide us over seas.

> In five days we had reached the river valley

> of Egypt; my fleet docked inside the Nile.

> I told the loyal men to wait and guard

> the ships while I sent scouts to check around

> from points of higher ground. But they indulged[ 260]{.calibre4}

> their own aggressive impulses, and started

> willfully doing damage to the fields

> of Egypt and enslaved the little children

> and women, and they killed the men. The news

> soon reached the city; people heard the screaming,

> and right away at dawn, they all arrived.

> The plain was filled with warriors on foot,

> and chariots and gleaming bronze, and Zeus,

> the Lord of Lightning, caused my men to panic.

> They dared not keep on fighting; danger lurked[ 270]{.calibre4}

> on every side. Then many of my men

> Zeus put another plan into my mind.

> I took my helmet off my head and dropped

> he kept me safe, and took me home with him,[ 280]{.calibre4}

> riding his chariot. My eyes were wet.

> Many Egyptians were enraged with me,

> and tried to kill me with their spears; the king

> protected me---he feared the wrath of Zeus,

> the god of strangers, who hates wickedness.

> I stayed there seven years and gained great wealth;

> all the Egyptian people gave me gifts.

> But in the eighth, an avaricious man

> came from Phoenicia. He was good at lying,

> skilled and well practiced at exploiting people. [ 290]{.calibre4}

> He tricked me into going off with him

> had rolled around again, he made me sail

> over the seas to Libya, pretending

> His true plan was to sell me for a profit.

> I had suspicions, but I climbed on board.

> The ship sailed out with fair north wind behind her

> planned to destroy the crew. On leaving Crete,

> no other land was visible, but only

> of lightning at the ship. The impact whirled

> the ship right round and filled her up with sulfur.

> The men fell overboard and all were swept

> towards Thesprotia. There the king, named Pheidon,

> helped me without expecting recompense

> because his son had found me all worn out,

> chilled by the morning air. He took my hand,

> raised me and led me to his father's house,[ 320]{.calibre4}

> and dressed me. That was where I heard about

> Odysseus---the king said he had been

> Odysseus, the king said, had gone off

> to Dodona, to ask the holy oak

> what Zeus intended. He had been too long[ 330]{.calibre4}

> away from fertile Ithaca. He wondered

> how best to get back home---in some disguise

> or openly. The king then swore to me,

> sailing towards grain-rich Dulichium.

> The king told them to treat me well and take me

> to King Acastus. But their hearts preferred[ 340]{.calibre4}

> to bring me once again to misery.

> After the ship was out upon the sea,

> they plotted to enslave me. They stripped off

> my cloak and tunic, and tossed me these rags

> in which you see me now. And when night fell

> they came to Ithaca's bright fields, and tied me

> tightly with rope and left me on the ship,

> and quickly went ashore to get some dinner.

> The gods themselves unloosed my bonds; they slipped

> easily off. I pulled my ragged clothes[ 350]{.calibre4}

> over my head, slid down the smooth ship's plank

> and plunged chest-forward in the sea. I swam

> fast with both arms, and quickly got away.

> I came ashore beside a flowering thicket

> shouting, but in a while they gave up looking,

> > > > Eumaeus, you replied,[ 360]{.calibre4}

> "Poor guest! Your tale of woe is very moving,

> Mesaulius served the food---that was the slave[ 450]{.calibre4}

[[The Prince Returns]{.calibre6}](#index_split_005.html_filepos4169)

> Athena went to Sparta, to ensure

> She found him with Pisistratus, both lying

> on Menelaus' porch, and Nestor's son

> was fast asleep, but no sweet slumber held

> Telemachus. His worries for his father

> kept him awake all through god-given night.

> Owl-eyed Athena stood by him and said,

> "Telemachus, you should no longer travel

> so far from home, abandoning your wealth,[ 10]{.calibre4}

> with greedy men at home. You must watch out;

> They may divide and eat up all your wealth,

> and make your journey useless. Quickly ask

> for help from Menelaus to get home,

> so you may find your mother safe and blameless.

> Her father and her brothers are already

> telling her she should wed Eurymachus.

> He is the one most generous with gifts

> to her and to her father. Do not let her

> take any items from the house, without[ 20]{.calibre4}

> your full consent. You know how women are---

> they want to help the house of any man

> they marry. When one darling husband dies,

> his wife forgets him, and her children by him.

> She does not even ask how they are doing.

> Let your best slave girl watch your property,

> until the gods give you your own wife. Also,

> I have more news: take note. There is a gang

> of suitors lurking in the stream between

> your Ithaca and rocky Same, who[ 30]{.calibre4}

> have plans to kill you on your journey home.

> But I suspect that some of those who waste

> your wealth will soon be lying under earth.

> Now steer your ship far distant from the islands,

> and sail both day and night. Some god who guards

> and watches over you will send fair wind

> behind your sails. When you first reach the shore

> of Ithaca, your men must drag the ship

> up to the town, while you first go and visit

> the swineherd, who is better than most slaves.[ 40]{.calibre4}

> Spend the night there. Tell him to go to town

> > > > > > With these words

> > > > > > The swineherd answered him,

> "Since you have asked this question, stranger, listen;

> enjoy my story, sitting quietly,[ 390]{.calibre4}

> with time enough to sleep and to enjoy

> hearing a tale. You need not sleep too early;

> of agony and absence from one's home,

> a person can begin enjoying grief.

> I will tell you my story as you ask.

> There is an island---you may know it---called

> Syria, where the sun turns round, above

> Ortygia. It has few inhabitants,

> but it is good land, rich in sheep and wine

> and grain; no famine ever hurts those there,

> nor any deadly sickness. They grow old,

> and with their gentle arrows, Artemis[ 410]{.calibre4}

> and silver-bowed Apollo cause their death.

> The land is split into two provinces;

> my father Ctesius was king of both.

> Then avaricious merchants came---Phoenicians,

> skilled sailors, with great piles of treasure stored

> in their black ship. And in my father's house

> there was a woman from Phoenicia---tall

> and beautiful and skilled in many arts.

> Those clever rascals tricked her. One of them

> first found her washing clothes beside the ship[ 420]{.calibre4}

> and lay with her. Sex sways all women's minds,

> even the best of them. And then he asked her

> where she was from and who she was; she showed him

> my father's palace, and she said, 'I am

> from Sidon, rich in bronze. I am the daughter

> of wealthy Arybas; as I was walking

> back from the fields one day, some Taphian pirates

> kidnapped me, brought me here to this man's house,

> and sold me to him, for a tidy sum.'

> Her secret lover said, 'Then would you like[ 430]{.calibre4}

> to go back home with us, and see your parents

> and your fine home again? They are alive

> and quite rich now.' The woman said, 'Oh, yes,

> I would! If all you sailors swear an oath

> to bring me safely home.' At that, they swore

> as she had asked, and made their solemn vows.

> And then the woman said, 'You must keep mum,

> and none of you can even speak to me

> if you bump into me beside the road

> or at the water fountain---otherwise[ 440]{.calibre4}

> someone might tell the old man at the house.

> Then he would get suspicious, chain me up,

> and plan to have you killed. Remember this,

> bear it in mind and do your trading quickly,

> and when your ship is full of stores to take

> back home with you, send news to me, and fast.

> I will bring gold with me as well, whatever

> wealth I can find to hand. I also want

> to give another gift to pay my fare.

> I take care of my master's clever son---[ 450]{.calibre4}

> who always runs around outside with me.

> I will bring him on board and he will fetch

> a pretty price from foreigners.' With that,

> they stayed with us accumulating wealth

> by trading, and they filled their ship's hold up.

> When it was time to go, they sent a man

> to tell the woman at my father's house.

> He was a very cunning man. He wore

> a golden necklace strung with amber beads;[ 460]{.calibre4}

> the slave girls in the palace and my mother

> stared and began to finger it and ask

> how much it cost; he nodded to the woman

> in silence, and then went back to the ship.

> She took me by the hand and led me out

> into the forecourt, where she found some cups

> left on the tables by my father's men

> who had been banqueting, and now had gone

> to council---they were having a debate.

> She took three cups and hid them in her dress[ 470]{.calibre4}

> and carried them away with her. I followed,

> knowing no better. As the sun went down,

> we hurried through the dark streets to the harbor.

> There was the swift Phoenician ship. They all

> over the watery waves; Zeus sent fair wind.

> For seven days we sailed and on the eighth,

> Artemis struck the woman with her arrows.

> She crashed into the ship's hold like a seagull.

> They threw her overboard to feed the fish[ 480]{.calibre4}

> and seals, and I was left there, brokenhearted.

> The current carried them to Ithaca,

> and then Laertes bought me with his wealth.

> That was the way my eyes first saw this land."

> Odysseus replied, "My heart is touched

> His heart was roused to rage; he wondered whether[ 10]{.calibre4}

> with those proud suitors---and his heart was barking,

> just as a mother dog will stand astride

> > > > > > So his heart held firm

> from heaven and stood near him, at his head,

> resembling a woman, and she said,

> "Why are you wide awake, unlucky man?

> Clever Odysseus said, "Goddess, yes,

> With glinting eyes Athena said, "So stubborn!

> Most men trust friends---even weaker, mortal friends,

> With that, the goddess drenched his eyes with sleep,

> Meanwhile, his faithful wife was wide awake,

[[An Archery Contest]{.calibre6}](#index_split_005.html_filepos4869)

> With glinting eyes, Athena put a thought

> into the mind of wise Penelope,

> the daughter of Icarius: to place

> the bow and iron axes in the hall

> of great Odysseus, and set the contest

> which would begin the slaughter. She went up

> to her own room. Her muscular, firm hand

> picked up the ivory handle of the key---

> a hook of bronze. Then with her slaves she walked

> down to the storeroom where the master kept[ 10]{.calibre4}

> his treasure: gold and bronze and well-wrought iron.

> The curving bow and deadly arrows lay there,

> given by Iphitus, Eurytus' son,

> the godlike man he happened to befriend

> at wise Ortilochus' house, far off

> in Lacedaemon, in Messenia.

> Odysseus had gone to claim a debt---

> some people of Messenia had come

> in rowing boats and poached three hundred sheep

> from Ithaca; they took their shepherds too.[ 20]{.calibre4}

> Laertes and the other older men

> had sent Odysseus to fetch them back

> when he was still a boy. And Iphitus

> had come there for his horses, twelve fine mares,

> each suckling a sturdy mule. These horses

> would later cause his death, when he had gone

> to visit Heracles, who welcomed him,

> but killed him, so that he could take the horses---

> betraying hospitality, and heedless

> about the watchful gods. Before all that,[ 30]{.calibre4}

> when Iphitus first met Odysseus,

> he gave this bow to him, inherited

> from his own father. And Odysseus

> gave Iphitus a sword and spear, to mark

> their bond. But Iphitus was dead before

> the friends could visit one another's houses.

> So when Odysseus' black fleet sailed

> to war, he did not take the bow, but stored it

> in his own house, to use in Ithaca

> in memory of his friend.

> > > > > > The queen had reached[ 40]{.calibre4}

> the storeroom, and she stepped across the threshold

> of polished oak; a skillful carpenter

> had set it level, fixed the frame, and built

> the dazzling double doors. She quickly loosed

> the door-thong from its hook, pushed in the key

> and with true aim, thrust back the fastenings.

> The fine doors, as the key struck home, began

> to bellow as a bull at pasture bellows.

> At once, they flew apart. She stepped inside,

> onto the pallet where the scented clothes[ 50]{.calibre4}

> were stored in chests, and reached to lift the bow

> down from its hook, still in its shining case.

> She sat down on the floor to take it out,

> resting it on her lap, and started sobbing

> and wailing as she saw her husband's bow.

> At last, she dried her eyes, and in her arms

> picked up the curving bow and quiver, packed

> with many deadly arrows, and she went

> to meet her arrogant suitors. Slaves lugged out

> a hamper with their master's many axes[ 60]{.calibre4}

> of bronze and iron, for the competition.

> The queen came near the suitors, and she stopped

> beside a pillar with a filmy veil

> across her face. Two slave girls stood with her.

> She said,

> > > "Now listen, lords. You keep on coming

> to this house every day, to eat and drink,

> wasting the wealth of someone who has been

> away too long. Your motives are no secret.

> You want to marry me. I am the prize.

> So I will set a contest. This great bow[ 70]{.calibre4}

> belonged to godlike King Odysseus.

> If anyone can grasp it in his hands

> and string it easily, and shoot through all

> twelve axes, I will marry him, and leave

> this beautiful rich house, so full of life,

> my lovely bridal home. I think I will

> remember it forever, even in

> my dreams."

> > > > She told Eumaeus he should set

> the bow and pale-gray iron axes up

> before the suitors, and in tears the swineherd[ 80]{.calibre4}

> took them, and did as she had asked. The cowherd

> wept also when he saw his master's bow.

> Antinous began to scold and taunt them.

> He said, "You idiots! You tactless peasants!

> So thoughtless, so undisciplined! You fools,

> your selfish crying is upsetting her!

> Poor lady, she is sad enough already

> at losing her beloved husband. Sit

> and eat in silence, or go do your wailing

> outside, and leave us suitors here to try[ 90]{.calibre4}

> the deadly contest of the bow. I think

> it will be difficult; not one of us

> can match Odysseus. I saw him once

> in childhood, and I still remember him."

> He hoped he would be first to string the bow

> and shoot through all the axes. But he would

> be first to taste an arrow from the hands

> of great Odysseus, whom he had mocked,

> urging the others on to do the same.

> Then Prince Telemachus addressed them all.[ 100]{.calibre4}

> "Zeus must have made me stupid! My dear mother,

> despite her usual common sense, has said

> that she will marry someone else and leave

> this house. But I am laughing, and my heart

> feels foolish gladness. Well, come on, you suitors.

> You want this prize---a woman unlike any

> in holy Pylos, Argos or Mycenae,

> or here in Ithaca or on the mainland.

> No woman in Achaea is like her.

> There is no need for me to praise my mother.[ 110]{.calibre4}

> You know her worth. So do not make excuses,

> do not put off the contest of the bow.

> We want to watch. And I will try myself.

> If I succeed in stringing it and shooting

> all through, I will no longer mind if Mother

> goes off with someone else, and leaves me here.

> Success would prove me man enough to carry

> my father's arms."

> > > > > He stood up straight and tall,

> tossed off his purple cloak, unstrapped his sword,

> and dug a trench to set the axes up,[ 120]{.calibre4}

> all in a line, and trod the earth down flat.

> They were amazed to see him work so neatly,

> though he had never seen it done before.

> He stood astride the threshold and began

> to try the bow. Three times his muscles trembled,

> straining to draw it back; three times he failed

> to string the bow and shoot all through the axes.

> He would have tried a fourth time; he was keen

> to keep on pulling. But Odysseus

> shook his head, stopping him. Telemachus[ 130]{.calibre4}

> said,

> > "Ugh! It seems that I will always be

> too weak and useless. Or perhaps I am

> too young and inexperienced at fighting

> in self-defense when someone starts a quarrel.

> You all are stronger than I am. You try,

> and we can end the contest."

> > > > > > With these words,

> he set the bow down on the floor, propped up

> against the polished, jointed double door,

> and tucked the arrow up against the handle.

> He sat back down where he had sat before.[ 140]{.calibre4}

> Antinous called out, "Now, friends, get up,

> from left to right, beginning with the man

> next to the wine-slave!"

> > > > > > They agreed. The first
>
> []{#index_split_034.html_filepos1468150}

> was Leodes, their holy man, who always

> sat in the farthest corner, by the wine-bowl.

> He was the only one who disapproved

> of all their bullying. He grasped the bow

> and stood astride the threshold, and he tried

> to string it, but he failed. His hands were soft,

> untrained by labor, and he grew worn out[ 150]{.calibre4}

> trying to pull it back. He told the suitors,

> "My friends, I cannot do it. Someone else

> should have a turn. This bow will take away

> courage, life-force, and energy from many

> noble young men; but better we should die,

> than live and lose the goal for which we gather

> to court some other fine, well-dressed Greek lady.

> And after that, Penelope will marry

> > > > > > With these words,

> Antinous responded with a jeer.

> "My goodness, Leodes! What scary words!

> All your tough talk has made me really angry.[ 170]{.calibre4}

> You cannot string the bow, so you are claiming

> that it will take the life from proper men.

> You surely were not born for archery.

> The rest of us are actual warriors;

> > > > > > He told the goatherd,

> "Melanthius, come on now, light a fire

> and pull a chair beside it, with a fleece,

> and bring out from the pantry a big hunk

> of fat, so we young men can warm the bow,

> grease it, and try it, and so end this contest."[ 180]{.calibre4}

> Melanthius obeyed at once; he lit

> a blazing fire, and pulled a chair beside it,

> spreading a fleece on top, and brought the wheel

> of fat. The young men warmed the bow, but still

> Antinous and Eurymachus, the leaders,

> had still not had their turn.

> > > > > > Meanwhile the swineherd

> Odysseus himself came after them,[ 190]{.calibre4}

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> "Cowherd and swineherd, I am hesitating

> > > > > > The cowherd said,

> "O Father Zeus, please make this wish come true,[ 200]{.calibre4}

> I see that you two are the only slaves

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

[[Bloodshed]{.calibre6}](#index_split_005.html_filepos4987)

> Odysseus ripped off his rags. Now naked,

> he leapt upon the threshold with his bow

> and quiverfull of arrows, which he tipped

> out in a rush before his feet, and spoke.

> "Playtime is over. I will shoot again,

> towards another mark no man has hit.

> Apollo, may I manage it!"

> > > > > > He aimed

> his deadly arrow at Antinous.

> The young man sat there, just about to lift

> his golden goblet, swirling wine around,[ 10]{.calibre4}

> ready to drink. He had no thought of death.

> How could he? Who would think a single man,

> among so many banqueters, would dare

> to risk dark death, however strong he was?

> Odysseus aimed at his throat, then shot.

> The point pierced all the way through his soft neck.

> He flopped down to the side and his cup slipped

> out of his hand, and then thick streams of blood

> gushed from his nostrils. His foot twitched and knocked

> the table down; food scattered on the ground.[ 20]{.calibre4}

> The bread and roasted meat were soiled with blood.

> Seeing him fall, the suitors, in an uproar,

> with shouts that filled the hall, jumped up and rushed

> to search around by all the thick stone walls

> for shields or swords to grab---but there were none.

> They angrily rebuked Odysseus.

> "Stranger, you shot a man, and you will pay!

> You will join no more games---you have to die!

> For certain! You have killed the best young man

> in all of Ithaca. Right here, the vultures[ 30]{.calibre4}

> will eat your corpse." Those poor fools did not know

> that he had killed Antinous on purpose,

> nor that the snares of death were round them all.

> Clever Odysseus scowled back and sneered,

> "Dogs! So you thought I would not come back home

> from Troy? And so you fleeced my house, and raped

> my slave girls, and you flirted with my wife

> while I am still alive! You did not fear

> the gods who live in heaven, and you thought

> no man would ever come to take revenge.[ 40]{.calibre4}

> Now you are trapped inside the snares of death."

> At that, pale fear seized all of them. They groped

> to find a way to save their lives somehow.

> Only Eurymachus found words to answer.

> "If it is you, Odysseus, come back,

> then we agree! Quite right, the Greeks have done

> outrageous things to your estate and home.

> But now the one responsible is dead---

> Antinous! It was all his idea.

> He did not even really want your wife,[ 50]{.calibre4}

> but had another plan, which Zeus has foiled:

> to lie in ambush for your son, and kill him,

> then seize the throne and rule in Ithaca.

> Now he is slain---quite rightly. Please, my lord,

> have mercy on your people! We will pay

> in public, yes, for all the food and drink.

> We each will bring the price of twenty oxen,

> and pay you all the gold and bronze you want.

> Your anger is quite understandable."

> Odysseus saw through him; with a glare[ 60]{.calibre4}

> he told him, "Even if you give me all

> your whole inheritance, and even more,

> I will not keep my hands away from slaughter

> until I pay you suitors back for all

> your wickedness. You have two choices: fight,

> or run away: just try to save your lives!

> Not one of you will get away from death."

> At that their knees grew weak, their hearts stopped still.

> Eurymachus again addressed the suitors.

> "My friends, this man will not hold back his hands.[ 70]{.calibre4}

> Seizing the bow and arrows, he will shoot us

> right from that polished threshold, till he kills

> each one of us. Be quick, make plans for battle.

> Draw out your swords, use tables as your shields

> against the deadly arrows. All together,

> rush at him, try to drive him off the threshold,

> and out of doors, then run all through the town,

> and quickly call for help. This man will soon

> have shot his last!"

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> > > > > He drew his sharp bronze sword

> and with a dreadful scream he leapt at him.[ 80]{.calibre4}

> But that same instant, Lord Odysseus

> let fly and hit his chest, beside the nipple,

> and instantly the arrow pierced his liver.

> The sword fell from his hand. He doubled up

> and fell across the table, spilling food

> and wine across the floor. He smashed his head

> against the ground, and in his desperate pain

> kicked up the chair, and darkness drenched his eyes.

> Amphinomus attacked Odysseus.

> He drew his sharp sword, hoping he could force him[ 90]{.calibre4}

> to yield his place. Telemachus leapt in

> and thrust his bronze spear through him from behind,

> ramming it through his back and out his chest.

> Face-first he crashed and thudded to the ground.

> Telemachus dashed back---he left his spear

> stuck in the body; he was terrified

> that if he bent to pull it out, some Greek

> would jump on him and stab him with a sword.

> He ran and quickly reached his loyal father.

> He stood beside him and his words flew out.[ 100]{.calibre4}

> "Now Father, I will fetch a shield for you

> and two spears and a helmet made of bronze,

> and I will arm myself, and bring more arms

> for our two herdsmen, since we all need weapons."

> Odysseus, the master planner, answered,

> "Run fast while I still have a stock of arrows,

> before they force me from the doors---I am

> fighting alone up here."

![](images/00006.jpg){.calibre_36}

> > > > > > His son obeyed.

> He hurried to the storeroom for the arms,

> and took eight spears, four shields, and four bronze helmets[ 110]{.calibre4}

> each fitted out with bushy horsehair plumes.

> He hurried back to take them to his father,

> and was the first to strap the armor on.

> The two slaves also armed themselves, and stood

> flanking their brilliant, resourceful leader.

> As long as he had arrows, he kept shooting,

> and one by one he picked the suitors off,

> inside his own home. Then at last the king

> ran out of arrows; he set down his bow

> next to the sturdy doorpost, leaning up[ 120]{.calibre4}

> against the palace walls, all shining white.

> He slung the four-fold shield across his shoulders,

> and put the well-made helmet on his head.

> The crest of horsehair gave a fearsome nod.

> He grasped a bronze-tipped spear in either hand.

> There was a back gate in the castle walls,

> providing access to the passageway,

> with tightly fitted doors. Odysseus

> ordered the noble swineherd to stand there

> to guard it---there was only one way out.[ 130]{.calibre4}

> Agelaus called out to all the suitors.

> "Friends, one of us should slip out through that gate

> and quickly tell the people, raise alarms.

> That soon would put a stop to this man's shooting."

> Melanthius the goatherd answered, "No!

> My lord, that entryway is much too narrow,

> and dangerously near the palace doors.

> One man, if he was brave, could keep it guarded

> against us all. So I will bring you armor

> out of the storeroom, which I think is where[ 140]{.calibre4}

> those two, our enemies, have hidden it."

> Melanthius the goatherd climbed up past

> the arrow-slits inside the castle walls,

> into the chamber. There he took twelve shields,

> twelve spears and twelve bronze helmets, each one crested

> with horsehair. Then he hurried back downstairs

> and handed all the weapons to the suitors.

> Odysseus could see that they had arms;

> their spears were brandished. His heart stopped, his legs

> trembled---he was so shocked at their presumption.[ 150]{.calibre4}

> At once his words flew out to tell his son,

> "One of the women, or Melanthius,

> is waging war against us, in my house!"

> Wisely Telemachus owned up at once.

> "Father, it was my fault, I am to blame.

> I left the heavy storeroom door ajar.

> Someone on their side must have kept good watch.

> Go there, Eumaeus, shut the door, and see

> if any of the women are against us,

> or else, as I suspect, Melanthius."[ 160]{.calibre4}

> Meanwhile, Melanthius was going back

> to get more weapons from the room. The swineherd

> saw him and told Odysseus,

> > > > > > "My Lord,

> that little sneak, the man we all suspected,

> is going to the stores! Odysseus,

> you always have a plan for what to do:

> so should I kill him, as I think is best,

> or bring him here to you, so you can punish

> his many crimes against you in your house?"

> Odysseus already had a plan.[ 170]{.calibre4}

> "Telemachus and I will keep the suitors

> trapped in the hall---however much they rage.

> You two, truss up his hands and feet behind him,

> drag him inside the storeroom, string him up,

> tying a knotted rope high on the column,

> and hoist him to the rafters. Torture him

> with hours of agony before he dies."

> His word was their command; they hurried off,

> and reached the weaponry. Melanthius

> was unaware of them. As he was searching[ 180]{.calibre4}

> for arms, they stopped on each side of the door

> and waited. When he stepped across the threshold,

> holding a lovely helmet in one hand,

> and in the other hand, a rusty shield,

> once carried by Laertes in his youth,

> but now in storage, with its seams all loose.

> The two men jumped on him and grabbed his hair

> to drag him in and threw him on the floor,

> shaking with fear. They bound his hands and feet

> and yanked them painfully behind his back,[ 190]{.calibre4}

> just as the lord of suffering had told them.

> They tied him with a knotted rope and hoisted

> his body up the column to the rafters.

> Swineherd Eumaeus, you began to mock him:

> "Keep watch the whole night through, Melanthius,

> tucked up in this soft bed---it serves you right!

> And wait there for the golden throne of Dawn

> leaving the sea, that hour when you would lead

> your goats to this house for the suitors' dinner."

> There he was left, bound cruelly and stretched.[ 200]{.calibre4}

> The herdsmen armed themselves and left the room,

> shutting the door, and joined their cunning leader.

> They stood there on the threshold, tense with purpose,

> just four against so many men inside.

> The child of Zeus, Athena, came to meet them;

> her voice and looks resembled those of Mentor.

> Odysseus was happy when he saw her,

> and said, "Remember our old friendship, Mentor!

> I have been good to you since we were boys.

> So help me now!" He guessed it was Athena,[ 210]{.calibre4}

> who rouses armies.

> > > > > From the hall, the suitors

> shouted their opposition. Agelaus

> called, "Mentor, do not let Odysseus

> sway you to help him and to fight against us.

> I think this is how things will go. When we

> have killed this father and his son, you will

> die also, if you do as you intend,

> and pay with your own life for all your plots.

> Our bronze will strip your life away from you,

> and we will seize whatever you may own[ 220]{.calibre4}

> and mix it with the loot we get from here.

> Your sons will not survive here in these halls,

> nor will your wife and daughters still walk free

> in Ithaca."

> > > At that Athena's heart

> became enraged, and angrily she scolded

> Odysseus. "Where is your courage now?

> You fought nine years on end against the Trojans,

> for white-armed Helen, Zeus' favorite child.

> You slaughtered many men when war was raging,

> and formed the plan that made the city fall.[ 230]{.calibre4}

> Now you are home at last, how can you flinch

> from being brave and using proper force

> against these suitors? Come now, stand by me

> and watch how Mentor, son of Alcimus,

> will treat your enemies as recompense

> for all your service."

> > > > > > But she did not grant

> decisive victory; she kept on testing

> Odysseus' courage, and his son's.

> She flew up like a swallow through the smoke

> and nestled in the rafters of the roof.[ 240]{.calibre4}

> Now Agelaus, Demoptolemus,

> Eurynomus, Pisander, Amphimedon,

> and Polybus were urging on the suitors.

> Those were the most heroic of the group

> who still survived and battled for their lives:

> the others were defeated by the bow

> and raining arrows. Agelaus told them,

> "That Mentor's boasts were empty, friends! He left,

> and they are all alone there at the entrance.

> Now force this cruel man to stay his hands.[ 250]{.calibre4}

> Do not hurl spears at him all in a mass,

> but you six must shoot first and pray Lord Zeus

> we strike Odysseus and win the fight.

> Once he is down, the others will be nothing."

> The six men threw their spears as he had said;

> at once Athena made their efforts fail.

> One pierced the doorpost of the palace hall,

> another hit the closely fitted door,

> another's spear of ash and heavy bronze

> fell on the wall. The group of four avoided[ 260]{.calibre4}

> > > > > > "My friends," he said,

> "they want to slaughter us and strip our arms!

> Avenge my former wrongs, and save your lives!

> Now shoot!"

> > > > They hurled their spears at once and hit.

> Odysseus killed Demoptolemus;

> Telemachus, Euryades; the swineherd

> slaughtered Elatus, and the cowherd killed

> Pisander. They all fell and bit the earth.

> The other suitors huddled in a corner;[ 270]{.calibre4}

> the four rushed up and from the corpses pulled

> Ctesippus hurled his spear; it only scratched

> flew past and fell down on the floor behind him.[ 280]{.calibre4}

> The competent, sharp-eyed Odysseus

> and his companions hurled their piercing spears

> into the swarming throng. The city-sacker

> skewered Eurydamas; Telemachus

> slashed Amphimedon, and the swineherd struck

> But Eurycleia answered with affection,

> "Dear child, I am not mocking you. I am

> He is the stranger that they all abused.

> Telemachus has known for quite some time,[ 30]{.calibre4}

> Penelope said carefully, "Do not[ 60]{.calibre4}

> However, what you say cannot be true.

> Odysseus was quick to form a plan.

> He told him, "Here is what I think is best.

> The three of you should wash and change your clothes,[ 130]{.calibre4}

> and make the slave girls go put on clean dresses.

> Then let the godlike singer take the lyre

> and play a clear and cheerful dancing tune,

> They did as Lord Odysseus had said. [ 140]{.calibre4}

> They washed and changed their tunics, and the slave girls

> prepared themselves. The singer took the lyre,

> and roused in them desire to hear sweet music,

> and dance. The house resounded with the thump

> of beating feet from all the dancing men

> and girls in pretty sashes. Those outside

> "So somebody is marrying the queen

> who had so many suitors! Headstrong woman!

> She must have lacked the strength to wait it out[ 150]{.calibre4}

> and keep her husband's house safe till he came."

> They spoke with no idea what really happened.

> Eurynome the slave woman began

> to wash strong-willed Odysseus. She rubbed him

> and handsome cloak. And then Athena poured

> attractiveness from head to toe, and made him

> taller and stronger, and his hair grew thick

> Inside the court there grew an olive tree

> and planed it down and skillfully transformed

> the trunk into a bedpost. With a drill,

> I bored right through it. This was my first bedpost,

> and then I made the other three, inlaid

> with gold and silver and with ivory. [ 200]{.calibre4}

> > > > > > At that,

> She burst out crying and ran straight towards him

> Odysseus! In every other way

> Actoris, whom my father gave to me[ 230]{.calibre4}

> when I came here, who used to guard our room.

> It is a shroud for when Laertes dies,

## BOOK 1 SUMMARY {#index_split_039.html_calibre_pb_39 .calibre8}

[The poet invokes the Muse. The gods hold a council: Athena appeals to Zeus about Odysseus, who is trapped far from home, on the island of the nymph Calypso. Zeus promises to send Hermes, the messenger god, to make Calypso help Odysseus go home. Athena goes to Ithaca in the guise of Mentor and inspires Telemachus, assuring him that his father is alive. Then she flies away, like a bird. The singer, Phemius, begins to sing about Troy; Penelope is made upset by the topic, and tries to stop him. Telemachus, to her surprise, intervenes, scolds her, and makes her go upstairs. Telemachus announces that he will be calling a meeting the next day. Antinous and Eurymachus speak to him nastily and try to find out who Athena was.]{.calibre9}

## BOOK 2 SUMMARY {#index_split_040.html_calibre_pb_41 .calibre8}

[Telemachus calls an assembly and speaks to the elite men of Ithaca about the trouble caused him by the suitors. Antinous, a leading suitor, explains Penelope's trick with the loom. Zeus sends two eagles that attack the faces of the men in the crowd, and an Ithacan named Halitherses explains that this is a prophecy that Odysseus is on his way home. Mentor speaks up for Telemachus; the suitors (Eurymachus and Leocritus) resist the warnings. Telemachus asks for a ship to travel in search of news about his father. He prays for Athena's help; disguised as Mentor, she appears to him and promises to help him and equip a ship for him. At dinner, the suitors tease Telemachus. He slips out secretly, gets provisions with the help of Eurycleia, and goes down to the shore, where Athena, disguised as Mentor, has prepared the ship, borrowed from Noëmon, and assembled a crew. They pack up and set sail.]{.calibre9}

## BOOK 3 SUMMARY {#index_split_041.html_calibre_pb_43 .calibre8}

[Telemachus reaches Pylos, home of old King Nestor, where he receives a warm welcome. Nestor tells how the Greeks destroyed Troy, and then were cursed by Athena. The brothers Agamemnon and Menelaus quarreled, the troops split up, and the fleet was scattered on their homeward journey. Nestor himself reached home safely; Agamemnon was killed by Aegisthus, who had seduced his wife; Menelaus was swept off to Egypt by a storm. Nestor warns Telemachus to remember the story of Aegisthus, and be wary. He advises him to go visit Menelaus, and then go back home. Nestor insists that Telemachus must stay the night, and sends him off in the morning with gifts, a carriage to get to Sparta, and his son Pisistratus as a companion.]{.calibre9}

[Telemachus and Pisistratus find Menelaus and Helen in their rich home at Sparta, in the midst of a lavish celebration of the marriages of Menelaus' two children. They are welcomed warmly; Menelaus tells the story of his long journey back from Troy, expressing grief for those who died and were lost---especially, his brother Agamemnon and his dear friend Odysseus. Telemachus starts crying. Helen appears and identifies Telemachus; Pisistratus explains the reason for their visit. Everyone weeps about the absence of Odysseus, but Pisistratus intervenes and Helen pours a magical drug into the wine to remove all capacity for grief. She describes how Odysseus at Troy disguised himself and snuck through the city on a spy mission; Menelaus tells how determined he was inside the Wooden Horse. They all go to sleep. In the morning, Menelaus tells the story of how, on his way back from Troy, he stopped and accrued wealth in Egypt, and then met and temporarily captured Proteus, the old sea god, who gave him some news of his fellow warriors, such as the murdered Agamemnon. Menelaus offers Telemachus fine gifts to take home. Meanwhile, on Ithaca, the suitors discover about the boy's trip and plot to kill Telemachus on his return journey. Penelope also finds out and is full of grief. The suitors set up the ambush. Athena sends a dream phantom to comfort Penelope.]{.calibre9}

[Zeus and Athena again discuss the fate of Odysseus; Zeus sends Athena to protect Telemachus, and Hermes to rescue Odysseus from Calypso. Hermes tells Calypso to let Odysseus go; reluctantly, she agrees. Odysseus constructs a raft and almost reaches Phaeacia, when Poseidon spots him and sends a storm to wreck the raft. Odysseus is helped by Ino, the White Goddess. He clings to a plank from the broken raft, and then swims towards shore. With the aid of Athena, he finds a good place to rest, in a gentle river's mouth. He crawls out of the water, hides in some bushes, and goes to sleep.]{.calibre9}

Then Laodamas, Alcinous' youngest son, invites Odysseus to participate; another son, Euryalus, taunts Odysseus that he is no athlete. Odysseus hurls a discus far beyond the others and is congratulated by Athena in disguise. Demodocus sings a second, longer song, about the adulterous affair of Aphrodite and Ares; Odysseus is pleased. The Phaeacians give Odysseus lavish gifts, bathe him, and feed him.

## BOOK 9 SUMMARY {#index_split_047.html_calibre_pb_55 .calibre8}

[Odysseus begins to tell his story. He tells how, after sacking Troy, he and his fleet were blown off course. They reached the land of the Cicones, where they sacked the city, killed the men, and enslaved the women as concubines. Odysseus' party remained on the shore, drinking; the Cicones retaliated, and some of Odysseus' men were killed. Another storm struck the fleet, and the ships reached the land of the Lotus-Eaters, who tempted some of the men to eat the lotus fruit and forget all thoughts of home. Odysseus ordered the whole crew back on board. They reached the island of the Cyclopes, where they found a cave inhabited by a large, solitary shepherd, named Polyphemus. Odysseus left most of his crew with the ships, taking twelve men and a sack of special wine with him to visit the native inhabitant. Finding him absent, they broke into the cave; the men tried to persuade Odysseus to steal Polyphemus' cheese and animals and then make a quick escape. Odysseus insisted on staying. When the Cyclops came home, Odysseus demanded a gift; Polyphemus refused and ate two of the men; he then went to sleep. The door-stone of the cave was too heavy for the men to move, so they were trapped inside. Next morning, Polyphemus ate two more men, and then set out for pasture with his flock. Odysseus prepared a sharp olive wood stake to blind Polyphemus. When the Cyclops returned, he ate two more men; Odysseus then offered him some wine. He drank too much. Odysseus claimed his name is "Noman." When the Cyclops passed out, Odysseus and his men shoved the stake into his eye. Polyphemus called for help, but no one came, because he said that "No man" has hurt him. Next morning, the blinded Cyclops opened the door-stone, counting the sheep and goats as he let them out to pasture. Odysseus and his men escaped by clinging to the animals' bellies. As they sailed away, Odysseus shouted back to taunt Polyphemus and revealed his true name. Polyphemus hurled a huge rock that almost destroyed the ship and called on his father Poseidon to curse Odysseus.]{.calibre9}

[The fleet reached the floating island of Aeolus, guardian of the winds, who gave Odysseus a bag containing multiple winds as a gift to help him on his way. The fleet almost reached Ithaca, but Odysseus fell asleep at the rudder. The men, jealous that Odysseus was acquiring all the treasure on the trip and sharing none of it, opened the bag of winds, and the ship was blasted back to Aeolus' palace, from which they are then sent harshly away. They reached the land of Laestrygonia, and all the men except Odysseus moored inside the harbor. The inhabitants turned out to be cannibal giants, who skewered all those in the harbor and ate them. The lone remaining ship sailed to the land of Circe, who turned half of Odysseus' men into pigs. With the help of Hermes, Odysseus managed to persuade Circe to turn them back into human form. They all stayed with Circe for a year, recuperating. Then Odysseus asked Circe to help them on their way, but she told him they must first visit the house of Hades and consult the dead spirit of the prophet Tiresias, who would advise him about his journey. Before they left, the youngest crew member, Elpenor, fell from the attic in Circe's house and died.]{.calibre9}

[They reached the dark land of the Cimmerians, and Odysseus performed a sacrifice, praying to reach his homeland. He dug a ditch and filled it with blood; the spirits of the dead appeared. First was Elpenor, who asked for proper burial. Next came the spirit of Anticleia, Odysseus' mother; but Odysseus spoke first to the prophet Tiresias, who foretold many dangers ahead. Odysseus spoke to his mother, wept for her death, and tried to embrace her, but she slipped away. Then came a parade of famous mythical women, all associated with even more famous male heroes and gods. Odysseus pauses his story, but Alcinous begs him to continue. He tells of meeting the ghost of Agamemnon, who told him how he was murdered, and the ghost of Achilles, who regretted trading his life for honor. The ghost of Ajax refused to speak to Odysseus. After glimpsing other male heroes, seeing the torments of the dead, and speaking to Heracles, Odysseus returned to his ship.]{.calibre9}

[Back on Circe's island, they held a funeral for Elpenor. Circe gave Odysseus advice about his route. They sailed past the Sirens; Odysseus, tied to the mast, was the only one who heard their song. They reached the six-headed Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis; Scylla devoured six men. They were marooned on the island of Helius, the Sun God, and the men were half starved; while Odysseus napped, they killed the forbidden cattle and ate them. When they left, Zeus wrecked the ship and all the men drowned. Odysseus, the sole survivor, was swept back; he clung to a fig tree above the whirlpool Charybdis, then jumped into the water, clutched a broken ship's timber, and managed to row out of the way of Scylla. After ten days of drifting, he reached the island of Calypso; and so the story of the wanderings comes full circle.]{.calibre9}

When the ship approaches Phaeacia, Poseidon wrecks it, turns it to stone, and threatens to cover the country with a mountain.

Eumaeus expresses his loyalty to his master and grief for his supposed death; Odysseus predicts the return of Odysseus.

Eumaeus responds that he does not believe Odysseus is en route; he explains his skepticism of tricksters.

While boarding, he meets Theoclymenus, who is in exile for murder and is exceptionally skilled at prophecy. Meanwhile, in the swineherd's cottage, Eumaeus urges Odysseus to stay with him rather than go into town to beg. He shares news of Odysseus' parents and tells the story of how he himself, born into a king's family, was enslaved as a little child, bought by Laertes, and raised by Anticleia alongside Odysseus' own sister.

Athena transforms Odysseus, so he looks young and strong again; he tells the startled Telemachus who he really is. After weeping together, they start making plans for how to kill the suitors. Odysseus tells Telemachus he must hide almost all the weapons, so that the suitors will be unarmed, and must keep his father's identity secret, even from Laertes and Penelope. Telemachus explains how many suitors there are and proposes a slight modification of Odysseus' plan. Meanwhile, news reaches the palace that Telemachus has come back safe. The suitors are angry at the foiling of their plan to murder him, but continue to scheme. Amphinomus speaks against killing the boy. Penelope speaks out against the suitors, then goes upstairs. Eumaeus returns to his cottage, telling Telemachus and Odysseus that the suitors have returned from their failed attempt at ambush. They eat and sleep.]{.calibre9}

Melanthius returns to the palace and eats. Argos, the old dog left behind by Odysseus as a puppy twenty years earlier, recognizes his master and then dies. Odysseus enters his own home as a beggar. Telemachus gives him food and tells him to beg from all the suitors. They each give him scraps, except Antinous, who hurls a footstool at him. Odysseus curses him, and the others reproach Antinous. Telemachus sneezes. Penelope invites the supposed beggar to talk to her, promising him new clothes if he tells her the truth about any news he has of Odysseus.

[Odysseus, still in his guise as a beggar, encounters a real beggar, Irus, at the palace, who taunts him. Challenged by the suitors, they fight, and Odysseus wins; the suitors reward him with a meal. Odysseus tells Amphinomus, a kind suitor, a false autobiographical story of which the moral is that the suitors will be punished when Odysseus comes back: "there will be blood." Amphinomus almost heeds the warning, but Athena makes him stay in the palace to die. Penelope is inspired by Athena to show herself in her full beauty to the suitors; she comes downstairs and reproaches Telemachus for his treatment of the beggar, and declares that she must soon marry one of the suitors.

Penelope tells Odysseus about her weaving trick, which held the suitors at bay for a while. Odysseus tells her a false autobiographical story, claiming to come from Crete and to know Odysseus. She weeps. Odysseus promises that Odysseus will be home within the month. Penelope offers him a nice bed with clean sheets; he refuses, saying he is used to sleeping rough, but he is willing to let an old slave women wash his feet. Eurycleia, the old nurse, washes Odysseus, finds the scar on his leg from an old hunting wound, and recognizes him. He got the scar on a trip to his grandfather Autolycus, who named him as a baby. Odysseus makes Eurycleia keep the secret of his identity. Penelope tells Odysseus of her suffering and also of her dream about the geese killed by an eagle. Odysseus is glad.

[Odysseus lies at the entrance of the palace and is aware of slave women slipping out to meet the suitors. He is enraged, but Athena calms him, promising to protect him and his interests. Penelope weeps and prays. Odysseus hears his wife weeping as he wakes up. He prays and hears a slave praying for an end to the suitors' banquets. Telemachus wakes and worries that his mother has failed to treat his father properly; Eurycleia reassures him. Under her supervision, the slaves prepare the house for a special feast day. Melanthius the goatherd appears and insults Odysseus. Another herdsman, Philoetius, arrives and speaks politely to Odysseus. Philoetius and Eumaeus both swear their loyalty to their master. The suitors reconsider the plan to kill Telemachus, following the advice of Amphinomus. Telemachus helps Odysseus to food and warns the suitors not to abuse him. One of them, Ctesippus, hurls an ox-foot at Odysseus. Telemachus speaks out against their behavior. Athena makes the suitors laugh unstoppably; after the prophet Theoclymenus foretells their death, he leaves the house. The suitors tease Telemachus, who does not react; he and Odysseus wait for their moment.]{.calibre9}

[Penelope takes the storeroom key and fetches Odysseus' bow; her slaves bring the axes. Telemachus tries the bow first and fails to string it; Odysseus makes him stop trying. Leodes, the suitors' prophet, tries and fails. Antinous sneers, and asks Melanthius to light a fire and bring some fat, to grease the bow. Even so, they fail to string the bow; only Antinous and Eurymachus have still not tried it when they stop. Meanwhile, Odysseus reveals himself to Eumaeus and Philoetius. Eurymachus fails to string the bow. Antinous uses the excuse of the feast day to Apollo (god of archery) to put off the contest. Odysseus suggests that, while waiting for the real contest the next day, they should let him try the bow. Antinous and Eurymachus speak against allowing it; Penelope speaks up for the beggar; Telemachus scolds her and sends her upstairs. Eumaeus gives Odysseus the bow. Eurycleia locks up the women in their quarters; Philoetius secures the gate of the house. Odysseus effortlessly strings the bow and shoots through all the axes.]{.calibre9}

[Eurycleia tells Penelope that the old beggar is really Odysseus, and that he has killed all the suitors. She is reluctant to believe her slave. Telemachus scolds her. Odysseus tells him they will recognize each other in time, through secret signs; meanwhile, they must make noise as if of a wedding party, to delay the moment when the people of Ithaca realize what has been done to the suitors. Penelope, testing Odysseus, tells Eurycleia to pull the bed frame out of the room and make up the bed for the guest. Odysseus is horrified and tells the story of how he built the bed himself, using a still-living tree that grows in the middle of the palace. Penelope acknowledges him as her husband. They weep. Odysseus tells her about his next journey, to the land of people who do not know the sea. They go to bed together. He tells her an edited version of his adventures.

[Hermes leads the spirits of the dead suitors down to Hades. Achilles and Agamemnon are conversing; Agamemnon tells Achilles about Achilles' funeral. Agamemnon greets the dead suitors; Amphimedon, a suitor, tells how they died. Agamemnon expresses jealousy of Odysseus for having a loyal wife, unlike his own, who killed him. Odysseus goes to the countryside and meets his old father, Laertes, in his orchard. He pretends to think Laertes is a slave and makes up a fake story about his own identity, claiming to be a guest-friend of Odysseus. Laertes is overwhelmed by grief. Odysseus at last reveals his identity, proving it with a childhood memory of being taught about all the trees in the orchard. When they return to the hut, Odysseus reveals himself to the slaves. Meanwhile, news of the suitors' murder has got out. The people gather in outrage outside the palace, and Eupeithes, the bereaved father of Antinous, speaks out against Odysseus. Old Halitherses tries to restrain the crowd, reminding them that the suitors behaved badly and fighting is risky. But over half still want to fight. Athena and Zeus agree that Odysseus should be appointed as king in Ithaca and there should be peace. Odysseus, his son, his father, and his slaves all arm; Athena, disguised as Mentor, joins them. They begin killing. Eupeithes dies first, and all the rebel Ithacans would have been slaughtered, but Athena intervenes and stops the bloodshed, even though Odysseus himself is eager to keep killing.]{.calibre9}

[[ACKNOWLEDGMENTS]{.calibre2}](#index_split_005.html_filepos5529)

First thanks go to Pete Simon at Norton, whose wonderful idea it was that I should translate the [Odyssey]{.italic}. Pete is an amazing editor who combed through my first drafts of every book with an unfailingly keen ear for clarity, English idiom, and poetic impact, and inspired me to keep at it. This book would not exist without him.

In the process of planning and creating this translation, I have shared pieces of my work in progress, as well as thoughts about the process, with engaged and helpful audiences at several institutions. I will not be able to thank by name all those who asked questions and made useful comments on those occasions, but I would like to extend a general and heartfelt thank you to those who invited me, listened to me, and engaged with me, at the Barnard Center for Translation Studies; classics graduate students at City University of New York; undergraduates and faculty at Swarthmore College (especially Rosaria Munson and Grace Ledbetter); various people at Columbia University (especially Julie Crawford, Jenny Davidson, and Molly Murray), and the Department of Languages and Cultures at the University of Delaware. I was lucky to be able to participate in a Penn Alumni Travel cruise round Sicily and the coast of Italy toward the end of this project; I am grateful to Emilie de la Rosa for inviting me, and to all my fellow passengers for discussing Homer with me while we sailed past the land of the Cyclops.

In my home institution, the Penn Humanities Forum provided two years of partial course relief and the stimulating company of two very different but equally impressive groups of scholars in the humanities; the [Odyssey]{.italic} was part of the Year of Violence and then, equally suitably, the Year of Sex. I am grateful to all those who participated in those groups and helped expand my mind, with particular gratitude to Jennifer Conway, Jim English, David Stern, and Zeb Tortorici. Thanks also to the members of the Penn Undergraduate Humanities Forum on Translation, and to Andrea Goulet for inviting me to speak with them; to the lively students of the Penn Philomathean Society; and to all the students in Peter Struck's [Iliad]{.italic} class, as well as Peter himself. Warm thanks to all those who attended my Library Tea presentation at Van Pelt here at Penn, and especially to Rebecca Stuhr, our classical studies librarian, who has been an engaged and thoughtful interlocutor for this project. Thank you also to all the graduate students who took my seminar on Greek poetry in translation.

I presented pieces of this project at two different Penn Classical Studies Colloquia, and am grateful to the audience members who asked useful questions on both occasions. I have benefited enormously from the company of my colleagues at Penn, especially those in the Classical Studies Department. I owe particular thanks to Bridget Murnaghan, magnificent Homerist and fellow translator, who generously read and commented on the majority of this volume, and who has taught me an enormous amount about the values and narrative strategies of the [Odyssey]{.italic}. Thank you to all those faculty, graduate students, and post-bac students who regularly showed up, in the middle of their own busy weeks, to listen to me reading books-in-progress at "Homer Reading Group," and offer comments, questions, and suggestions for improvement. Particular thanks to my colleague Cynthia Damon, for wonderfully incisive questions about characterization, tone, and narrative perspective. Thank you to all the graduate students who participated in this context, including but not limited to: Lucy Ayers, Amelia Bensch-Schaus, Wes Hanson, Amy Lewis, Daniel Mackey, Isabella Reinhardt, and Jeffrey Ulrich. Thank you also to all the occasional visitors to the group, including Rita Copeland, Seth Schein, and Mira Seo.

In the final stages of this large project, I was greatly helped by a team of classicist readers whose eagle eyes saved me from innumerable infelicities. Thank you most especially to Alice Hu and Bill Beck, both extraordinarily quick, acute, and diligent readers of Homer and of me, who commented on the entire poem and introduction and helped me compile the glossary. Thank you to Jacob Feeley and Brian Rose for help with the maps, as well as the fine cartographer who drew them, Adrian Kitzinger. Deep thanks for alert, prompt, thoughtful reading and commenting on individual books and the introduction go to Addie Atkinks, Ginna Closs, Tom Elliott, Matthew Farmer, Julie Nishimura-Jensen, Hannah Rich, Ralph Rosen, Lydia Spielberg, Alison Traweek, Caroline Whitbeck, and Kate Wilson.

I have been lucky to have the help of Joanne Dubil, the ever-reliable administrator in my alternate home, the Program in Comparative Literature and Literary Theory, for providing a warm and secure environment in which to work. I am also grateful to my mother, Katherine Duncan-Jones, who read many early sections of the poem, and to my sister, Bee Wilson, for essential emotional support.

I would like to thank those who have tried to educate me over the years, especially Jasper Griffin, with whom I first read Homer in Greek, and the late-lamented Oliver Lyne and David Quint, both of whom, in different ways, taught me to look for the stories and voices of losers in epic. Looking further back, I would like to thank the women who taught me Greek at Oxford High School for Girls, including Deborah Bennett, Eda Forbes, and Caroline Mayr-Harting. I would also like to thank the teachers at St. Barnabas Primary School, Oxford (especially Mr. Penfield, aka The Cyclops), for inspiring my eight-year-old self with a lifelong interest in the [Odyssey]{.italic}.

Thanks to Trent Duffy for his excellent copyediting services, without which the line numbering and capitalization would have been hopelessly inconsistent. All remaining errors are, of course, my fault. Thank you also to Gerra Goff at Norton, who has helped keep everything on schedule.

Thank you to Holly Danesi, for the tattoo of Athena's owl that has helped me through the project.

Thank you to each of my three daughters, for letting me work sometimes, and for sharing my love of stories, pretend-play, magic, goddesses, adventures, and home. Thank you also to all the wonderful staff of St. Mary's Nursery School/Afterschool Program, without whom I could not have finished this book.

Finally, I am grateful to and for David Foreman. Thank you.
