# Loeb Classical Library Chamber Integration Plan

*Systematic documentation for three-phase integration of the complete Loeb Classical Library into the Chamber's source-aware capacity*

---

## Executive Summary

The Loeb Classical Library DSL contains **377 authors** and **1,932 works** across 537 volumes. This represents the most comprehensive scholarly collection of Greco-Roman classical texts with bilingual presentation (original Greek/Latin + English translations) and full critical apparatus.

**Source Location**: `/Users/davidglidden/Documents/Loeb Classical All Library 537 Volumes/`  
**Integration Goal**: Transform the Chamber from having classical excerpts to complete source-aware capacity across the entire classical tradition.
