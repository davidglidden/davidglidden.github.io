## [FOREWORD](#calibre_link-85){.toc-link} {#foreword .chapter-title}

::: ext
In his own foreword to *Morgoth's Ring* (vol. X of *The History of
Middle-earth*), Christopher Tolkien writes of his father that, at the
end of the 1950s, and following the publication of *The Lord of the
Rings*:
:::

Meditating long on the world that he had brought into being and was now
in part unveiled, he had become absorbed in analytic speculation
concerning its underlying postulates. Before he could prepare a new and
final *Silmarillion* he must satisfy the requirements of a coherent
theological and metaphysical system, rendered now more complex in its
presentation by the supposition of obscure and conflicting elements in
its roots and its tradition.

Among the chief "structural" conceptions of the mythology that he
pondered in those years were the myth of Light; the nature of Aman; the
immortality (and death) of the Elves; the mode of their reincarnation;
the Fall of Men and the length of their early history; the origin of the
Orcs; and above all, the power and significance of Melkor-Morgoth, which
was enlarged to become the ground and source of the corruption of Arda.

::: ext
Christopher published a sizeable selection of and from Tolkien's long
meditation on his sub-created world in *Morgoth's Ring* and the
subsequent two volumes of *The History of Middle-earth*, but by no means
all. The texts in this volume constitute a significant part and a fuller
record of his "analytic speculation concerning its underlying
postulates". They comprise the "writings about Middle-earth and Aman
that are of a primarily philosophic or speculative nature" that were not
included in the latter volumes of *The History of Middle-earth*; as well
as those of a descriptive and/or historical nature, chiefly concerning
the lands and peoples of Númenor and Middle-earth, that were not
included in *Unfinished Tales*. These texts and this book are very much
of a piece with significant portions of the aforementioned volumes, and
will be of greatest interest to those who take particular interest in
them.

Like *The Lord of the Rings*, this book has been long in the making. I
have in a sense been working on this book -- though for long I had no
awareness or notion that I was doing so -- for nearly 25 years. In 1997,
in my capacity as one of the authorized editors of his father's
linguistic papers, I received from Christopher Tolkien a bundle of
photocopies of various manuscript and typescript materials, which he
referred to collectively as "late philological essays". As this
designation rightly implies, all of the materials in this bundle are
concerned to some degree with linguistic matters; but as is often the
case in Tolkien's post-*Lord of the Rings* non-narrative writings, the
linguistic matters that occasioned each essay led Tolkien into long
(seeming) digressions, either because they explain the historical,
cultural, mythological and/or metaphysical situations that various words
and phrases reflect; or simply because Tolkien wished to pursue some
idea or point that occurred to him at that time. I edited and published
three essays from this bundle in the journal *Vinyar Tengwar* first,
"*Ósanwe-kenta*", a far-ranging essay on thought-communication, in *VT*
39 in July 1998; "Notes on *Órë*", a consideration of the inner warning
and advising faculty of Incarnates, in *VT* 41 in July 2000; and "The
Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor", a lengthy discussion of the names
and characteristics of those geographic features, in *VT* 42 in July
2001. (Christopher had in fact prepared an edition of the latter text
for inclusion in *The Peoples of Middle-earth*, but it was cut for lack
of space.) A fourth long essay from this bundle, supplemented with
related materials found in Tolkien's linguistic papers, was edited by
Patrick Wynne and published in three parts as "Eldarin Hands, Fingers,
and Numerals" in *VT* 46--49 from February 2005 to June 2007. (The first
three texts are published here as chapters IX and X of part two, and
chapter XXII of part three, respectively. The fourth, in considerably
reduced form, is published as chapter III of part two.)

Following the publication of my editions of "*Ósanwe-kenta*" and "The
Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor", and knowing of my great interest in
these and similar philosophical, historical, and descriptive writings by
Tolkien, even apart from their linguistic elements, Christopher asked me
to assist French scholar Michaël Devaux in preparing an edition of the
(mostly) unpublished materials concerning Elvish reincarnation that
Christopher alludes to in several places in both *Morgoth's Ring* and
*The Peoples of Middle-earth*, and which he had sent to Devaux. This
edition, together with Devaux's French translation and commentary, was
eventually published in the journal *La Feuille de la Compagnie* vol. 3
in 2014. (These writings, in my own edition, are published here as
chapter XV of part two and chapter XV of part three.)

This interest also explains why, beginning in the late summer of 2008,
Christopher began sending me successive batches of photocopies of a
large bundle of late (chiefly) manuscript writings, which had been
collected together under the title "Time and Ageing", for my
consideration and thoughts on their possible disposition. As will be
seen, many of these writings are quite unlike the vast bulk of Tolkien's
writings, featuring *inter alia* long tables and calculations regarding
the maturation rate and population growth of the Eldar from the time of
their awaking, to the time of the Great March, and through their arrival
in Beleriand and beyond. Despite this technical and undeniably dry
accounting, they nonetheless contain many interesting details of
historical and cultural significance -- e.g. the fact that Tolkien
considered having not only the Vala Oromë instruct and guard the Elves
at Cuiviénen, but also the Maia Melian, and those of her fellow Maiar
that would later, in incarnate form, come (again?) to Middle-earth in
the Third Age as the Istari, the Five Wizards that were sent by the
Valar to encourage resistance to Sauron. These materials as a whole also
exemplify not only Tolkien's unsuspected (at least by me) mathematical
skills and precision (in a time well before electronic calculators
became affordable), but also his great concern for coherence and
verisimilitude, as seen throughout his later writings.

After long study and pondering of the "Time and Ageing" materials, and
thinking of the writings in the "late philological essays" (both
published and unpublished), and further of certain likewise
philosophical and cultural passages (again both published and
unpublished) in Tolkien's linguistic papers, similarly arising from
etymological considerations -- e.g. the essay I had edited and published
as "Fate and Free Will" in *Tolkien Studies* 6 in 2009 (chapter XI of
part two), and a long discussion of the nature of spirits according to
Elvish thought that was edited and published by Christopher Gilson in
issue 17 of his journal *Parma Eldalamberon* in 2007 (see [chapter
XIII](#calibre_link-48) of part two) -- I began to discern how all this
material might be organized together into a coherent book. This would
allow me not only to publish such a substantial amount of material,
which could not be accommodated in a journal, but also to bring it all
to the wider audience I feel it deserves. Having come to this
conclusion, I quickly chose to call this projected book *The Nature of
Middle-earth*, as succinctly unifying these materials under the two main
senses of the word "nature": both the visible and sensible phenomena of
the physical world, including its lands, flora, and fauna; and the
metaphysical, innate, and essential qualities and character of the world
and its inhabitants.

This book is divided into three broad categorical parts. Part one, "Time
and Ageing", is almost entirely composed of materials from the
collection of the same name described above, though it is here and there
supplemented with material from Tolkien's linguistic papers. Part two,
"Body, Mind, and Spirit", and part three, "The World, Its Lands, and Its
Inhabitants", are composed of materials from three chief sources: a) the
bundle of "late philological essays" sent to me in 1997; b) material
drawn from Tolkien's linguistic papers; and c) particularly in part
three, material collected by me over the years from the two principal
archives of Tolkien manuscripts at the Bodleian in Oxford and at
Marquette University in Milwaukee. I have re-edited those materials that
have been previously published in specialist journals to make them more
accessible to a general audience, chiefly by removing or minimizing
passages and commentary that are principally concerned with linguistic
details. There is of course inevitably some overlap within particular
texts among these three broad categories, but the distribution of texts
among them, and the ordering of texts within each part, are what seem
most sensible to me.

It is a pleasure to gratefully acknowledge the assistance of many people
in the compilation and completion of this book. Catherine McIlwaine, the
Tolkien Archivist at the Bodleian Libraries in Oxford, and William
Fliss, Archivist of the Special Collections and University Archives at
the Raynor Memorial Libraries of Marquette University in Milwaukee, have
been extremely helpful and enthusiastic supporters of this book. I am
also extremely grateful to Cathleen Blackburn and all the Tolkien
Estate, and to Chris Smith, Tolkien editor for HarperCollins, for making
publication of this book possible. I am, like all Tolkien scholars and
researchers, indebted to Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull for their
exacting and exhaustive research and reference works, in particular the
indispensable three-volume *J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide*. I was
fortunate to be able to avail myself of John Garth's extensive knowledge
of Tolkien's military experience, and his thoughtful assistance in
locating certain texts in the Bodleian archives, in particular the
Númenórean material in this book. Arden Smith and Charles Noad have both
applied their formidable proofreading and fact-checking skills to the
text (though of course any errors that remain are due solely to me). I
am also grateful for the support, friendship, and encouragement of
numerous Tolkien scholars and friends from around the world who have
heard me read from some of the materials in this book over the years,
including: David Bratman, Marjorie Burns, Michelle Markey Butler, Janice
Coulter, Chip Crane, Jason Fisher, Matt Fisher, Verlyn Flieger,
Christopher Gilson, Melody Green, Peter Grybauskas, Wayne Hammond, Yoko
Hemmi, Gary Hunnewell, John Rateliff, Christina Scull, Eleanor Simpson,
Arden Smith, Valah Steffen-Wittwer, Paul Thomas, Patrick Wynne, and the
late, much-missed Vaughn Howland and Richard West.

Finally, my greatest gratitude is of course to Christopher Tolkien, who
directly supplied me with most of the materials that have gone into this
book and supported my idea to publish them in this manner. He was able
to see and approve my book proposal, with a representative selection of
my treatment and presentation of the texts, and my plan for the book as
a whole, in the year before his passing. I am above all thankful for the
kindness, encouragement, and sympathy he expressed to me in the course
of our decades-long correspondence. I had the great good fortune to
count him as a friend, and I dedicate this book to his memory.

## [EDITORIAL PRACTICES](#calibre_link-86){.toc-link} {#editorial-practices .chapter-title}

::: ext
In order to make these texts as readable as possible, with minimal
editorial intrusion, I have often silently: expanded abbreviations where
their meaning is in no doubt; supplied punctuation, conjunctions, and
other minor connecting words where Tolkien writing in greater haste has
omitted them; and regularized capitalization and other spelling
conventions, where such alterations are insignificant to the text or its
meaning. I have however tended not to regularize spelling or, save where
necessary for clarity, supplied punctuation or other additions to texts
cited in the editorial notes. I have also made no attempt to either note
or record where Tolkien has both made and subsequently corrected a
mathematical error.

With the exception of more or less brief introductions, describing the
manuscript or typescript of each text and providing a date (as nearly as
possible) and other relevant context, all editorial commentary --
chiefly detailing authorial and/or editorial alterations of any
significance, citing significant differences among variant versions of a
text, and cross-references to Tolkien's other writings -- has been
placed in numbered end-notes to each text (or group of related texts),
and need not be consulted by those not interested in such textual
matters. Where editorial comments must be made within Tolkien's own
texts, they are distinguished as such by being set in a smaller type and
indented from the textual margins.

Tolkien is inconsistent throughout in his use of single-quotes (inverted
commas) and double-quotes. I have adopted the practice of using
double-quotes for all quotations and phrases (except for quotes and
phrases within quotes, for which single-quotes are used), and
single-quotes for all glosses (actual or apparent): e.g. *fëa* 'spirit',
*hröa* 'body'.

Wherever practicable I have given Tolkien's own footnotes and
interpolated notes (frequent in his later writings) as footnotes on the
page of the note's referent. Where it is necessary to provide editorial
end-notes to these footnotes (which my text editor does not permit) I
place the end-note mark in square brackets next to the footnote mark:
e.g., and indicate in the end-note upon which word or passage or matter
in the footnote I am commenting.

I have supplied a brief discussion of various metaphysical and
theological concepts and themes encountered in these texts, as Appendix
I, linked to key points of relevance in the texts. A glossary and index
of forms from Tolkien's invented languages that are important to
clarifying the meaning of various not-specifically-linguistic passages
encountered in the texts in this book, and that can be used for further
topical cross-referencing, are included in the editorial Glossary and
Index of Quenya Terms as Appendix II.

Familiarity with at least *The Silmarillion* as published in 1977 is
assumed. Ready access to *Unfinished Tales* and volumes X--XII of *The
History of Middle-earth* will further aid in understanding the texts
included here.

::: ext
Among the large collection of (mostly) manuscript pages that Christopher
Tolkien dubbed the "Time and Ageing" file are two half-sheets of Merton
College stationery, on which two related but distinct texts -- presented
here as chap. I, "The Valian Year" -- were written some six years apart.
These two texts conveniently demonstrate that, sometime between 1951 and
1957, Tolkien made two decisions that would have far-reaching effects on
his *legendarium*. While the first of these decisions -- namely, to make
the Sun and Moon coëval with Arda, the inhabited world -- and its
ramifications in and for Tolkien's subsequent writings and revisions
have already been documented and considered by Christopher Tolkien in
the final three volumes of his monumental *History of Middle-earth* (and
particularly in the section titled "Myths Transformed" in volume X,
*Morgoth's Ring*), the second transformative decision and its
ramifications have not before been presented.

As the second of these two texts shows, Tolkien had by 1957 decided that
the number of sun-years (SY) in a Year of the Trees, or Valian Year
(VY), should be greatly increased, from the previous rate of 10 SY = 1
VY to a new rate of 144 SY = 1 VY, and thus vastly expanded the length
of time in sun-years of the events recorded in the Annals of Valinor and
subsequent chronologies dated in Valian Years. Much of the "Time and
Ageing" file, whose texts are presented here, is concerned with working
out the (perhaps surprisingly) complex ramifications of this decision,
not only for the chronology of the First Age -- in particular for the
Awakening of the Elves (including even just who were the First Elves to
awaken), the Great March, and the return of both Morgoth and the Exiles
to Middle-earth -- but also for the periods []{#calibre_link-1553
aria-label="4" role="doc-pagebreak"}of time occupied by the begetting,
growth, maturity, and ageing of Elves.

Tolkien's preoccupation with some of these matters in the late 1950s,
particularly Elvish begetting, maturation, and ageing relative to Men,
has already been glimpsed, in the opening of the c. 1958 text known as
*Laws and Customs among the Eldar* (X:209--10):
:::

The Eldar grew in bodily form slower than Men, but in mind more swiftly.
They learned to speak before they were one year old; and in the same
time they learned to walk and to dance, for their wills came soon to the
mastery of their bodies. Nonetheless there was less difference between
the two Kindreds, Elves and Men, in early youth; and a man who watched
elf-children at play might well have believed that they were the
children of Men, of some fair and happy people ...

This same watcher might indeed have wondered at the small limbs and
stature of these children, judging their age by their skill in words and
grace in motion. For at the end of the third year mortal children began
to outstrip the Elves, hastening on to a full stature while the Elves
lingered in the first spring of childhood. Children of Men might reach
their full height while Eldar of the same age were still in body like to
mortals of no more than seven years. Not until the fiftieth year did the
Eldar attain the stature and shape in which their lives would afterwards
endure, and for some a hundred years would pass before they were
full-grown.

The Eldar wedded for the most part in their youth and soon after their
fiftieth year. They had few children, but these were very dear to them.
Their families, or houses, were held together by love and a deep feeling
for kinship in mind and body; and the children needed little governing
or teaching. There were seldom more than four children in any house, and
the number grew less as ages passed; but even in days of old, while the
Eldar were still few and eager to increase their kind, Fëanor was
renowned as the father of seven sons, and the histories record none that
surpassed him.

::: ext
And further (X:212--13):
:::

As for the begetting and bearing of children: a year passes between the
begetting and the birth of an elf-child, so that the days of both are
the same or nearly so, and it is the day of begetting that is remembered
year by year. For the most part these days come in the Spring. It might
be thought that, since the Eldar do not (as Men deem) grow
[]{#calibre_link-1554 aria-label="5" role="doc-pagebreak"}old in body,
they may bring forth children at any time in the ages of their lives.
But this is not so. For the Eldar do indeed grow older, even if slowly:
the limit of their lives is the life of Arda, which though long beyond
the reckoning of Men is not endless, and ages also. Moreover their body
and spirit are not separated but coherent. As the weight of the years,
with all their changes of desire and thought, gathers upon the spirit of
the Eldar, so do the impulses and moods of their bodies change. This the
Eldar mean when they speak of their spirits consuming them; and they say
that ere Arda ends the Eldalië on earth will have become as spirits
invisible to mortal eyes, unless they will to be seen by some among Men
into whose minds they may enter directly.

Also the Eldar say that in the begetting, and still more in the bearing
of children, greater share and strength of their being, in mind and in
body, goes forth than in the making of mortal children. For these
reasons it came to pass that the Eldar brought forth few children; and
also that their time of generation was in their youth or earlier life,
unless strange and hard fates befell them. But at whatever age they
married, their children were born within a short space of years after
their wedding. (Short as the Eldar reckoned time. In mortal count there
was often a long interval between the wedding and the first child-birth,
and even longer between child and child.) For with regard to generation
the power and the will are not among the Eldar distinguishable.
Doubtless they would retain for many ages the power of generation, if
the will and desire were not satisfied; but with the exercise of the
power the desire soon ceases, and the mind turns to other things. The
union of love is indeed to them great delight and joy, and the 'days of
the children', as they call them, remain in their memory as the most
merry in life; but they have many other powers of body and mind which
their nature urges them to fulfil.

::: ext
It is evident that the bulk of the texts in the "Time and Ageing" file
are later than *Laws and Customs*, as shown by the use of the Quenya
word *hröa* for 'body' (nearly) everywhere in these texts, *ab initio*
-- while in *Laws and Customs* as first written/typed, the form was
*hrondo*, before subsequent correction to *hröa*. It will thus be seen
that the extensive "Time and Ageing" file is a series of elaborations
and reconsiderations of the matters of Elvish gestation, maturation, and
ageing raised in *Laws and Customs*, and related matters, in light of
the great increase in time spanned by the tally of Valian Years.

On the subject of dating the individual "Time and Ageing" texts, most of
which are clearly of a piece, in order to reduce repetition in
[]{#calibre_link-1555 aria-label="6" role="doc-pagebreak"}justifying a
probable date for most of them, if I simply flatly state that a text is
"c. 1959" without further evidence, then the date is based on one or
more of the following considerations:
:::

::: ext
1\. The text uses the Quenya word *hröa* (plural *hröar*), meaning
'body' *ab initio*. There is no independent evidence that that word was
in use until after the typescript text B of *Laws and Customs among the
Eldar* was made in c. 1958 (see X:141--3, 209, 304).

2\. The text employs the name *Ingar* for the people of Ingwë, which
otherwise occurs only in Text A of *Laws and Customs* *among the Eldar*
(cf. X:230 n.22) and in Text 2 of *Of Finwë and Míriel* (cf. X:265
n.10), both of which belong to what Christopher Tolkien identifies as
the "second phase" in the development of *The Later Quenta
Silmarillion*, which he in turn dates to "the late 1950s" (cf. X:199,
300).

3\. The manuscript in appearance and the text in character and content
is consistent with most of the other writings in the "Time and Ageing"
file, including those that can be dated more certainly to c. 1959 by
other internal or external evidence.
:::

::: ext
The texts presented here for the most part fall into one of three
stages, based on an apparent conceptional progression in the period of
Elvish gestation in the womb: the first, in which Elves gestate for 8 or
(more usually) 9 *löar* (as the solar year is called in Quenya); the
second, in which they gestate for 1 *löa*; and the third and last, in
which they gestate for 3 *löar*. The first two of these stages are
exhibited in texts that either firmly or most likely date from c. 1959
or 1960; the third is found in a single document that dates from 1965.

Finally, while I provide a glossary of terms in App. II, there are
certain Quenya words that occur in "Time and Ageing" so frequently that
I gloss them here as well for ease of reference for the reader:
:::

::: ext
*hröa*, pl. *hröar* 'body'.

*fëa*, pl. f*ëar* 'spirit'

*löa*, pl. *löar* 'year (of the Sun)', lit. 'growth'.

*yên*, pl *yéni* 'long-year' = 144 *löar*.

## [THE VALIAN YEAR](#calibre_link-90){.toc-link} {#the-valian-year .chapter-title1}

::: ext
These two brief texts are written in black nib-pen on two torn
half-sheets of two (different) Merton College weekly battels bills.
Tolkien was the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature from
1945 until his retirement in 1959. The portion of the bill bearing the
first text does not have the date field, but that bearing the second
text does, and is dated 27 June 1957.

The first (very hastily written) text shows that when he wrote it,
Tolkien had decided that the world must be round and coëval with the Sun
and Moon, and so it must post-date the "Round World" version (C\*) of
the *Ainulindalë* that Tolkien made in 1948 (X:3). It most likely
precedes, however, the revisions to the c. 1951 version of the *Annals
of Aman* by which the length of a Valian Year was reduced from exactly
10 sun-years (as in the first text) to 9.582 sun-years (X:50, and see
X:57--8 n.17 and 59--60 §§5--10).
:::

T[EXT]{.small1} 1

The *yên*, which is merely a mode of reckoning, has nothing to do with
the life of the Elves. In Aman this depended on the years of the Trees,
or really on the *days* of the Trees; in Middle-earth on the cycles of
growth, Spring to Spring, or *löar*. In Middle-earth, one *löa* aged an
Elf as much as a year of the Trees, but these were in fact 10 times as
long.

A Year of the Trees had 1,000 days of 12 hours = 12,000 \[Tree\] hours.
A year of 365.250 days of 24 hours has 8,766 hours.
[]{#calibre_link-1557 aria-label="8" role="doc-pagebreak"}Tree-years
have 87,660. If 12,000 \[Tree\] hours = 10 Middle-earth years each
Tree-hour = about 7.3 Sun-hours = 7 hours 18 secs.[^1]

*How* are we to arrange for the *Sun* and *Moon*?

Elves do not know how Arda was established or the companions of *Anar*
made or their \[?companies\]. For it is to the life of *Arda* (*not* Eä)
which they are bound, and all their *love* is for Arda. Though \[?of
Lore\] they may consider \[?the matter\] and having amazing sight they
can see in the heavens things we cannot \[?for need of\] instruments.

T[EXT]{.small1} 2

::: ext
*Time*
:::

There are twelve Tree-hours in each Valian Day, 144 Days in each Valian
Year. But each Valian Year = 144 Mortal Years; therefore 1 Valian Day =
1 mortal year, and 1 Tree-hour = approximately 1 mortal month. Time is
recorded (for Mortal purposes) during the days of the Trees thus: VY 100
V.Day 136 V.Hour 9 = the 9^th^ month of the 136^th^ \[sun-\]year of the
100^th^ Valian Year.[^2]

In Middle-earth originally the Quendi appreciated and aged in 144 MY (or
*yên*) as \[mortals\] in 1 MY. Therefore when they went to Aman they
felt no change -- but those who remained soon felt the necessary rate of
"mortality" in ageing. After the death of the Trees and the ruin of
Beleriand the rate was about 12 years = 1 MY.

The Elves awoke in VY 1050 and reached Aman in 1133 after 83 VY, which
felt as 83 years to them but was 11,952 MY. Men awoke in VY 1150 or 100
VY later = 14,400 MY.[^3]

::: ext
It can be seen then that by c. 1957 Tolkien had introduced a new
correspondence of 1 Valian Year = 144 sun-years (the length of the
Elvish *yên* or 'long year'), and so vastly expanded the length of time
in sun-years of the events recorded in the *Annals of Valinor* and
subsequent chronologies dated in Valian Years.

## [VALINORIAN TIME-DIVISIONS](#calibre_link-94){.toc-link} {#valinorian-time-divisions .chapter-title1}

::: ext
This text occupies eight sides of four sheets of unlined paper. It is
written in a clear hand in black nib-pen, with additions and some
revisions made in blue ball-point pen. The versos of most sheets are
filled with attendant calculations, not represented here. It dates to c.
1959.
:::

In a revised scheme -- in which the Sun and Moon are a primeval part of
Arda, established before Arda was inhabitable -- the *basic time*, even
in Aman, must be the *Sun-year*, since this governs all growth, be it
slow, normal, or quick. But the sun-day need not be observed, since
Valinor was domed over.[^4]

Hence the *basic equivalent* of Valian Time and Middle-earth Time (VT
and MT) will be:

1 Valian Day (or Tree-day) = 1 Sun-year

All multiplications or divisions of this were by 12. Hence the Valian
Month had 12 Valian Days = 12 years, the Valian Year (a *yén*) had 12
Valian Months = 144 years.

These equivalences are exact; since the Valian Day was maintained always
at the length of the Elvish *löa* or Sun-year (whether that varied or
lengthened or not).[^5]

[]{#calibre_link-1559 aria-label="10" role="doc-pagebreak"}*In the Days
of the Trees*: The Valian Day was divided into 12 Valian Hours, which
were arranged evidently to occupy exactly 1⁄12 each of whatever was the
length of the Sun-year. (This is held to have varied and to have
lengthened.) At present Sun-year length a Valian Hour is therefore
approximately 1 month of 30 (or nearly 30½) days.[^6]

Since the Valar and Eldar only grow or age slowly, but do not live, act,
go, or perceive slowly (on the contrary) for local use in Aman the
Valian Hour was further subdivided in repetitive 12s.

A Solar Year contains 365d. 5h. 48m. 46s. = 365d. 20,926 secs. or
365.242199074 days.

1 day has 86,400 secs. ¼ day therefore has 21,600 secs. The Year is thus
674 secs. (11m. 14secs) short of 365¼ days.

:::

Or very nearly. At true value this would be 35,831,807.9581 ... minims
in a year.

::: ext
Tolkien then wrote "actual value" and calculated the fractional part of
the relation of a minim to solar seconds to approximately 360 decimal
places, noting where values started to repeat. On the next page he adds
a sext before the minim, thus shortening the minim by a further 12^th^.
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1560 aria-label="11" role="doc-pagebreak"}1 Valian Day
exactly equalled 1 *löa* or Sun-year. This was divided into 12 Hours of
the Trees. Each of these therefore equalled 1⁄12 Year. All subsequent
subdivisions of the Valian Hour were also by 12, and ran from Prime
through Second, Terce, Quart, Quint, Sext (or first, second, etc.
subdivision of the Hour) to the Minim, which was 1⁄12^7^ part of the
Valian Hour and approximately 1/14 of our seconds.

At the present rate of 365 days 5 hrs. 48 mins. 46 secs. to 1 year:

While I have not felt obliged to retain the precise order of texts as
found in the "Time and Ageing" file, I have done so for the first five
texts that follow, because Tolkien appears to have selected, relabelled,
and (in the case of the first three) assigned them Roman numerals, in
such a way as to indicate a plan to assemble a larger work from them, to
be titled "Of Time in Arda".

In the case of the first text, originally called "Time-scales", Tolkien
assigned it a number and a new title:
:::

I. The *Quendi* compared with Men

::: ext
The second text, originally called "Youth of the Quendi", was likewise
assigned a number and a new title:
:::

III\. Natural Youth and Growth of the Quendi

::: ext
(If there ever was a text II, it appears no longer to reside in the
"Time and Ageing" folder.) The third text was simply assigned a number,
otherwise retaining its original title:
:::

IV\. Summary of the Eldarin traditions concerning the "Awakening" and of
the *Legend of the* *Cuivië* (*Cuivienyarna*)

::: ext
Additionally, all the sides of these texts (that had not previously been
struck through) were then renumbered continuously from 1--15.

[]{#calibre_link-1562 aria-label="13" role="doc-pagebreak"}All these
modifications were made in red ball-point pen, which may be significant
to the titles supplied in the top margins of the sides of the subsequent
two texts, likewise in red ball-point pen (though they were not assigned
a number nor were their sides renumbered continuously with the first
three texts). Thus:
:::

Awaking of the Quendi

::: ext
was written in the top margins of the sides of both versions of the
fourth text, and:
:::

March

was written in the top margins of the sides of both versions of the
fifth text, which originally had the title of just "*Quendi*".

Apparently subsequent to the selection and modifications of the first
three texts, Tolkien began a new typescript version of the assembled
texts (though in the event only getting part-way through the newly
renamed first text), which thus now serves as a sort of cover sheet for
them. This typescript occupies two sheets, with the text ending at the
bottom of the second sheet. All Elvish terms are typed with a red
ribbon, as is the extensive footnote on Quenya terms for "love". As far
as it goes, this typescript closely follows the manuscript version,
presented here as chap. IV, "Time-scales", below, but with enough
differences in detail that I give it here in full.

OF TIME IN ARDA

I

The Quendi compared with Men

The Valar having entered Arda, and being therefore confined within its
life, must also suffer its slow ageing, perceiving it as a growing
weight upon them, since they are to the total *erma* of Arda in many
ways similar to the *fëar* within the corporeal *hröar* of the Incarnate
(*hröambari*).[^7]

The Quendi, being immortal within Arda, also aged with Arda as regards
their *hröar*; but since, unlike the Valar whose true life was not
corporeal and who assumed bodily forms at their own will as raiment, the
being of the Quendi was incarnate, and consisted naturally
[]{#calibre_link-1563 aria-label="14" role="doc-pagebreak"}of the union
of a *fëa* and a *hröa*, this ageing was felt chiefly in the *hröa*.

This, as the Eldar say, was slowly "consumed" by the *fëa*, until
instead of dying and being discarded to dissolution it became absorbed,
and eventually became no more than the memory of its habitation of old
which the *fëa* retained; thus they have become now usually invisible to
human eyes. But this has taken long ages to come about. In the beginning
the *hröar* of the Elves, being supported and nourished by the great
strength of their *fëar*, were vigorous, resisting hurts, and healing
such as they suffered swiftly from within. Their ageing was therefore
extremely slow by the measure of Men, though they were in their earlier
days as "physical" as Men, or even more so: more strong, energetic, and
swift in body, and taking greater delight in all bodily pleasures and
exercises.

If we disregard the *actual time*, measured in the sun-years of
Middle-earth, but use "years" merely as units of measurement in the
growth from birth to maturity proper to each kind, it will be observed
that the Elves closely resembled Men in this process. They reached
maturity (of the body) at about the age of 20, and remained in full
physical vigour till about the age of 60. After that the *fëa* and its
interests began to dominate them. At the age of about 100 one of the
Quendi had reached a stage similar to that of a Mortal of full age and
wisdom. The normal period, therefore, for marriage and the begetting and
bearing of children and their nurture (which were among the greatest
delights of the Quendi in Arda) was between about the ages of 20 and 60.

The Quendi differed, however, from Men in several important aspects, if
we speak only of them in the early ages of their life in Arda.

1\. Their *fëar* never reached maturity in the sense that they ceased to
be able to grow, by further increase of knowledge and wisdom; but they
did reach a stage when *memory* (of thought and labour, and of the
events of history, general and to each one particular) began to be a
burden, or at least began more and more to occupy their minds and
emotions. This development, however, which marks the true "ageing" of
the Elves, did not concern the Elder Days, and first became evident
during the Second Age, increasing rapidly during the Third Age when the
Dominion of Men was finally achieved.

2\. Individuals were more variable even than among Men. This may be
ascribed to the variability of the Elvish *fëar* in native force and
talents (greater than any variation seen among Men), and the more
powerful influence which these *fëar* exerted upon their bodies. The
[]{#calibre_link-1564 aria-label="15" role="doc-pagebreak"}ages,
therefore, defined above: 20, 60, 100: are only general and approximate.
After maturity their minds and wills had far more control than is the
case with Men over the events of the body, and over the direction and
serial ordering of the uses of the body's powers. For instance, at
maturity one of the Quendi could marry and at once enter into the
*Onnarië* or 'Time of the Children'. But they could postpone marriage;
or within marriage postpone the *Onnarië* (by absence or abstinence):
either because they were otherwise occupied in pursuits that absorbed
their attention; or because they had not yet found one whom they wished
to marry, or as Men say "fallen in love";[^8][^9] or for reasons of
prudence or necessity, as in times of trouble, wandering, or exile.

Postponement of the fulfilment of marriage affected the time in which
the *hröa* remained in full vigour; for the use of these bodily powers
absorbed, relatively to Men, more of the vitality of the Quendi, and
more also (though in less degree) of the youth of the *fëa*. So that in
certain cases marriage might take place between Quendi of the age of 60
or even more years.[]{#calibre_link-1565 aria-label="16"

*Time-scales*
:::

The Valar having entered Arda, and being therein confined within its
life, must also suffer (while therein and being as it were its spirit,
as the *fëa* is to the *hröa* of the Incarnate) its slow ageing.[^10]
The Quendi being immortal within Arda also aged with Arda as regards
their *hröar*; but since, unlike the Valar, whose true life was not
corporeal and who assumed bodily forms at will as raiment, their being
was incarnate and consisted naturally of the union of a *fëa* and a
*hröa*, this ageing was felt chiefly in the *hröa*.[^11] This, as the
Eldar say, was slowly "consumed" by the *fëa*, until instead of dying
and being discarded to dissolution it became absorbed and eventually
became no more than the memory of its habitation of old which the *fëa*
retained: thus they became or have now become mostly invisible to human
eyes.[^12] But this has taken long ages to come about. In the beginning
the *hröar* of the Elves, being supported and nourished by the great
strength of their *fëar*, were vigorous, resisting hurts, and healing
such as they suffered swiftly from within. Their ageing was, therefore,
[]{#calibre_link-1567 aria-label="18" role="doc-pagebreak"}*extremely
slow* by mortal standards, though they were in their early days as
"physical" as Men, or even more so, more strong, vigorous, and swift in
body, and taking greater delight in all bodily pleasures and exercises.

If we disregard the actual time, measured in the sun-years of
Middle-earth, but use "years" merely as the units of measurement in the
growth from birth to maturity proper to each kind, it will be observed
that the Quendi resembled the Atani in this process. Their *fëar* never
reached maturity in the sense of ceasing to be capable of further
increase of knowledge and wisdom; but they did reach a stage when
memory, both of thought and labour (as well as of the events of history,
general and to each one particular), began to be a burden, or began more
and more to occupy their thought and emotion. But this development,
which marks the "ageing" of the Quendi, did not concern the Elder Days,
and first became evident during the Second Age, increasing rapidly
during the Third Age when the Dominion of Men was finally achieved.

The *hröar* of the Quendi had, however, a definite rhythm and process
similar to that of Men. They reached maturity at about the age of
20,[^13] and remained in full physical vigour till about the age of 60,
after which the *fëa* and its interests began to assume command. After
about the age of 90--96 one of the Quendi had reached a stage similar to
that of a vigorous and hale Mortal of high age and wisdom.[^14] The
normal period, therefore, for marriage and the begetting and bearing of
children and their nurture (which were one of the greatest delights of
the Quendi in Arda), was between about the ages of 20 and 60.

The Quendi differed, however, from Men in the following important
aspects, if we speak only of them in the earlier ages of their life in
Arda. Individuals were more variable, so that the ages defined above (of
20, 60, 90) are only general and approximate.[^15] After maturity (at
about 20) their minds and wills had far more control over the events of
the body and over the direction of the uses, and the serial ordering of
the uses, of the body's powers and functions. For instance, after
maturity one of the Quendi could marry and at once enter into the "Time
of the Children". But they could postpone marriage; or within marriage
postpone the "Time of the Children". Either because they were otherwise
occupied in pursuits that absorbed them; or because they had not found a
"desired spouse" (or as Men say "fallen in []{#calibre_link-1568
aria-label="19" role="doc-pagebreak"}love");[^16][^17] or for reasons of
prudence or necessity imposed by circumstances, as in times of trouble,
wandering, and exile.

Postponement of the fulfilment of marriage affected the length of time
in which the *hröa* remained in full vigour of maturity. For the
[]{#calibre_link-1569 aria-label="20" role="doc-pagebreak"}use of these
bodily powers absorbed, relatively to Men, more of the corporeal vigour
of the Quendi, and more also (though in less degree) of the "youth" of
the *fëa*.[^18] So that in certain cases marriage might take place
between Quendi of the age of 60 or even (rarely) of greater age.

It may also be noted that in each Elvish life there was normally only
one period of begetting or bearing children, whenever begun; and that
the length of this period was variable, as were the number of children
produced. It might occupy from 12 to about 60 years (occasionally
more).[^19] The children numbered usually 2, 3, or 4. One was
exceptional, and could be due to different causes: for instance, the
separation of the spouses, as in the case of Idril, daughter and sole
child of Turgon of Gondolin whose wife Anairë of the Vanyar would not go
with the Ñoldor into exile, but remained with Indis (also of the Vanyar)
widow of Finwë.[^20] In other cases the spouses (one or both) might not
desire more than one child. This was rare, and in the histories of the
Elder Days occurred only when some child of exceedingly great qualities
was born which (as the Eldar say) demanded far more of the vigour and
life of the parents than a normal child. The most eminent case was that
of Míriel mother of the most gifted of all the Ñoldor, Feänor. Another
case was that of Lúthien, daughter of Elwë and Melyanna (Elu Thingol and
Melian);[^21] though this case was also unique in that Melyanna was not
an Elf but of the race of the Valar, a Maia.[^22][^23]

A greater number than *four* was rare, though in the early days of the
full vigour of the Eldar *five* or *six* children are recorded to have
been born to one pair of spouses.[^24] *Seven* was wholly exceptional,
and indeed among the High-elves only the case of Feänor is recorded. He
[]{#calibre_link-1570 aria-label="21" role="doc-pagebreak"}had *seven*
sons. The last two were twins: Amrod and Amras. Twins were very rare,
and this is the only case recorded of the Eldar in the ancient
histories, except for the twin sons, Eldún and Elrún, of Dior Eluchil,
but he was half-elven. In later times (Third Age) Elrond had twin
sons.[^25]

It must be remembered, however, in considering the records and legends
of the past, that these (especially those made by or handed down through
Men) often only mention or name persons who play a recorded part in the
events, or were the direct ancestors of such chief actors. It cannot
therefore be concluded from silence alone, whether in narrative or in
genealogy, that any given person had no children, or no more than are
named.

An elven-child was borne in its mother's womb for about the same
(relative) time as a mortal child, that is for about ¾ of a "youth-year"
= ¾ of 12 *löar* = 9 *löar*;[^26] though in the Quendi this period was
more variable, often being less, and on rare occasions being more.[^27]
It is said that Feänor remained in the womb for one growth-year (12
*löar*).[^28]

The *onnalúmë*, or 'Time of the Children', was in normal lives a
continuous series, occupying some 12 to 60 years.[^29] The interval
between the birth of a child and the next birth was usually one
"growth-year" = 12 *löar*; but was often more, and in a continuous
series tended to become longer (more rest being needed) between each
birth. Thus 12 *löar* before the 2^nd^ birth, 24 before the 3^rd^, 36
before the 4^th^, 42 before the 5^th^, and 48 before the 6^th^. But the
intervals could be *longer* and not necessarily in exact twelves.[^30]

But in comparing Quendi with Men it must be observed that the *unit*
(called a "year") was of quite different actual length in the case of
the Quendi. Similar differences occur in comparing other "kinds" of
growing creatures, or even other varieties of similar kinds. (Thus
animals "age" at different rates measured by Years of Middle-earth -- MY
or sun-years -- and so do different varieties of Men; so did even
different varieties of the Quendi: the Eldar grew to maturity less
quickly than did the Avari.)[^31]

In their beginning the Quendi grew at a rate in which the "unit" was the
*yên* or Elven-year, which was 144 MY. If then an elf-child grew to a
maiden and a young woman in about 20 "years", wedded at 25 and bore her
first child at 26, her age in mortal terms would be 2,880 at maturity,
3,600 at wedding, and 3,744 at childbirth.

[]{#calibre_link-851 aria-label="22" role="doc-pagebreak"}This speed of
growth and rate of ageing had nothing to do with the *perception of
time*. As the Eldar say of themselves (and this may in some degree also
be true of Men) when persons (in whole being *fëa* and *hröa*) are fully
occupied with things of deep natural concern and of delight to them, and
are in great bliss and health, Time seems to *pass quickly* and not the
reverse. The minute enjoyment and appreciation of events and thoughts in
the time-series does not, as might be supposed, make Time seem longer,
as might a road or path that was minutely inspected. For that inspection
could only be carried out by slowing the rate of normal travel. But the
rate of normal progress through Time cannot be slowed; but the speed of
thought and action can be quickened so as to achieve more in a given
space of time.[^32]

Thus the Quendi did not and do not "live slowly", moving ponderously
like tortoises, while Time flickers past them and their sluggish
thoughts! Indeed, they move and think swifter than Men, and achieve more
than a Man in any given length of time.[^33] But they have a far greater
native vitality and energy to draw upon, so that it takes and will take
a very great length of time to expend it.

Thus we may observe that all matters of *growth and development*, which
belong to the separate nature of the *hröa*, engaged in its own process
of achieving its complete and mature form, and which are not under the
will or conscious control of the *fëa*, proceed far slower among the
Quendi than among Men. Gestation, therefore, proceeds according to the
growth and ageing scale of the Quendi, and occupies ¾ *yên*, or 108
MY.[^34]

During all this time the parents are aware of the growth of the unborn
child, and live in much longer and more deeply-felt joy and expectation;
for childbirth is not among the Eldar accompanied by pain.[^35] It is
nonetheless not an easy or light matter, for it is achieved by a much
greater expense of the vigour of *hröa* and *fëa* (of "youth" as the
Eldar say) than is usual among Men; and is followed after the begetting
by a time of quiescence and withdrawal.[^36] The Elf-women also are
usually quiescent and withdrawn before and after birth. For these
reasons, the Eldar did not (if they could avoid it) enter into the "Time
of the Children" in times of trouble, or wandering. There were thus no
marriages or births during the Great March; nor again
[]{#calibre_link-1571 aria-label="23" role="doc-pagebreak"}during the
journey of the Ñoldor from Aman to Beleriand, and births were few during
all the War against Morgoth. For the same cause, Men who had dealings
with the Eldar often saw far less of the Elf-women, and might even be
unaware that some Elven-king or lord had a wife. For the withdrawal and
quiescence of the wife might occupy the whole time of his sojourn among
the Eldar, or indeed much of his whole mortal life-time. For this
"withdrawal", occupying from three to four "months" or twelfths of a
"year", that is one quarter to one third of a *yên*, would in mortal
terms endure for about 36 to 48 years.[^37]

On the other hand the act of procreation, being of a will and desire
shared and indeed controlled by the *fëa*, was achieved at the speed of
other conscious and willful acts of delight or of making. It was one of
the acts of chief delight, in process and in memory, in an Elvish life,
but its intensity alone provided its importance, not its time or length:
it could not have been endured for a great length of time, without
disastrous "expense".[^38]

*Youth of the Quendi*
:::

When the Quendi were very "young in Arda" (approximately their first
*six* generations in the first 96 Valian years of their existence) they
were far more like Men (unfallen).[^39] Their *hröar* were in great
vigour, and dominant; and the delights of the body of all kinds were
their chief concern. Their *fëar* were only beginning to wake fully and
to grow and discover their powers and interests. Thus (as was indeed at
first necessary, and so ordained for them) they were far more concerned
with love and the begetting of children than was so later.[^40]

It was not, however, their natural span of growth and life that was
different (at least not until many ages had passed); but they used it
differently. The natural life of the Quendi was to grow rapidly (for
them) to puberty, and then to endure in full vigour for a great length
[]{#calibre_link-1576 aria-label="28" role="doc-pagebreak"}of years,
until the interests of their *fëar* became pre-eminent, and their
*hröar* began to wane.

The "ages" of Quendi are usually given in terms equated with human life;
but not all lengths of years had the same ageing effect upon the Quendi.
The Eldar distinguished between *growth* and *life* (or
*life-endurance*). The former was 12 times as rapid (in ageing effect)
as the latter.

Now as for *growth*: this affected the Elvish *hröa* from *conception*
until *maturity* (or *puberty*). The *life-endurance* rate of the Quendi
was as 1 *yên* is to 1 *löa* or "sun-year": that is, 144 : Human 1. The
*growth-rate* was 12 times as rapid: i.e., was only in proportion 12
*löar* = 1 \[Human\] *löa* or sun-year. Thus from *conception to birth*
they lay in the womb 9 *löar*. *When born* they continued to *grow* at
the same rate, until puberty. With Elf-males this was reached at "age"
24; but with Elf-females at age 18.[^41][^42] That is for males 24 × 12
after birth, or 288 *löar*; for females 18 × 12 or 216 *löar*. In early
ages this "coming of Age" was a matter of ceremony, at which an Elf's
*essekilmë* or personal 'chosen-name' was announced.[^43]

But except in the *first three generations* the begetting of children by
*Elf-men* did not usually follow immediately on attaining "age 24"
(though "betrothal" often did, or even "marriage"). It was by degrees
postponed, until soon "age 48" became regarded as the optimum age for
the beginning of fatherhood, though it was often delayed until 60 (sc.
24 years of growth + 36 life-years).[^44] Of course, begetting of
further children could happen later than this. It *could* occur up to
about a male age of 96 -- later than this age (96) a *first*-begetting
seldom occurred.[^45]

In the case of *Elf-women*: marriage and child-bearing took place
earlier, their first child being born before they were of age
20.[^46][^47] Later indeed some postponement was usual so that marriage
at 21 was the most usual time; though any age up to 36 (18 + 18) was not
uncommon.[^48] In days of trouble, or of travel and unsettled life, the
begetting of children was naturally avoided or postponed; and *since the
postponement especially of the first child-bearing or begetting*
prolonged the "youth" or physical vigour of the Quendi, this might occur
up to a female age of about 72 (18 + 54) -- but a *first child-bearing*
seldom occurred after this age (72).[^49]

These dates in early ages at any rate (with which we are concerned)
[]{#calibre_link-1577 aria-label="29" role="doc-pagebreak"}were not so
much matters of physical impossibility *as of will or desire*. As soon
as they were full-grown, and with increasing rapidity after age 48
(Elf-men) and 36 (Elf-women), the *fëa* and its interests began to gain
the upper hand. An Elf who had not become married, or at least found one
desired as spouse,[^50] by these dates was likely (in normal
circumstances) to remain single -- though, naturally, in troublous
times, when lovers or spouses might be long separated, marriage might
well occur much later; or childbearing be long postponed.

The *number* of children produced by a married pair was naturally partly
affected by the character of the persons concerned (mental and
physical); and partly by various accidents of life. But it was also much
affected by the age at which marriage began. Even in the earliest times,
after the "First Elves", more than *six* children was very rare, and
four soon became the normal average. But six was never attained by those
marrying after 48/36. In later marriages two was more usual.

For chronological purposes and comparison of Elves and Men these dates
may be exhibited so:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------
  **\[Elf-years\]**                                                                                                           **\[Mortal-years\]**
  An Elf-child conceived was born 9 *löar* later. Elvish "growth" age about 9 months. Actual time:                            9 years
  The "growth age" of 12:1 (in comparison with mortal years) was maintained until an Elf-man reached "age 24". Actual time:   288 years
  In case of women it usually ceased at 18 though it was sometimes continued, especially in Aman, to 21. Actual time:         216 years (or 252)
  At "age 48" therefore, an Elf-man was 288 *löar* + 24 *yên* (288 + 3456).[^51]                                              3,744 years
  At "age 96" therefore, an Elf-man was 288 *löar* + 72 *yên*                                                                 10,656
  At "age 192" therefore, an Elf-man was 288 *löar* + 168 *yên*                                                               24,480
  At "age 21" therefore, an Elf-woman was 216 *löar* + 3 *yên* (216 + 432)                                                    648
  At "age 36" therefore, an Elf-woman was 216 *löar* + 18 *yên*                                                               2,808
  At "age 72" therefore, an Elf-woman was 216 *löar* + 54 *yên*                                                               7,992
  At "age 144" therefore, an Elf-woman was 216 *löar* + 126 *yên*                                                             18,360
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------

[]{#calibre_link-1578 aria-label="30" role="doc-pagebreak"}At all times,
unless circumstances interfered and separation were forced upon spouses
by wars or exile, the Quendi desired to dwell in company with husband or
wife during the bearing of a child and its early growth. Also as a rule,
they preferred to arrange their lives so as to have a consecutive "Time
of the Children" in which all of their children were born -- but this of
course often, especially in the troubled early years, proved
impossible.[^52] After a birth, even if a consecutive *Onnalúmë* or
'Time of Children' was achieved, a rest was naturally always taken. This
was governed by "growth-time", and so was usually not less than 12
*löar* (= 1 growth-year); but it might be much more; and usually was
increased progressively between each birth for consecutive series: as 12
: 24 : 36 : 48 etc.[]{#calibre_link-1579 aria-label="31"

::: ext
This text, a discussion of the issues presented by the chronology of the
awaking of the Quendi with respect to "The Silmarillion" as it then
stood, is extant in two versions. The first version, which bears the
title "*The Awaking of the Quendi* & position of Ingwë/Finwë/Elwë etc.",
dates (according to an explicit statement in it) from 1960, and occupies
the four sides of two sheets which Tolkien has lettered α--δ. The second
version, which appears to be closely contemporary, is a considerable
expansion of the first. It occupies six sides of three sheets numbered
by Tolkien 1--6. Both texts are written in black nib-pen and (for the
most part) more-or-less clearly; and the numberings of both texts,
various later notes, and the main title and two section titles of the
second version, were added in red ball-point pen. I give here first the
second version (B), followed by the significantly variant portions of
the first version (A).
:::

T[EXT]{.small1} B

::: ext
I. Preliminary discussion
:::

At this point: the Story has not been thought out, and the chronology,
so far devised, is impossible.

The "Tale of Years" (TY) makes the Quendi awake in VY 1050; but in VY
1085 Oromë finds already a considerable people.[^53] Now TY was devised
with a scale VY = (about) 10 Sun-years (*löar*).[^54] So it is plain
that the Quendi must have been created from the first in large numbers
(since only 350 *löar* have passed).

[]{#calibre_link-1581 aria-label="33" role="doc-pagebreak"}Also, since
Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë were first brought to Valinor in VY 1102, at that
time only 520 *löar* had elapsed since the Awaking.[^55] No scale of
Quendian "growth" or "ageing" is devised, but in Valinor events seem to
show that they lived at about the rate of 1 VY = 1 year of Elvish life.
This fits events in Valinor, for which it was arranged, but makes all
the Eldar far too old in later narrative, unless we suppose that they
remained unchanged, after maturity, for an indefinite time.

The *actual dates* of the TY need not be regarded, since (being on the
wrong scale) they will have to be revised. But, since a mass-creation of
the Quendi is poor narrative and mythology, some sort of "legend" of the
arising of the Elves and of their increase and fortunes must be devised,
and evidently a much longer time than 350 *löar* must elapse between the
"Awaking" and the "Finding", and much longer also than 480 *löar* (VY
1085 to VY 1133) between the "Finding" and the arrival of the Ñoldor in
Valinor.[^56] The whole matter of the "Great March" must be considered.

*But*: increasing the length of time between the "Awaking" and the
"Finding" (which is useful in allowing more time for Melkor to interfere
with them) must inevitably lay some blame on the Valar. As is probably
just.[^57]

The Valar had, of course, no *precise* knowledge of the time of that
"Awaking". Not if -- *as seems essential* -- the Vision (subsequent to
the Music) stopped short of the actual "Coming of the Children".[^58]
The Ainur were vouchsafed a Vision of the Children, but not of their
exact place in the sequence. Later Eru deliberately did *not* inform
Manwë of the approach of the time: for He did not intend them to be
dominated, and the function of the Valar was to prepare and govern the
*place* of their habitation. Even so the Valar should have kept better
watch, and not have allowed Melkor peace in which to establish himself.
They were, of course, very anxious, but neglected the matter until they
feared to ruin Arda in a war, which would involve the Children in misery
or destruction. (One may object that this could not be -- but *all* the
operations of Melkor, to those now in Time, appeared to be in defiance
of Eru, and to have power to upset or spoil the design; so that if these
were permitted by Eru (or could not be hindered!) there was no knowing
how far they would proceed.)

It seems clear that the *rescue of the Quendi* must be secret (as far as
possible), and *before the assault upon Utumno* -- otherwise this very
peril would have occurred. The *Great March* must occur behind a screen
of investment, and before any violent assault had begun!

[]{#calibre_link-839 aria-label="34" role="doc-pagebreak"}But Melkor
had, of course, since he largely controlled Middle-earth, and had hosts
of spies and servants, soon discovered the Quendi, and he had time to
frighten them, fill their minds with dark imaginings and fears, beside
(probably) capturing some of them, and even corrupting or seducing some
-- hence the taint in some degree of "the Shadow" which lay even upon
the Eldar.[^59]

*With regard to Men*: see under *Sauron*: *Arising and Fall of
Men*.[^60] The arising and fall took place during the "Captivity of
Melkor", and was achieved not by Melkor in person, but by Sauron. It
occurred about 100 VY after the "Awaking of the Quendi", sc. 14,400
*löar* later. In that case if Men arose in VY 1100, it would explain the
"neglect" of the Valar, since they had now done their duty and removed
Melkor. If the End of Valian reckoning with the Death of the Trees
occurred in VY 1495 (as in TY and so far assumed), by 310 in Beleriand
Men would have existed 395 VY + 310 *löar* = 57,190 years (*löar*).[^61]
Which is adequate (if not scientifically long enough).

The TY is here quite impossible. It makes Men first awake with the first
Rising of the Sun, which is VY 1500, after which dates are given in
*löar*.[^62] But the first Men appear in *Beleriand* -- already partly
civilized, deeply sundered in appearance and language, and leaving a
long history behind them -- and many other varieties of "unrepentant"
Men, in the East -- in SY 310. All that in 310 years![^63]

To take any date to begin with: Let Quendi awake in VY 1000. Then some
date *before* the Arising of Men would be best, but not very long (in
Elvish terms) before, for the Finding. At that time, though fairly
numerous (? some thousands), they had not spread far abroad --? fear of
Melkor, Sauron, &c.; and do not seem ever to have met Men (though they
had almost certainly heard lies about them from emissaries of Melkor).

The "Finding" should evidently be about VY 1090, or 90 VYs after the
"Awaking" (12,960 *löar*): this would give them time, even at Elvish
rates, for multiplication from small beginnings. *Also, which is
important,* time to invent the beginnings of the *Primitive Quendian
language*: to discover something about Arda, and of their own powers and
talents.[^64] (*Language* we must suppose was a specifically Elvish
gift, not possessed by the Valar even until they found the Quendi; a
gift of Eru inherent in their nature, so that from their Awaking they
immediately began to try to communicate *in speech* with one
another.[^65] *Men* had a similar gift, but less marked and less
*skilled*, as they were less skilled in all *artistic* matter: *language
being the primary art*; hence their ruder tongues were much improved by
contact, later, with []{#calibre_link-1582 aria-label="35"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Quendi; and the general similarity -- apart from
loan-words -- of *Western* speeches of Men with Quendian.)[^66]

Quendi, it must be assumed, had from the beginning a natural rate of
"growth" and "life", which was not in the early ages much altered
anywhere: thus from the beginning we can reckon with a 12 : 1 rate (as
compared with Men) of "growth", and a subsequent 144 : 1, or Valian,
rate of "ageing".

Their *first generation*, or "First Elves", awoke at the time of first
maturity -- *see later Legend*;[^67] and they began at once to increase
with great rapidity in the *first three generations*, though this
afterwards slowed down.

The Quendi never "fell" in the sense that Men did.[^68] Being "tainted"
with the Shadow (as perhaps even the Valar in some degree were, with all
things in "Arda Marred") they could *do wrong*. But they *never rejected
Eru*, or worshipped Melkor (or Sauron) either individually,[^69] or in
groups, or as a whole people. Their lives, therefore, came under no
general curse or diminishment, and their "life-span", coextensive with
the remainder of the life of Arda, was unaltered -- except only insofar
as, with the very ageing of Arda itself, their *primitive vigour of
body* steadily waned. But the "waning" does not yet appreciably affect
the periods dealt with in the Silmarillion.

The "lives" of the Quendi cannot be supposed to be affected by living in
Middle-earth "under the Sun" -- NOT IF as now seems certain the Sun is
made part of the original structure of Arda, and not devised only after
the Death of the Trees -- since they were *devised to live* in
Middle-earth and "under the Sun".[^70] Any alteration (if any!) would
occur under the "artificial" conditions of Aman. But since the Quendian
rate of "ageing" was already that of the Valar (144 : 1) the alteration
would only concern the *growth rate* (12 : 1) : this might well be
slowed to 36 : 1 or 72 : 1 or even 144 : 1.[^71]

When therefore Oromë found the Quendi in, say, VY 1090, the *increase*
can be approximately calculated. According to the "legend" and the
theory set out below: the Quendi in about VY 1100 would have numbered
over 32,000.[^72] This is probably adequate IF we allow the begetting of
Children on the Great March: as shown also in what follows.

[]{#calibre_link-1583 aria-label="36" role="doc-pagebreak"}II. Note on
Angband and Utumno[^73]
:::

In the *Tale of Years* Morgoth has *insufficient time* for the building
and organization of Angband. He thus escapes in VY 1495 and only 20
*löar* later (VY 1497) is already assailing Beleriand (before the making
of the Sun!).[^74][^75]

*Plainly* EITHER Angband must be *on the same site* as Utumno, which
being actually partially destroyed, and its depths never plumbed, was
quickly restored; OR Angband must in some form have already existed.

*The latter is greatly to be preferred*. A fort far West and not far
from the Sea would be a natural strategic device by Melkor for
preventing the Valar coming in force against him, or for delaying their
advance if they tried to assail him.

*This is the probable story* ☞. As soon as he discovered the Quendi (if
not indeed far sooner, and well before the time of their awaking, which
Melkor guessed more shrewdly than the Valar) Melkor constructed Angband.
One of its chief functions was not only to defend the Western Shores,
but to *shroud them*. The prime function of (originally volcanic)
Thangorodrim was to produce *smokes*, *vapours, and darkness*. All the
Northwest shores were covered and the Sun largely excluded for hundreds
of years before Melkor was made captive. Sauron had a chief part in
this; and when the Valar at last came to Middle-earth he (under Melkor's
orders) made a strong feint of resistance, while Melkor retreated and
gathered nearly all his forces in Utumno. (Thus passage of the Quendi
was made feasible.) Angband was in the event very largely destroyed --
though the Valar, passing on to Utumno, which was apparently the real
centre of Melkor's power -- made no attempt to demolish it completely.
But when Melkor feigned submission to Manwë, Sauron was ordered to
reconstruct it (as *secretly* as possible: therefore largely in
extending its underground mansions) against Melkor's escape and return.
*There were no more fumes* until Melkor returned: but when he did in
1495, Angband was almost ready. Melkor then made it his chief seat of
power, for strategic reasons, and because of the coming of the Eldar.
Had he been successful he would perhaps have returned to Utumno, but
*not* until the Eldar were vanquished or destroyed.

::: ext
The second version greatly expanded upon the much-compressed first
version, except where the matters of the awaking of Men and of the
position and nature of Angband with respect to Utumno are concerned, and
of both of these matters with respect to the time of the death of the
Two Trees, of Melkor's flight, and of the Exile of the Noldor. On these
matters the first version, which shows much more of Tolkien's
deliberative process concerning them, reads:
:::

Men must "awake" *before the Captivity of Melkor*.[^76][^77] *It is too*
late after the return to Angband; *for there is not enough time*: The
Atani already partly civilized reach Beleriand c. 310. That is only
about 310 Sun Years after Morgoth's return![^78][^79]

In any case Morgoth has precious little time in which to build Angband.
He escapes in 1495 and only 20 \[sun-\]years later (TY 1497) is already
assailing Beleriand.[^80]

Plainly Utumno and Angband must be in the *same place* and, only
partially destroyed, was quickly restored.[^81] Or, Angband must also
have existed.[^82] A *fort far west* would be a good device for keeping
the Valar out, and ill-informed of what was going on. Thus Melkor *as
soon as Elves awoke* must have constructed Angband in the West as a
further device -- *and he covered all northwest shores and the
hinterland with darkness, obscuring the Sun*.

But Angband was chiefly a place for making *smoke and dark*, and not yet
very big. When all the Valar came against him, Melkor made only a feint
of defending Angband, and then retreated to Utumno. This in the event
was pretty well destroyed, but was inhabited by Balrogs. These were
*secretly* (though Morgoth feigned submission) instructed to regain and
extend Angband (quietly and \[?within\] fume) against his escape.
Angband was therefore almost ready in 1495![^83][^84]

If (as in the *Tale of Years*) the Valar came forth in VY 1090 and
Utumno was besieged in 1092 and destroyed in 1100, then Men *must* awake
before VY 1090.[^85]

If they awoke in VY 1050 that would give 40 VYs, or 5,760 Sun
[]{#calibre_link-1585 aria-label="38" role="doc-pagebreak"}Years in
which Melkor could have dealings with them and corrupt them, before his
captivity. The Atani entered Beleriand in 310 Bel. That is in the 22^nd^
Sun-year of VY 1498. Men had then existed for 448 VYs + 22 SYs: i.e.,
64,534 Sun Years,[^86] which, though doubtless insufficient
scientifically (since that is only -- we being in 1960 of the 7^th^ Age
-- 16,000 years ago: total about 80,000), is adequate for purposes of
the *Silmarillion*, etc.[^87]

But Elves when discovered in 1085 were already a people, though appear
*never yet* to have met Men, who awoke much further east. ☞ *Cuiviénen*
must be *fairly far west* (near centre of Endor?).

We may suppose Elves awoke at least 50 VYs sooner than Men (sc. 7,200
mortal years). This is about sufficient.[^88] But it would be better to
reduce the time of Melkor's dealing with Men, since the damage could be
done in much less than 5,760 years of mortal life.

Let Melkor discover Men 1,440 years (that is, 10 VYs) before the Valar
open attack in VY 1090. Men will therefore "awake" -- the exact process
will *not* be disclosed or discussed in the *Silmarillion* -- some
(little) time before VY 1080; say, 1079/1075.[^89]

The Quendi should then awake at least soon enough for the first
generation to be full-grown when Oromë finds them; but also long enough
for Melkor to affect them seriously.[^90]

If Elves from the beginning grew at later rates: the *first generation*
would be "maturing" between 216 and 288 years after "awakening", but
they would not have reached *prime* (in early days, at age 100) for
another 76--82 Elven years = same number of VYs (or SYs
10,944--11,808).[^91] When therefore they were found by Oromë they must
have existed at least 11,000 years, or (say) 80 VYs. Oromë found them in
1085. They therefore almost certainly began to be c. VY 1000.

Quendi awake VY 1000.

Men awake VY 1075 (and are hidden from other contacts by Melkor)? But
Eru independently of Manwë sends messages and *messengers* to them (and
the Elves). That is about 10,800 Sun-years after Elves \[awoke\] and 15
VYs (or 2,160 SYs) before the attack of the Valar. The Valar *do not
discover Men* (whose centre was far south of Utumno),[^92] and think the
removal of Melkor probably sufficient protection: they are not supposed
to "meddle" with Men, but only guard them so that they can develop as
they should. But they are *anxious*, especially after they discover that
Melkor had already affected the Quendi; and are aware that by no means
all of Melkor's evil associates and forces had been destroyed or
captured. They are therefore always sending out emissaries and explorers
to Middle-earth during the Captivity of Melkor.[]{#calibre_link-1586

*Quendi*
:::

If we take VY 1000 as the probable date of the "Awakening" and 1085 of
the "Finding" (by Oromë); 1090: beginning of the Assault of the Valar;
1102: Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë brought to Valinor; 1105: beginning of the
Great March; 1115: separation of the Nandor; 1125: Eldar reach
Beleriand; 1130: Thingol lost; 1133: Vanyar and Ñoldor land in Aman;
then we must consider the matter of the Eldar, and the ages and position
of Ingwë, etc.

In 1085 Oromë found already a considerable people (who had already had
dealings with emissaries of Melkor).

*According to Eldarin tradition*: The Quendi "awoke" in maturity of
body, and had "slept" during the making of their *hröar* "in the womb or
Arda"; but when they awoke they were in *12 pairs*, elf-man and
elf-woman lying side-by-side each with a "predestined" mate. After 1
*löa* they begat children; so that in "Awakening \[Year\] 10" the
First-begotten or so-called 1st generation began to appear. The Quendi
were at first eager to increase their kind; *on the average* they begat
children, at the age of 40, and at average intervals of 24 years.
[]{#calibre_link-1591 aria-label="44" role="doc-pagebreak"}In the first
three generations the number of children born to each pair was 6. In the
next three generations the average number was 5; in subsequent
generations up to the Great March the average number was 4. (During the
Great March very few children were begotten, and there were no new
marriages.) The number of males and females was at first equal (for
about three generations) but more variable later, when males tended to
be slightly more numerous.

The number of children per pair now drops to five, and pairing is not
exact. The interval between children also increased to about 30, so
total time to produce the 4^th^ generation was the same, 120 *löar*.

The youngest of the 7^th^ generation would be active and able to march
in some 10 growth-years = 120 *löar*; sc. VY 1109/140, or say VY 1110.

The dates for the March etc. given in the *Tale of Years* are devised to
fit scale 10 *löar* = 1 VY; but even so are too long? The Eldar take 20
VY = 200 \[sun-\]years to reach Beleriand. But we must imagine many
*long halts* and waverings. Also the Eldar *still desired children*, and
no doubt *begot many on the March*. But they would *halt* for this
purpose. Halts would occupy at least 10 \[sun-\]years (gestation 9 +
mother's rest) + 10 growth-years (120 \[SY\]) = 130 \[*löar*\] for
youngest children to grow to marching age.[^96] They would then march on
during an interval of about 30 \[sun-\]years; and halt 130 \[*löar*\]
again.[^97] Let us say the March began in VY 1110, when the total number
of Quendi was about 15,000.

Suppose 10,000 marched (Eldar), and 5,000 Avari remained: Ingar 1,000,
Noldor 3,500, Teleri 5,500 (*later* Lindar -- Sindar -- Nandor).[^98]

Distance? Beleriand was about 550 miles broad from Eglarest to the
Mountains of Lune. From the Mountains of Lune to the Sea of Rhûn is,
according to the LR map over 1,250 miles: \[total\] 1,750 miles. How far
east or southeast of the Sea of Rhûn was Cuiviénen?[^99] If we say in
ancient days that Cuiviénen was 2,000 miles as the crow flies from the
coast of ancient Beleriand this will be approximately right.

Let 10,000 Eldar set out at the beginning of VY 1110. The begetting of
the 8th generation is due to begin in VY 1108/64 + VY 18/9 = VY 1126/73.
But then 16 VY = 2,304 \[sun-\]years will have elapsed! (It *could*
begin in VY 1108/64 + 2 VY = VY 1110/64 when the 7^th^ generation would
be 24 \[growth-\] years \[= 288 *löar*\] old.)[^100]

Clearly *either* no more children are begotten before reaching Valinor,
*or* the March must have been delayed.

Let the March begin when the youngest of the 8^th^ gen. are at least 10
\[growth-\]years old (= 120 solar years), so in VY 1127/29 + 120. This
is in VY 1128/5 or *early* in 1129. Let 20,000 march (leaving 9,060 or
about 9,000 Avari). Ingar 2,000, Ñoldor 7,000, Teleri 11,000. No more
begetting of the 9^th^ gen. will occur regularly until VY 1126/73 + 18/9

Too many children, so probably *delay march* until maturity (288
\[sun-\]years) after the birth of the youngest of the 8^th^ gen. If
1127/29 + 2 VY (= 288 \[sun-\]years) = 1129/29 or early 1129. The
youngest marchers will be 24 \[growth-years\] (288 \[sun-\]years) old,
the oldest 168 *löar* or 1VY/24 older. But begetting of a 9^th^
generation would now be possible for, say, 4,000 pairs of the 8^th^

*Now begins negotiation for transport*

::: ext
Having at last brought the Host of the Great March to the coast of
Beleriand, and having detailed the time it took and their population
increase along the way, Tolkien goes on to compare this new scheme with
that of the scheme of the *Tale of Years* (see X:49, 56--7), and to
consider its implications, particularly as arising from Finwë's
abstaining from wedding before reaching Aman:
:::

In the "Tale of Years" the Eldar reach the coast in VY 1125 (only 20 VY
= 200 \[sun-\]years on the March).[^115] Ulmo takes the Ingar and Ñoldor
in 1132; they arrive in Aman in 1133. The Teleri leave in 1150. VY here
\[i.e., in the "Tale of Years"\] = 10 sun-years. The Eldar (Ingar and
Ñoldor) only abide in Beleriand 7 × 10 = 70 sun-years. It only takes 10
sun-years to cross the Great Sea. The Teleri depart 180 sun-years later.
Except for passage of the Great Sea, these lengths \[of time\] are
sufficient?

*In the above scheme* the Eldar reach the coast in 1132/17. The March
began in 1129/29: they were nearly 3 VY in migration = 420 sun-years.
They should abide 1 VY (1133/17) before the Ingar and Ñoldor depart.
Transit \[across the Great Sea\] = 12 \[sun-\]years. The Teleri now go
to the shores and are befriended by Ossë. Part of the Teleri and Olwë
are taken off in 1134.

In the "Tale of Years" Finwë begets Fëanor in 1160 and he is born in VY
1169.[^116] This is (according to TY scale) 27 VY = 270 \[sun-\]years
after Finwë's arrival in Valinor.[^117]

Where in the present scheme did the chieftains come in? Ingwë, Finwë,
Elwë (Olwë)? If "First Elves" they awoke in VY 1000, being approximately
24 age-years old. In VY 1133/29 they reach Valinor. They are then 24 +
133/29 VY old = 24 +133 = 157 age-years; actually 288 + 19,152 = 19,440
\[sun-years\].

Clearly *Finwë cannot wed in Aman* unless the arrangement of Elvish
lives is *altered*. It could be altered satisfactorily in this way:

::: ext
1\. The Eldar, especially in the early ages, do not wed or beget until
late, and maybe at least 200 years old.

[]{#calibre_link-1600 aria-label="53" role="doc-pagebreak"}2. They do
not necessarily beget in consecutive Times of the Children; but may
beget in any suitable or peaceful time, at will. But they do not beget
when past *hröa*-prime, which was in the Elder Days about 200 age-years
(but this dwindled: in the Second Age it was 150, in Third Age 100).
:::

Ingwë, Finwë etc. could postpone wedding till arrival (and probably did
not expect to be so long on the road). If so, however, it might be a
good thing to have few weddings on the March --: but Ingwë, Finwë, and
Elwë being special cases (as the only ones who had yet seen Aman, and so
desired the children to be born there), they could be among the few who
abstained \[i.e. from wedding before and during the March\]. If there
are few weddings on the March, then *either* Elves must awake longer
than 82 VY before their finding *or* far more must be "created": 144 (72
pairs), or 144 pairs?

But in any case -- how would Ingwë etc. or any "First Elf" know of what
was going to happen, so as to postpone marriage? How could
Elwë/Olwë/Elmo be "brothers"? Fairly clearly then Ingwë etc. are *not*
"First Elves". What then became of older generations?

This can be got over. The Quendi at first (to 3 gens.?) were very
*philoprogenitive*. They mated almost at once with their predestined
mates. It was not for *some time*, when their young, inexperienced
*fëar* began to take command, that their other faculties demanded
fulfilment, and they began to be absorbed in the study of Arda.[^118]
The *younger generations* therefore progressed rapidly in strength,
nobility, and intellectuality of character, and made natural leaders.
The first few generations (expending much vigour in begetting) were
least adventurous and were nearly all Avari in the event.

Secondly, *in any case*: Elvish lords or Kings (as Númenóreans later)
tended to hand on lordship and affairs to their descendants if they
could or were engrossed in some pursuit. Often (though we don't see it
in Beleriand, since the War occupied so short a span of Elvish-time, and
lords and Kings were so often slain), after passing 200 age-years they
would resign. It would thus be *young, eager Quendi* of some later
generations (whose fathers or grandfathers were lords) who were chosen
and/or willing to go as ambassadors to Aman -- after which they would be
preeminent and obvious leaders of the March. "The light of Aman was in
their faces", and the other Elves were in awe of them.

::: ext
Against this paragraph Tolkien placed a large "\*" and added a note:
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1601 aria-label="54" role="doc-pagebreak"}This is
better than making the Ambassadors different from the later leaders.

::: ext
He also drew vertical lines against the last two paragraphs on this
page, and in the upper left-hand corner he further added the word:
"Important", indicating his enthusiasm for these solutions. Important,
indeed, as these solutions to the problems -- of 1) reducing the number
of weddings (and thus begettings) of the Eldar on the March, while 2)
still having sufficient numbers of Elves to believably populate both
Aman and Beleriand, and 3) allowing Finwë to still be of marriageable
and begetting age when he arrives in Aman within the "age-year" scheme
laid out in these papers -- turn out to have been the germ of "The
Legend of the Awaking of the Quendi (*Cuivienyarna*)" given at
XI:420--4. For on the pages that immediately follow this discussion are
the germ and the rough working-out of the mechanics of that legend,
beginning:
:::

The "First Elves" awaking in VY 1000 should be 144: 72 pairs of
*destined spouses*. But they did not all wake at once from sleep "in the
womb of Arda". There were *three first Elves* known in later legend as
Imin, Tata, and Enel (from whom the Eldar said the words for 1, 2, and 3
were made: but the reverse was probably the historical fact).

::: ext
It is apparently here that the names and figures of Imin, Tata, and
Enel, as the first three male Elves to awake, first arose. For the
continuation of the development of this legend, see the next
chapter.[]{#calibre_link-1602 aria-label="55"

This text is written in black nib-pen on five sides of four sheets of
unlined paper. It dates from c. 1959.

As was seen at the end of the previous chapter, the legend of Imin,
Tata, and Enel arose in the context of Tolkien's desire to reduce the
number of weddings (and thus begettings) of the Eldar on the March,
while still having sufficient numbers of Elves to believably populate
both Aman and Beleriand, and yet allow Finwë to still be of marriageable
age when he arrives in Aman.

While the subsequent typescript version of this text, published in *The
War of the Jewels*, follows this manuscript (as emended) quite closely
(see *The* *legend of the Awaking of the Quendi* *(Cuivienyarna)*;
XI:420--4), there are enough differences of details and textual
development to warrant giving the full manuscript version here, in the
context in which the legend first arose.

Summary of the Eldarin

traditions concerning the "Awakening" and of the

*Legend of the Cuivië (Cuivienyarna)*
:::

During the waking of their first *hröar* from the "flesh of Arda" the
Quendi slept "in the womb of Arda", beneath the green sward, and "awoke"
when they were full-grown. But the "First Elves" (also called the
*Unbegotten*, or the *Eru-begotten*) did not all wake together. Eru had
so ordained that each should lie beside his or her "destined
spouse".[^119] But three Elves awoke first of all; and they were
elf-men, []{#calibre_link-1606 aria-label="60" role="doc-pagebreak"}for
elf-men are more strong in *hröa* and more eager and adventurous in
strange places.[^120] These three are named in the oldest traditions:
*Imin*, *Tata*, and *Enel*. They awoke in that order, but with little
time between each; and from them, say the Eldar, the words for 1, 2, and
3 were made: the oldest of all numerals.[^121][^122]

*Imin*, *Tata*, and *Enel* awoke before their spouses, and the first
thing that they saw was the stars, for they woke in the early twilight
before dawn. And the next thing they saw was their destined spouse lying
asleep on the green sward beside them.[^123] Then they were so enamoured
of their beauty that their desire for speech was immediately quickened
and they began "to think of words" to speak and sing in. And being
impatient they could not wait but woke up their spouses. Thus (say the
Eldar) elf-women ever after reached maturity sooner than elf-men; for it
had been intended that they should wake later than their spouses.[^124]

But after a time, when they had dwelt together a little and had devised
many words, Imin and Iminyë, Tata and Tatië, Enel and Enelyë walked
together, and left the green dell of their waking, and they came soon to
another dell and found there *six* pairs of Quendi, and the stars were
again shining in the morrow-dim and the elf-men were just waking.[^125]

Then Imin claimed to be the eldest and to have the right of first
choice; and he said, "I choose these twelve to be my companions". And
the elf-men woke their spouses, and when the eighteen Elves had dwelt
together a little and had learned many words and devised more, they
walked on together, and soon in another even deeper and wider hollow
they found *nine* pairs of Quendi, and the elf-men had just waked in the
starlight.

Then Tata claimed the right of second choice, and he said: "I choose
these eighteen to be my companions". Then again the elf-men woke their
spouses, and they dwelt and spoke together, and devised many new sounds
and new and longer words;[^126] and then the thirty-six walked abroad
together, until they came to a grove of birches by a stream, and there
they found *twelve* pairs of Quendi, and the elf-men likewise were just
standing up, and looking at the stars through the birch boughs.

Then Enel claimed the right of third choice, and he said:
[]{#calibre_link-1607 aria-label="61" role="doc-pagebreak"}"I choose
these twenty-four to be my companions". Again the elf-men woke their
spouses; and for many days the sixty Elves dwelt by the stream, and soon
they began to make verse and song to the music of the water.

At length they all set out together again. But Imin noticed that each
time they had found more Quendi than before, and he thought to himself:
"I have only twelve companions (although I am the eldest); I will take a
later choice". Soon they came to a sweet-smelling firwood on a
hill-side, and there they found *eighteen* pairs of Quendi, and all were
still sleeping. It was still night and clouds were in the sky. But
before dawn a wind came, and roused the elf-men, and they woke and were
amazed at the stars; for all the clouds were blown away and the stars
were bright from east to west. And for a long time the eighteen new
Quendi took no heed of the others, but looked at the light of *Menel*.
But when at last they turned their eyes back to earth they beheld their
spouses and woke them to look at the stars, crying to them *elen,
elen!*[^127] And so the stars got their name.

Now Imin said: "I will not choose again yet"; and Tata, therefore, chose
these thirty-six to be his own companions; and they were tall and
dark-haired and strong like the fir-trees, and from them most of the
Ñoldor later were sprung.

And the ninety-six Quendi now spoke together, and the newly-waked
devised many new and beautiful words, and many cunning artifices of
speech; and they laughed, and danced upon the hill-side, until at last
they desired to find more companions. Then they all set out again
together, until they came to a lake dark in the twilight, and there was
a great cliff above it upon the east side, and a waterfall came down
from the height, and the stars glittered on the foam. But the elf-men
were already bathing in the waterfall, and they had waked their spouses.
There were *twenty-four* pairs; but as yet they had no formed speech,
though they sang sweetly and their voices echoed in the stone, mingling
with the rush of the falls.

But again Imin withheld his choice, thinking "next time it will be a
great company". Therefore Enel said: "I have the choice, and I choose
these forty-eight to be my companions". And the hundred and forty-four
Quendi dwelt long together by the lake, until they all became of one
mind and speech, and were glad.[^128]

At length Imin said: "It is time now that we should go on and seek more
companions". But most of the others were content. So Imin and Iminyë and
their twelve companions set out, and they walked long by day and by
twilight in all the country about the Lake, near which all the Quendi
had awakened -- for which reason it is called []{#calibre_link-1608
aria-label="62" role="doc-pagebreak"}*Cuiviénen*.[^129] But they never
found any more companions: for the tale of the First Elves was complete.

And so it was that the Quendi ever after reckoned in *twelves*, and that
144 was for long their highest number, so that in none of their later
tongues was there any common name for greater numbers.[^130] And so also
it came about that the "Companions of Imin" or the Eldest Company (of
whom came the Ingar)[^131] were nonetheless only 14 in all; and the
smallest company; and the "Companions of Tata" (of whom came the Ñoldor)
were 56 in all; but the "Companions of Enel" although the Youngest
Company were the largest. From them came the Teleri (or Lindar), and
they were in the beginning 74 in all.[^132]

Now the Quendi loved all of Arda that they had yet seen, and green
things that grow, and the sun of summer, were their delight; but
nonetheless they were ever moved most in heart by the Stars, and the
hours of twilight, at "morrow-dim" and "even-dim" in clear weather were
the times of their greatest joy.[^133] For in those hours in the spring
of the year they had first awakened to life in Arda. But the Lindar,
above all the other Quendi, from their beginning were most in love with
water, and sang before they could speak.[]{#calibre_link-1609

*Time-scales and "rates of growth"*
:::

  ------------------- --------------------------- ----------------
                      **Valian Year of Ageing**   **Mortal Men**
                      1                           144
  Original Quendian   1                           144
  Later               25/36                       100
  ------------------- --------------------------- ----------------

The Quendian rate originally corresponded to the Valian and it so
remained in Aman. But by each act or choice which as it were allied the
Quendi, or any group of them, more closely with "Arda Marred", the rate
of "growth" became quicker (for the tendency towards physical decay was
increased).

It is said that the Avari quickened to 100 : 1 as soon as the Eldar had
departed; that the Nandor did likewise as soon as they forsook the
[]{#calibre_link-1611 aria-label="65" role="doc-pagebreak"}March; that
the Sindar did so also when they chose to remain on the Western Shores;
and that finally the exiled Ñoldor were quickened in the same way as
soon as they left Aman, or rather as soon as the Doom of Mandos was
spoken and they persisted in their rebellion.[^134]

In all the earlier legends, therefore, the rate 100 : 1 can be used to
determine approximately the age of any of the Eldar in human terms
(except while they were in Aman where it is 144 : 1).

It is said that after the fall of Sauron, and the beginning of the
Fourth Age and the Dominion of Men, those of the Elves who still
lingered in Middle-earth were again "quickened" to a rate of about 72 :
1, or in these latter days to 48 : 1.[^135]

::: ext
Some calculations
:::

It will be seen that the dates given in the "Lord of the Rings" fit well
with these rates, *save in two points*.

The rate of the *Half-elven* that chose to join the Quendi was evidently
in Middle-earth 100 : 1. (For those who joined Men a special rate of
growth was established, approximately 3 : 1, though this diminished, but
was in Aragorn almost restored: he was 5 : 2).[^136]

*Elrond*. He was born 58 \[sun-\]years before the end of the First Age
in the overthrow of Morgoth;[^137] but he was born in Middle-earth and
so inherited from the beginning the rate 100 : 1. He lived then through
the Second Age of Middle-earth: 3,441 years. He wedded Celebrían in TA
100 (it is said),[^138] and left Middle-earth at the end of the Third
Age (3021). He said that in the Last Alliance (SA 3430) he was "the
herald of Gil-galad".[^139]

We see therefore that when he left Middle-earth he was 58 + 3,441 +
3,021 years old = 6,520. He was then in human terms just over 65 and
still in full vigour.[^140]

At the Last Alliance he was 58 + 3,430 = 3,488 ÷ 100 = nearly 35. At his
wedding he was 58 + 3,441 + 100 = 3,599 ÷ 100 = 36.

*Celebrían* was born (it seems) early in the Second Age, when Galadriel
refused to return to Eressëa, and passed over the Mountains. Probably SA
300. At her wedding with Elrond therefore she would be 3,441 -- 300 +
100 = 3,241 years old, or 32. A reasonable age, and further to be
explained by the fact that her marriage was postponed by the War of the
Last Alliance, and the preceding troubles in Eriador. At her departure
from Middle-earth in TA 2509 she was 3,141 + 2,509 = 5,650 years old, or
56.[^141]

[]{#calibre_link-1612 aria-label="66" role="doc-pagebreak"}*Arwen*. She
was born (according to LR) in TA 241. She was married to Aragorn in TA
3019. She was then 2,778 years old, or in human terms nearly 28. This in
elvish terms is a very suitable age. Her wedding was in any case
inevitably postponed by the War of the Ring and the preceding troubles.
Also, in 2951, when Aragorn first met her, she was 2,710, or 27, whereas
he was then 20: he had yet to overtake her, which in this case was
desirable, since she was to become mortal in his degree. In 2980 when
they plighted their troth in Lórien she was very little older, but he
was 49.[^142]

Now *Aragorn* was born in TA 2931, but lived until 4A 100, and was then
of full age, but not yet becoming senile. His years were then 190.[^143]
He was the "last of the Númenóreans", and his span was equal to the
Kings of Men of old (as is said): thrice that of ordinary Men. Actually,
his rate was probably rather 5 : 2 than 3 : 1: so that he was at his
wedding in TA 3019 in years 88, in age 35; and at death in years 190, in
age 75. (The full Númenórean rate would make him 29 at his wedding and
63 at death.)[^144]

It would appear that the "grace" accorded to the Númenóreans was like
that of Aman: it did *not* alter the human rate of growth to maturity,
but postponed the decay of old age after that for a long while -- until
one knew inwardly (by a motion of the *fëa*) that the time had come to
relinquish life in this world *voluntarily*.[^145] If one did not do so,
but clung to life, senility would soon arise. If Aragorn had yielded to
Arwen's entreaties, he would have become decrepit, at least in body,
very soon.

*Galadriel*. She was born in Aman. At the exile she was young and eager,
just at or upon the threshold of maturity: probably in age about 20. She
must therefore have been in years about 20 × 144 = 2,880. She became
acquainted with Celeborn (a Sindarin prince, and kinsman of Thingol) in
Beleriand. But there were few marriages or child-births among the Eldar
during the War with Angband, which though it occupied 590 years,[^146]
was to the Eldar in "ageing time" only a matter of some *six*
year-equivalents. She probably married Celeborn soon after the overthrow
of Morgoth, and when she (it appears, because of love for Celeborn, who
would not leave Middle-earth yet) declined to return West to
Eressëa,[^147] they passed together over the "Mountains of Lune" into
Eriador.[^148] She was then about 26 in age, for the years in
[]{#calibre_link-1613 aria-label="67" role="doc-pagebreak"}Beleriand had
been at the ageing-rate of 100 : 1. In SA 300 or thereabout (3
\[life-\]years later) she bore Celebrían in Eriador. She was then about
29. She lived through all the remainder of the Second Age to SA 3441,
and left Middle-earth in TA 3021. She was thus at that time in
\[life-\]years 20 + (3441+3021)/100= 20 + 70.5, or 90 and a half years
in age;[^149] and thus in elven-terms, according to the time in which
the "fading" of the Quendi was approaching, now passing the prime of her
*hröa*.

As can be seen, these calculations show that the events and dates (of
LR) are well-fitted to Elvish nature, and are evidently in the main
correctly reported. But there are *two points* in which *error* appears:
probably of scribal origin.

It is stated in the *Tale of Years* that Elrond married Celebrían in TA
100, and that his twin sons (Elladan and Elrohir) were born in TA 139,
and Arwen in TA 241. This must be erroneous: for in TA 139 only 39
years, or in "ageing terms" of the Eldar and the Half-elven, 2/5 of a
year had passed since Elrond's wedding. This was impossible.[^150]

Also, in TA 241 only 102 years had passed since the birth of the twins,
which is not much more than a year of ageing time, and though not
impossible is according to Elvish nature and behaviour, entirely
improbable. (Especially after the birth of twins, and in the begetting
and bearing of a special child of high excellence.)

It is thus probable that 100 and 241 are errors for 10 and 341: for
these are in the circumstances easy errors to make; and it will be
observed that if 10 and 341 are substituted the entries \[i.e., in the
published *Tale of Years* in App. B\] are not displaced from their
present position.

With these emendations we shall see that Celebrían and Elrond were at
their wedding 90 years, or less than 1 \[life-year\], younger than as
stated. This is of no great concern. But the birth of the twins was 129
years later or 1.29 \[life-years\], which is about a year and four
months, which is in elven-terms very probable. The birth of Arwen was
then 202 years later again, or about 2 \[life-\]years. This is possible
though sooner than would be expected.[^151]

No more children were born to Elrond, though Celebrían did not leave
Middle-earth until 2509, when she was in years about 5,650, or about 56½
\[life-years\]. This is no doubt related to the birth of twins,
[]{#calibre_link-1614 aria-label="68" role="doc-pagebreak"}and still
more to the fact that Arwen was a "special child" of great powers and
beauty.

::: ext
In later marginal notes in blue ball-point pen against the two
paragraphs beginning at "This must be erroneous", he reconsidered the
changes proposed in them:
:::

No. For child-growth (including time in the womb) to maturity was at
rate 10 : 1. Gestation took 8 years (= 96 months). \[TA\] 139 is
therefore quite possible. But the resting in ageing time of *parents*
was at the 100 : 1 \[rate\]. So 200 years should intervene. Sc. the
conception of Elladan and Elrohir \[should be in\] 131, born 139. Arwen
begotten 333 born 341, after 194 or nearly 2 \[life-\]years of rest.

::: ext
Although Tolkien did later change the birth-year of Elladan and Elrohir
to 130 in the second edition (1966) of *LR* App. B, he in the event made
no change to that of Arwen.[]{#calibre_link-1615 aria-label="69"

This text is written, in a (mostly) clear hand in black nib-pen, on six
sides of three sheets of printed copies of a memo proceeding from a
College Meeting that took place on 21 June 1955, during Tolkien's period
of office as the Sub-warden of Merton College. There are however several
reasons to date this text somewhat later than 1955. First, it uses *ab
initio* the Quenya word *hröa* for 'body', but there is no evidence that
that word was in use until after the typescript text B of *Laws and
Customs among the Eldar* was made in c. 1958 (see X:141--42, 304).
Second, it refers to specifics of the differing rates of Elvish ageing
in Aman and in Beleriand as though already introduced and adopted ("144
SY in Aman = 1 year of Elf-life, but 100 SY in Beleriand = 1 year"),
whereas there is no evidence that this difference was introduced before
c. 1959, sc. in the text presented here as chap. IV, "Time-scales",
above; and further, it is in that text that Tolkien appears first to
have noted the difficulty presented by the birth of Maeglin in Beleriand
that is central to this text. Third, near the end of this text it
specifically cites Celebrían's age in TA 10, a year that has no
significance except that in the c. 1959 text presented in the previous
chapter, TA 10 was suggested as a correction for the year that Elrond
and Celebrían wed. I therefore think the text in fact dates, like so
many others in the "Time and Ageing" file, from c. 1959.

For similar applications of the greatly increased rate of Sun-years to
Valian Years of 144 : 1 to specific characters in the *legendarium*, see
the texts presented here as chaps. IX, "Times-scales and Rates of
Growth"; XI, "Ageing of Elves"; and XVIII, "Elvish Ages & Númenórean".
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1617 aria-label="71" role="doc-pagebreak"}Grave
difficulty will be found in the chronology on the scales 144 SY in Aman
= 1 year of Elf-life, but 100 SY in Beleriand = 1 year. For no Elf not
born in Aman would be of age to marry (though there might be numerous
children), since the whole time (approximately 590 years) of the War
against Morgoth was only equivalent to about 6 life-years of the Eldar.
Any marriageable Elda would then have to be at least 20 \[life-years\]
and therefore have been born 14 to 20 \[Valian\] years before VY 1500
when Beleriandic reckoning begins: i.e. \[Valian\] 11 to 15 years before
the Exile began.

It would on whole be best to have *no* Exilic children (born in
Beleriand) coming into the tale. But the case of Maeglin cannot be got
round. The narrative makes it inevitable that he should have been born
*after the occupation of Gondolin* in Bel. 116. At the period of Tuor's
coming to Gondolin (Bel. 495) or wedding with Idril (502), he would if
born in (say) Bel. 120 be c. 375 or c. 382 years old -- but that only =
less than 4 \[life-\]years old.[^152]

(Isfin must either stray -- *refusing to be married in Gondolin* -- or
soon depart again, say after 120/125. Best is that she should refuse and
be forced, and *soon escape*. So that Maeglin would be born c. Bel.
120.)[^153]

Solution 1) Elves *married late* in Aman (usually). They became adult at
life-age 20, but that = 20 VY = 2,880; but they remained very young and
vigorous (and youthful in mind and interests) so that often they did not
wed until they were 200 life-years old or nearly that: sc. when 28,800
Sun-years old!

2\) But *under the Sun* (outside Varda's Domes) all the Eldar had
quickened *in growth*, though they had not lost (at first) much of their
steadfastness in vigour and health at that point. They therefore reached
maturity 10 times quicker or became 20 when only *200* \[sun-\]years
old; they then maintained this vigour, ageing only at the rate of 100
years = 1 life-year.

(Note in the "Tale of Years" that 5 VY is allowed for the wanderings of
the Exiles, 1495 to 1500,[^154] but that was reckoned on a scale of 1 VY
= 10 SY, and so was *insufficient*, being only 50 Sun-years. It is now
*far too much*, being 720 years! Adequate would be 1 Valian Year = 144
\[SY\]. Therefore the Crossing of the Ice should be in FA 1496.)

To find the approximate age-equivalence therefore in mortal years: *For
those born in Aman* reckon years in Aman as if mortal (or divide real
number of Sun-years by 144) up to FA 1496; then divide
[]{#calibre_link-850 aria-label="72" role="doc-pagebreak"}Beleriand
Years by 100. Thus an Elda born in Aman in 1475 would be 20 at the
Exile, 21 at arrival in Middle-earth, + 590/100 \[older\] at the fall of
Morgoth = about 27.

*For those born in Beleriand*. *Maeglin* for example, born in Bel. 120,
was in only 200 years (= 20) an adult: sc. he was in life-age 20 in Bel.
320. But in 495, when Tuor came to Gondolin, he was only (495-320)/100
years older: sc. 175/100 = less than 2 years or about 22. When Maeglin
came to Gondolin c. 400 he was thus 20 + 80/100 years old. It was this
*disparity of age* (and experience) that made him distasteful to Idril.

*Tuor* was born in 472. He came to Gondolin in 495, being then 23. He
married *Idril* in 502, being then 30. To look on him with any favour
Idril must have been young, about the *equivalent* of 22/23 in 495. To
reach 22 in 495 she must (if born in Beleriand) have taken 200 years to
become 20 and then 400 years to become 22: sc. 600 years. *She cannot
have been born in Beleriand* (in fact she was not, as her mother Anairë
refused the Exile, but Idril adhered to her father).[^155] If born in
Aman her 495 years in Beleriand = about 5 years of her life. She must
therefore have been 17 on entry into Beleriand and have been born in VY
1496 -- 17 = 1479.

If born in Aman, it must be remembered that if they were not yet adult,
the rate of growth would become 10 = 1 when they set foot in
Middle-earth (or probably as soon as the Doom of Mandos was spoken in VY
1495).

Thus Finduilas is evidently very young in 490 when Túrin comes to
Nargothrond; but she had already been (virtually?) betrothed to Gwindor
before the Nirnaeth in 472. (Túrin had had a hard life and had commanded
men, so at 26 (born 464) he would seem to her a hardened warrior of full
maturity.) If we say she was only 20 in 490, she could have reached that
age in 200 years and need only have been born in Bel. 290. In 472 she
would have been 1--8 years younger: about 18. But she was probably older
in 472, say 20 then at least: in which case she could have been born in
Bel. 272 and she would not be appreciably older in 490. But she could
have been born in Aman in say 1486, being 9 at the Exile, 10 on entry to
Beleriand. She would then need 100 years to become 20 in Bel. 100. In
490 she would be nearly 24.

A better solution is 3) The *Rate of Growth* of those *born in
Beleriand* was 10 = 1. But of those born in Aman it was 50 = 1 in
Beleriand.[^156] But it *began* to increase as soon as they left
Valinor,[^157] say after the []{#calibre_link-1618 aria-label="73"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Doom of Mandos. The Valian Year spent in reaching
Beleriand via the ice *aged all the Exiles* about 2 years (it took 144
Sun-years) = 72[^158] (but Fëanor reached Beleriand in one half the time
= Bel. 50 and so only aged 1 year). As soon as they reached Beleriand
the rate quickened to 50 = 1. Thus Finduilas, 12 in 1495, was 13 at 1496
and needed 7 years to become 20. This took her 7 × 50 = 350 years. She
was therefore 20 in Bel. 350. In Bel. 472 she was however only 122
Sun-years older, only just over 21, and in 490 only 140 Sun-years older:
nearly 21½.[^159] *She was the youngest Exile*.

*Galadriel* is known to have been "young and eager" at the Exile in
1495. If she was then 20, she would be 22 at the end of 1496, but by
Bel. 590 at the destruction of Beleriand only about 6 years older, say
28. She wedded Celeborn about that time and went into Eriador;[^160] but
they did not beget any children until they had settled (first near to
Evendim), that is, about SA 250. She was then 30½. *Celebrían* would be
born about SA 260. She would be 20 therefore in SA 460, and at the end
of the Second Age would be 20 + (3441-460)/100 (=2981/100) = 50.

::: ext
Here the text devolves into a series of rough notes and calculations,
among which are:
:::

Gestation of Elves 9 months life-time = in Bel. 900 months.[^161]

But should it suffer *law of growth*. All children together in
Middle-earth were made to 10 = 1 law ... gestation took 96 months
(longer than men) = 8 years.

At end of SA 3441 she \[Galadriel\] was 28 + 34.41 years old = 62. At
end of Third Age she was 30.21 years older -- 92.62 and so approximately
the time of the Prime of the *hröa*.

Celebrían born SA 350. Galadriel did not wed Celeborn till they were
settled. \[Celebrían\] was 20 in 550, in TA 10, 2,901 years later, she
was 49.

Eärendil obtained "long youth" for his sons and their immediate
descendants.[^162] Elrond, an Elf, has 1,000-year youth; he was thus 20
in SA 1000 -- 58 = 942. At end of TA he was in years 3,441 + 3,021 + 58
= 6,520 = 5,520 + 20 = 75. In \[SA\] 1697 \[the founding of Rivendell\]
he was 27.[]{#calibre_link-840 aria-label="74" role="doc-pagebreak"}

This is (for the most part) a clear manuscript written in black nib-pen
on eight sides of four unlined sheets that Tolkien numbered, in pencil,
1--8. Some corrections and marginal notes were made by Tolkien in red
ball-point pen. It dates from c. 1959.

For similar applications of the greatly increased rate of Sun-years to
Valian Years of 144 : 1 to specific characters in the *legendarium*, see
the texts presented here as chaps. IX, "Times-scales and Rates of
Growth"; X, "Difficulties in Chronology"; and XVIII, "Elvish Ages &
Númenórean".

*Ageing of Elves*
:::

*Adjustment* must be made of these rates to fit the narrative; at least
if the story of Maeglin's origin is kept as in the "Annals". For Maeglin
is evidently of an age to desire Idril in marriage, *but he was born in
Beleriand*. (The date in the Annals is impossible: SY 316. Maeglin would
then be about 179 when Tuor came to Gondolin in SY 495; but he would on
the 100 : 1 scale be less than 2 years old in life-age!)[^163] Gondolin
was occupied in SY 116.[^164] Isfin therefore cannot have borne Maeglin
before, say, 120 -- even if she refused entry to Gondolin, not wishing
to be "immured", or escaped soon after Turgon compelled her to enter. So
that at best Maeglin would only be 375 years old in SY 495.

Thus *either* (a) the story must be altered; *or* (b) scales of growth
must be adjusted.

[]{#calibre_link-1620 aria-label="76" role="doc-pagebreak"}(a) Maeglin
must be born at least 20 × 100 or 25 × 100 sun-years before SY 495: that
is (on present notation with VY reckoning ending at 1496 and MY 1 then
beginning) about 2,000 or 2,500 years before MY 495: sc. in 1,500 to
2,000 years before the coming of the Ñoldor in MY 1. That is, since 1 VY
= 144 MY, about VY 1484 or 1486. This is difficult or impossible to work
with if Isfin = sister of Turgon (as is essential to the tale).

If Isfin was rebellious at the time of the departure of the Eldar over
Sea (VY 1132)[^165] -- as it might be said were a few of the Ñoldor also
-- then matters might be arranged so:

Eöl was not a "Dark-elf", in the sense of being an Avar (none of these
in fact existed in Beleriand, certainly not at so early an age); nor was
he of the Teleri. There were a few of the Ñoldor who in heart were
"Avari", but marched because all their people did.[^166] Eöl was one of
these. He did not wish for Aman. *Either* he already knew and desired
Isfin, and persuaded her to remain behind, *or* she met him in Beleriand
when she too had refused to go at the last minute, and went wandering
alone in the land. In that case the birth of Maeglin could be anywhere
about VY 1232 to (say) 1400. If born in VY 1232, by VY 1496 Maeglin
would have lived 264 VY × 144 sun-years = 38,016 years! But this is
obviously impossible -- besides the fact that *Turgon and Isfin were
both born in Aman![^167]*

The story must then be entirely altered, and Maeglin must also be born
in Aman. His sinister character will then be accounted for by the fact
that he (and his mother and father) were specially attracted by Melkor,
and grew to dislike Aman, and their kin. They joined the host of Fëanor
(this would explain Eöl's skill in smith-craft!) and were estranged from
their immediate kin.

*Or* (b) The age or "growth" scale must be altered. In Aman in the early
ages it was very slow. The Eldar then lived at Valian rate: 144 : 1, but
also their youth *lasted very long*, and they were engaged in many
pursuits of absorbing interest, so that they did not become "mature" or
wed until aged over 100 \[VY\] or even nearly 200. This does not apply
of course to the first generation: e.g., Finwë was born in Middle-earth
some time before VY 1085 (when Oromë found the Quendi), say about 1050;
in 1132 he was therefore already 82 \[Valian\] years old and wedded
Míriel somewhere about 1150 when he was 18 \[Valian\] years older: sc.,
was about 100 \[VY\].

[]{#calibre_link-1621 aria-label="77" role="doc-pagebreak"}But this slow
growth was only maintained in Aman "under the domes of Varda".[^168] The
rate of growth "under the Sun" soon quickened. For all periods relative
to the narrative it may be taken as 10 : 1. That is, from conception to
maturity the Elvish *hröa* in Middle-earth only took 10 times the period
of Men. But reaching maturity at 20 they *then* remained in long-lasting
vigour with little perceptible change: i.e., the ageing rate was 144 :
1, or in Middle-earth 100 : 1. As soon as the Exiles left Valinor their
ageing and growing rate increased. Those who had to make way on foot and
cross the Ice spent a Valian year (= 144 \[sun-years\]) on the journey
after the doom of Mandos. This dreadful journey aged them all to an
extent of about 2 \[Valian\] years (or 72 : 1). As soon as they stepped
on Middle-earth the growth rate leapt to 10 : 1. Thus those who were
"mature" at the Exile must add 2 life-years to their age (or 1 if in the
company of Fëanor) before reaching Middle-earth; and then proceed at the
Middle-earth rate of 100 : 1. Those who were immature (under 20 \[VY\]
must add 2 years, and then complete their maturity (if necessary) in
Beleriand at a rate of 10 : 1, before proceeding to live at a 100 : 1
rate. (Since this growth rate affected the *hröa* as soon as conceived,
the gestation period was about 9 solar months × 10 = 90
\[months\].)[^169]

That being so, Maeglin if born c. MY 120 would be 20 in MY 320, but in
MY 495 would only have grown (495-320)/100 \[life-\]years older = 1.75
or less than 2 \[life-\]years. (He was less than 22 and younger than
Idril: among her reasons for not accepting him.)

This will fit the later narrative fairly well, but will make characters
such as Galadriel and Elrond rather older in the later ages. It however
makes difficulties with Arwen and Aragorn.

Thus Galadriel was just mature, 20 \[life-years\], at the Exile in
\[VY\] 1495. She was therefore 22 on entry into Beleriand and then lived
at a 100 : 1 rate. At the ruin of Beleriand in MY 590 she was therefore
about 28.

Now if Celebrían was born no earlier than SA 300 she was "mature" (20
\[life-years\]) in SA 500. By the end of the Second Age in 3441 she was
then 2,941/100 = 29 \[life-\]years older = 49. By TA 100 (her wedding
with Elrond)[^170] she was therefore 50: not impossible, and explicable
by the troublous times.[^171] If actually born much later, say 850 or
so, she was 20 in \[SA\] 1050 and in TA 100 2,491/100 years older = 45.

But Galadriel would be in SA 300 about 31 \[life-years\] (28 + 3) and in
SA 850 about 36½.

[]{#calibre_link-1622 aria-label="78" role="doc-pagebreak"}If Arwen was
born in TA 341 (as a correction)[^172] she was 20 \[life-years\] in 541.
Therefore when in 2951 she met Aragorn (then 20) she was 20 + 2,410/100
= 44! At her betrothal in 2980 she was 20 + 2,439/100, still about 44.
At the wedding in 3019 she was nearly 45. Aragorn was 20 in 2951, 49 in
2980, and at their wedding 88. But it seems probable that Aragorn's life
was similarly arranged: thus he grew to maturity as quick as the normal
human rate, and then slowed to the Númenórean ageing rate of 3 : 1. He
was thus 20 in 2951; but in 2980, 20 + 29/3 = about 30; at wedding 20 +
68/3 = nearly 43 (and so close in age to Arwen); at death he was 190 =
20 + 170/3 = nearly 77.[^173] On conceiving Eldarion Arwen joined her
husband's rate, and so at Aragorn's death (100 years later) \[45 +\] 34
= 79, an old woman.[^174]

The only way of making Arwen younger at their meeting is this: The
Half-elven lived at the human rate.[^175] Eärendil was only 39 when he
came to Valinor. He was not allowed to return to Middle-earth, but he
obtained the grace (from Eru via Manwë) that his children, being
half-elven on both sides -- descendants of Idril and of Lúthien --
should (a) have a choice of which kindred they would belong to, and (b)
should in each kind have "a long and fair youth" -- sc., should only
slowly reach maturity -- and that this should extend to the second
generation: thus Elrond : Arwen and Elros : Vardamir.[^176]

To Elrond it was thus granted that he should return towards the ancient
growth-rate: he reached maturity at 20 \[life-years\] only in 1,000
\[sun-\]years (rate 50 : 1). He was thus 20 in SA 1000 -- 58 = \[SA\]
942. When sent by Gil-galad to the war in Eregion (SA 1695) he was
therefore 20 + (1695-942)/100 = 27½ \[life-years\], which is suitable.
At the end of the Second Age he was 20 + 25 = 45 \[life-years\] and at
his wedding in TA 100 he was 46, only one year older than Celebrían (see
above), which fits well. Elrond at the end of TA 3021 was thus about 75
\[life-years\], in full Elvish vigour.

If Arwen had the same growth-rate she was born in TA 341 but did not
reach maturity (20 \[life-years\]) until TA 1341. In 2951 she was
therefore 20 + (2,951-1,31)/100 = 20 + 16 = 36 \[life-years\]. In 2980
she was still of much the same age: and Aragorn (by above reckoning) 30.
In 3019 at their wedding she was nearly 37 \[life-years\] (but Aragorn
43). She *then* acquired the life-span of her husband after the birth of
Eldarion in 4A 1. In 4A 100 therefore she was 33 \[Númenórean life\]
years older or 70.

Eldarion was mortal and was not by promise included in the "grace of
Eärendil", but he had in fact a long youth: which took the form of
remaining like a young man from maturity at 20 until 60 without change.
He then lived another 65 years: making him 125, but
[]{#calibre_link-1623 aria-label="79" role="doc-pagebreak"}in life-age
20 + 65 = 85. His descendants became normal, but long-lived
(80--90).[^177]

Elros had the Númenórean scale of life, 3 : 1. But the grace of "long
youth" took the form of doubling this. He thus should have become
"mature" at 60, but in fact became so at 120: he then lived at the
Númenórean rate and died at the age of 500 (*voluntarily* and therefore
not at very great age. He was therefore actually in life-age 20 +
(500-120)/3 = 20 + 127 = 147. Vardamir lived to be 391 and so was little
more than normal Númenórean age (300).[^178] Succeeding kings lived for
about 400 years until Queen Vanimeldë (the 16^th^ ruler): mostly because
after maturity they remained "young" for a long time.

With regard to those born in Aman it might prove useful to increase
their growth-span. Thus the maturing rate of those born in Aman should
be 50 : 1, and this should continue in the second generation (those
begotten in Beleriand or Eriador of one or two Aman-born parents). Thus
Galadriel would not be affected; but Celebrían, born in SA 850, would
not reach 20 \[life-age\] for 50 × 20 = 1,000 \[sun-\]years: i.e., not
until SA 1850. She would then be a young girl at the time of the ruin of
Eregion. In TA 100 she would be only 20 + (3541-1850)/100 = 20 + 17 = 37
\[life-years\]. If born in SA 350 she would be 20 \[life-years\] in 1350
and in TA 100, 20 + (3541-1350)/100 = 20 + 22 = 42 \[life-years\].

Finduilas was about 21 \[life-years\] when Túrin came to Nargothrond in
\[FA\] 490. If she was 12 in VY 1495 (the youngest Exile) she was 14 in
VY 1496. She then needed 6 \[life-\]years for maturity, or as one born
in Aman 6 × 50 = 300 \[sun-\]years. She was thus 20 in MY 300 and in 490
was 5 years older = 25 \[life-years\]. This will not work.[^179]

::: ext
There follows a series of rough attempts, much revised, apparently to
find a chronology that would make Finduilas younger when Túrin comes to
Nargothrond in FA 490[^180]. What appears to be Tolkien's final scheme
appears in the left margin of the last page of this text:
:::

But note \[growth\] rates *doubled* in 1496.[^181] Finduilas (the
youngest Exile) was 12 in 1495. During 1496 she "grew" at a rate of 25
: 1. Therefore in 144/25 years she grew 6 years. She landed in Beleriand
at 16. She then resumed the 50 : 1 growth-rate and needed 4 × 50 -- 4 =
196 \[sun-years\] to complete maturity. She was therefore 20 in MY 196.
In MY 502 she had lived 306 more years at 100 : 1 and so was 23.

::: ext
[]{#calibre_link-1624 aria-label="80" role="doc-pagebreak"}It is unclear
what the significance of First Age 502 is to Finduilas's life. In no
version of *The Annals of Aman* or the *Tale of Years* did Finduilas
survive to FA 502, but rather she died no later than FA 496 (see XI:92).
A possible explanation is provided by some obviously contemporary draft
materials, in which it is said of *Idril* that:
:::

Idril should be rather older \[than Maeglin\]. When Tuor reached
Gondolin in Bel. 495, he (born in 472) was age 23;[^182] but when he
wedded Idril in Bel. 502 he was 30. *Idril should be also about 30 in
Bel. 500*. To be 30 in Bel. 500 *required* 2 \[life-\]years on journey
\[across the Ice from Aman to Middle-earth\], 16 \[life-\]years at
\[growth rate\] 12 : 1 = 192 \[to reach maturity\], and then 12 more
\[life-years\] at 144 : 1.

The journey to Middle-earth \[took\] 144 \[sun-\]years but counted as 2
\[life-\]years: 144 + 192. We still have to alter the arrangement during
the march from Aman in VY 1496. This occupied 144 sun-years; but it was
so horrible that the mature aged at a double rate 2 \[life-\]years
during that time. The immature should also have aged at a double rate,
at 6 \[sun-years\] = 1 \[growth-year\]. Thus an Elda going into exile in
VY 1495 at 12 \[growth-years\] would, by the end of the journey, if
female, only require another 6 \[growth\] years for maturity = 36
\[sun-years\] and would therefore become 18 in SY 36 of VY 1496.[^183]
At the end of VY 1496 and arrival in Beleriand she would have had
another 108 years at the 72 : 1 rate = 1½ \[life-years\] and therefore
be 19½. She would then resume the 144 : 1 rate and in Bel. 502 would be
only 502/144 years older, or about 3½ \[life-years\]. She would be 23.
This fits fairly well. *If we make Idril* 18 at Exile in 1495, she was
then "mature" and lived rest of \[her\] life at 144 : 1 save the year of
journey = 2 \[life-years\]. She was therefore 20 when she arrived in
Beleriand, and in 502 would be 23½. If Idril was 20 at Exile she will be
25½ in Bel. 502. This makes her a little *older* than Maeglin (and still
vastly older in experience) *which is better for the narrative*, *if*
the marriage of Turgon can be rearranged.

::: ext
It would thus seem that Tolkien took the date of Idril's marriage to
Tuor in Bel. 502 here and mistakenly applied it to Finduilas's
chronology.

This is a convenient place to give a further detail found in still
other, very rough but apparently contemporary drafting in red and blue
ball-point pen:

This is a very clear manuscript written in black nib-pen on 16 sides of
eight unlined sheets that Tolkien numbered, in red ball-point pen,
1--14, with two unnumbered sides of tables at the end. These sheets were
then clipped together with a torn half-sheet as a cover/title-page. Some
corrections and highlights were made by Tolkien in red ball-point pen.
It dates to c. 1959.

The text closely follows the beginning of the text presented here as
chap. V, "Natural Youth and Growth of the Quendi", above, until that
text reaches the table of mortal equivalences of Elvish ages.

::: ext
*Concerning the Quendi*

in their mode of life and growth

especially as

*Compared with Men*

I. Youth and Ageing

of the

Quendi
:::

When the Quendi were "young in Arda", during their earliest generations,
before the Great March and especially in the first six generations after
their Awaking, they were far more like Men. Their *hröar* (bodies) were
in great vigour, and dominant; and the delights []{#calibre_link-1628
aria-label="84" role="doc-pagebreak"}of the body of all kinds were their
chief concern.[^184][^185] Their *fëar* ('spirits') were only beginning
to wake fully and to grow in knowledge of their latent powers, and of
their pre-eminence.

Thus, as was indeed at first necessary, and so ordained for them, they
were in their early generations far more concerned with love and the
begetting of children than was so later. Moreover, the engendering of
children was then less costly to their vigour or "youth".

It was not that their natural span of growth and life was different; but
that in their early days they used it differently. The natural life of
the Quendi was to grow quickly (according to their kind) to bodily
maturity, and then to endure in full vigour for many years, until the
motions and desires of their *fëar* became dominant, and their *hröar*
waned.

The Quendian "growth" and "life" may be compared with that of Men, so
long as it is remembered that (a) its rate of "expenditure" was far
slower than the human, especially after achievement of maturity, and (b)
that when the Quendi spoke of their bodies "waning" it did not mean that
these became decrepit or that they felt the oncoming of senility or
death.

The Eldar distinguished between *olmië* and *coivië*. The former was the
period or process of their 'growth' from conception to maturity of body,
and was achieved *twelve times* as rapidly as the *coivië*. This latter
was the process of 'living' or "enduring in Arda", and of acquiring
skill, knowledge, and wisdom.

The *olmië* was achieved at a rate equalling 12 *löar* (or sun-years) to
1 *löa* of human life. An Elvish 'growth-year', or *olmen*, was
therefore 12 sun-years. Thus from conception to birth they grew in the
womb 9 *löar*. When born they continued to grow at this rate until
maturity of body.

The *coivië* then proceeded at a rate 12 times as slow, so that 144
*löar* (or sun-years) may be more or less equated, *so far as change or
alteration are concerned*,[^186][^187] with 1 year of human adult life.
This length of time was the *yén* or Elvish year, or *coimen* as a
measure of age.

Elf-men reached maturity at about 24: that is, after 24 *olmendi* (or
[]{#calibre_link-1629 aria-label="85" role="doc-pagebreak"}2 *yéni*):
288 *löar*. Elf-women reached maturity normally after 18 *olmendi* (or
1½ *yéni*): 216 *löar*.[^188][^189]

After this, their 'youth' (*vinyarë*), or the time of their full bodily
vigour, endured (for both sexes) for about 72 *coimendi* or *yéni* after
maturity. That is: it lasted until Elf-men were of "age" 24 + 72 or 96;
and Elf-women were of "age" 18 + 72 or 90. But expressed in "years" or
*löar* this is 288 + 10,368, or 10,656 years for males; and 216 +
10,368, or 10,584 for females.

The arrival at maturity was recognized at once by individuals, and
occurred with little variation. It was (in times of peace) recognized
also by the Elvish families and communities and honoured with ceremony,
part of which was the announcement of the *essekilmë* or personal
"choice of name".[^190]

But the beginning of the "waning" at the end of youth was hardly
observable, and was also more variable. Its chief mark, indeed, was the
ending of any desire for the begetting or bearing of children (but not
of the physical potency until many years had passed). Its approach and
process was variable for many reasons. It differed naturally according
to the vigour and constitution and character of individuals. Also, among
the Quendi, it was much influenced by begetting and by child-birth.

In this, say the Eldar, more of their "youth" is expended than is the
case with Men; and for Elf-men, they say that each child costs as much
as 1 *coimen* or life-year; but for Elf-women as much as, or more than,
2 *coimendi*. So that for the parents of six children the "waning", or
passing of youth, might come 6 life-years sooner for the father, but for
the mother 12 life-years sooner, or more.

Other special "expenditures", such as grief, long and arduous travel,
great craft-labours, and especially the bodily recovery from grave
wounds and hurts, might also hasten the waning. It is said that the
"dreadful year" (1 *yén*) of the journey of the Exiles from Valinor,
over the Grinding Ice, to Beleriand, affected those of the Ñoldor who
endured it as greatly as *three* normal life-years.

But these "expenditures" are not (as they are not either in reckoning
human ages) taken into account in computing the "age" of any given Elf.
As we may say that two men are both "sixty years old", though one may be
weaker or more worn than the other, so of the []{#calibre_link-1630
aria-label="86" role="doc-pagebreak"}Quendi we may give their ages in
*olmendi* and *coimendi*, and take no account of the chances of their
lives.

As for the begetting and bearing of children: This might naturally begin
as soon as maturity was achieved. So it was in the beginning of the
Quendi; but soon the other commanding interests of their being, as their
*fëar* awoke, began to occupy their thoughts even in earliest youth.
After the first two generations (that is *three* including the First
Elves) the *begetting of children by Elf-men* was postponed beyond the
age of 24, little by little; until soon the age of 48[^191] became the
most usual for the beginning of fatherhood. Later it was often delayed
until the age of 60. It could naturally occur at any time up to the end
of "youth" (at about age 96), but later than this a *first* begetting
seldom occurred.

*In the case of Elf-women*, marriage and child-bearing tended always to
take place earlier than for Elf-men. (For Elf-women were as a rule more
eager for motherhood, and until the "waning" of youth, less distracted
or deeply engrossed in other pursuits of mind or in crafts.) In the
earliest generations their first child was often born before they were
of age 20. Later, indeed, as with Elf-men, the date of the first
child-birth was often delayed; and first child-birth often took place at
age 36.[^192] It could, of course, take place later. In days of trouble
and wandering or of war the producing of children was naturally avoided
or postponed. And since this postponement (especially of the first
child) prolonged the "youth" of the Quendi, child-birth might in such
cases occur up to a female age of 72 (18 *olmendi* + 54 *coimendi*).

These dates -- at any rate in the early Ages with which these ancient
histories are concerned -- were not so much a matter of physical vigour
or potency, as of *will* or *desire*. As soon as they were full-grown,
and with increasing rapidity after the age of 60[^193] in either sex the
*fëa* and its interests began to dominate those of the *hröa*. An Elf
who had not yet become married, or had at least not found a "desired
spouse" by that age (60) was likely, in normal circumstances, to remain
unwedded.[^194]

[]{#calibre_link-1631 aria-label="87" role="doc-pagebreak"}The *number
of children* produced by a married pair was again naturally affected by
the characters (mental and physical) of the persons concerned. But also
by various accidents of life; and by the "age" at which the marriage
began, especially the age of the Elf-woman.

Even in the earliest generations after the Awaking, more than *six*
children was very rare, and the average number soon (as the vigour of
*hröar* and *fëar* began more and more to be applied to other
"expenditures") was reduced to *four*. Six children were never attained
by those wedding after ages 48 for Elf-men and 36 for Elf-women. In the
later Ages (Second and Third) *two* children were usual.

In the early generations the Quendi seem to have arranged their lives
normally so as to have a continuous 'Time of the Children' (or
*Onnalúmë*) until their desires were fulfilled and (as they said) the
generation was complete. This was still often the case with married
pairs later, if they lived in times of peace and could control their own
lives; but it was not always done, and in the later Ages children might
be born after long and irregular intervals.

This often depended upon the circumstances of the parents. For at all
times the Quendi desired to dwell in company with husband or wife during
the bearing of a child, and during its early youth. (For these years
were one of chief joy to them, and longest and dearest held in
memory.)[^195] So that the Quendi did not wed, or if wedded did not
engender children, in troublous times or perils (if these could be
foreseen).

After a child-birth a "time of repose" was always taken, and this again
tended to increase in length.[^196] This time (being concerned mainly
with bodily refreshment) was reckoned in growth-years or *olmendi*. It
was seldom less than one *olmen* (or 12 *löar*); but it might be much
more. And usually (but not necessarily) it was progressively increased
after each birth of a continuous *Onnalúmë*, in such series as: *löar*
12/18/24/30/36 or often 12/24/36/48/60; or in the case of smaller
families: 12/30/48/66. But these series are only averages, or formulated
examples. In practice the intervals were more variable. They normally
occupied some exact number of *löar*, since conception (and therefore
birth 9 *löar* later) was nearly always in Spring; but they were not
necessarily in exact twelves or sixes, nor in regular progression.

A completed "generation" or *Onnalúmë* of *six* children could thus in
theory occupy at *minimum* 114 *löar*. That is 6 × 9 gestations + 5 × 12
[]{#calibre_link-1632 aria-label="88" role="doc-pagebreak"}intervals.
This was naturally rare. At theoretic *maximum* it might occupy the
whole time between maturity of the mother (18) to the end of her "youth"
(90), or 72 *yéni*: i.e., 10,368 *löar*. But this never occurred. So
great an interval (as this average of over 2,060 *löar*) never occurred,
and in cases where large families were engendered the intervals were
seldom greater than 1 *coimen* or 'life-year' (144 *löar*). Six
*coimendi* was in fact the longest interval found in the early
histories; except in Aman where "waning" was retarded, and an interval
of 12 *coimendi* occasionally recorded.

In the early Ages (before the Great March) an *Onnalúmë* of several
children (6, 5, 4) seems usually to have occupied about 1 *coimen*
(equivalent to 1 Valian year or 144 *löar*) from first birth to last
birth: that is, 144 + 9 *löar* from the beginning of the "generation"
with the first conception to the last birth.

The Quendi never "fell" as a race -- not in the sense in which they and
Men themselves believed that the Second Children had "fallen".[^197]
Being "tainted" with the Marring (which affected all the "flesh of Arda"
from which their *hröar* were derived and were nourished),[^198] and
having also come under the Shadow of Melkor before their Finding and
rescue, they could *individually* do wrong. But they *never* (not even
the wrong-doers) rejected Eru, nor worshipped either Melkor or Sauron as
a god -- neither individually or as a whole people. Their lives,
therefore, came under no general curse or diminishment; and their
primeval and natural life-span, as a race, by "doom" co-extensive with
the remainder of the Life of Arda, remained unchanged in all their
varieties.

Of course the Quendi could be terrorized and daunted. In the remote past
before the Finding, or in the Dark Years of the Avari after the
departure of the Eldar, or in the histories of the *Silmarillion*, they
could be deceived; and they could be captured and tormented and
enslaved. Then under force and fear they might do the will of Melkor or
Sauron, and even commit grave wrongs. But they did so as *slaves* who
nonetheless in heart knew and never rejected the truth. (There is no
record of any Elf ever doing more than carrying out Melkor's orders
under fear or compulsion. None ever called him Master, or Lord, or did
any evil act uncommanded to obtain his favour.) Thus, though the
carrying out of evil commands, quite apart from the sufferings of
slavery and torment, clearly exhausted the "youth" and life-vigour of
those unfortunate Elves who came under the power of the Shadow, this
evil and diminishment was *not* heritable.

[]{#calibre_link-1633 aria-label="89" role="doc-pagebreak"}The lives of
the Quendi, also, cannot be supposed to have been affected by living
"under the Sun", in Middle-earth. *As now is known and recognized in the
Histories*, the Sun was part of the original structure of Arda, and not
devised only after the Death of the Trees. The Quendi were, therefore,
designed in nature to dwell in Middle-earth "under the Sun".

The situation in Aman requires some consideration. It appears that in
Aman the Quendi were little affected in their modes of growth (*olmië*)
and life (*coivië*). How was that so? In Aman the Valar maintained all
things in bliss and health, and corporeal living things (such as plants
and beasts) appear to have "aged" or changed no quicker than Arda
itself. A year to them was a Valian Year, but even its passage brought
them no nearer to death -- or not visibly and appreciably: not until the
end of Arda itself would the withering appear. Or so it is said. But it
seems that there was no general "law" of time governing all things in
Aman. Each living thing, individually and not only each kind or variety
of living things, was under the care of the Valar and their attendant
Máyar.[^199] Each was maintained in some form of beauty or use, for the
Valar and for one another. This plant might be allowed to ripen to seed,
and that plant be maintained in blossom.[^200] This beast might walk in
the strength and freedom of its youth, another might find a mate and
bring up its young.[^201]

Now it is possible (though not certain)[^202] that the Valar could have
graced or blessed the Eldar, singly or as a whole, in like manner. But
they did not do so. For, though they had (wisely or not) transported
them to Aman, to save them from Melkor, they knew that they should not
"meddle with the Children", or attempt to change their natures, or
dominate them in any way, or wrest their being (in *hröa* or *fëa*) to
any other mode than that in which Eru had designed them.

The only effect of residence in Aman upon the Eldar seems to have been
this: in the bliss and health of Aman *their bodies remained in vigour*,
and were able to support the great growth in knowledge and ardour of
their spirits without any appreciable waning (except in very special
cases: such as that of Míriel). Those who entered Aman,
[]{#calibre_link-1634 aria-label="90" role="doc-pagebreak"}from without
or by birth, would leave it in the same health and vigour as they had to
begin with.

This slower rate of growth and of ageing natural to the Quendi, as
compared with Men, has nothing to do with the *perception or use of
Time*. This was primarily of the *fëa*, whereas growth and ageing were
of the *hröa*. The Eldar say of themselves (and it may be in some degree
true also of Men) that when "persons" -- in whole being, *fëa* and
*hröa*,[^203] are fully occupied with things that are of deep concern to
their true natures, and are therefore of great interest and delight to
them, Time seems to pass quickly, and not the reverse. That is: the full
and minutely divided employment of Time does not make it seem *longer*
than the same period passed in less activity or in idleness, but
*shorter*. It is not with Time as it might be with a road or path. If
this were closely and minutely inspected it would take long to traverse,
and would maybe seem to be itself of greater length; for that inspection
could only be carried out by slowing the rate of normal travel. But the
*fëa* may quicken its speed of thought and action, and achieve more, or
attend more minutely to events, in one space of time than in another.

Thus the Quendi did not (and do not) *live* slowly, moving ponderously
like tortoises while Time flickers past them and their sluggish limbs
and thoughts! Indeed, they move and think swifter than Men, and achieve
more than any Man in any given length of time. But they have a far
greater native vitality and energy to draw upon, so that it takes, and
will take a very great length of years to expend it.

However, they were from the beginning, and so still remain, close kin of
Men, the Second Children, and their actions, desires, and talents are
akin, as are their modes of perception and thought. They do not think
and act in ways unobservable or actually incomprehensible to Men. To a
Man Elves appear to speak rapidly (but with clarity and precision)
unless they a little retard their speech for Men's sake; to move quickly
and featly, unless in urgency, or much moved, or eager in their work,
when the movement of their hands, for instance, become too swift for
human eyes to follow closely. Only their perception, and their thought
and reasoning, seems normally beyond human rivalry in speed.

This text occupies sides 1--4 and 15--16 (sheets 1--2 and 9, all unlined
paper) of the clipped bundle, in which the other texts are interspersed
between sheets 2 and 9. It is written in black nib-pen in what is a
mostly clear hand, with some rougher alterations and re-arrangements
made subsequently in green ball-point pen.

Of special note in this text is the introduction, or at least
suggestion, of events and motives not previously found elsewhere,
including: the sending of Melian and (at least three of) the later
Istari to Cuiviénen for a time as guardians of the Elves; the doubt of
the younger Elves at Cuiviénen as to the existence of the Valar, and the
prideful sense among these Elves of a "mission" to themselves defeat
Melkor and possess Arda; and of the refusal of the 144 First Elves, "the
Seniors", to depart on the Great March.

                                      (Melkor becomes suspicious, and
                                      guesses war is purposed against
                                      him, because of the Quendi. During
                                      Oromë's absence his emissaries were
                                      busy, and many lies circulate. The
                                      "heresy" awakes in new form: the
                                      Valar clearly do exist; but they
                                      have abandoned Endor: rightly as
                                      the appointed realm of the Quendi.
                                      Now they are becoming jealous, and
                                      wish to control the Quendi as
                                      vassals, and so re-possess
                                      themselves of Endor. Finwë, a
                                      gallant and adventurous young
                                      *quende*, direct descendant of Tata
                                      (therefore 25^th^ gen.), is much
                                      taken by these ideas; less so his
                                      friend Elwë, descendant of Enel.)

  DB 866/13                           2175\. Oromë remains for 12 years,
                                      and then is summoned to return for
                                      the councils and war-preparations.
                                      Manwë has decided that the Quendi
                                      should come to Valinor, but on
                                      urgent advice of Varda, they are
                                      only to be invited, and are to be
                                      given free choice.[^210] The Valar
                                      send five Guardians (great spirits
                                      of the Maiar) -- with Melian (the
                                      only woman, but the chief) these
                                      make six. The others were
                                      *Tarindor* (later Saruman),
                                      *Olórin* (Gandalf), *Hrávandil*
                                      (Radagast), *Palacendo*, and
                                      *Haimenar*.[^211] Tulkas goes back.
                                      Oromë remains in Cuiviénen for 3
                                      more years: VY 866/13--16, FA
                                      2175--8.

  DB 866/14--24                       2176--86. The Valar continue their
                                      war-preparation. (Melkor also.
                                      Angband is strengthened and Sauron
                                      put in command.)

  DB 866/49                           2211\. The preparations and plans
                                      are now nearly complete. The Valar
                                      decide that the Quendi should now
                                      be "invited". But Manwë decrees
                                      that first the Quendi should send
                                      representatives as ambassadors

                                      near to overaweing their free
                                      will.) Oromë is sent back to
                                      Cuiviénen.

  DB 866/50                           2212\. Oromë sets out from
                                      Cuiviénen with the Three
                                      Ambassadors. These were elected by
                                      the Quendi, one from each of their
                                      kindreds. Only the youngest Elves
                                      are willing. Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë
                                      are chosen. (Ingwë belonged to the
                                      24^th^ gen., and was then 140 years
                                      old; Finwë was of the 25^th^ gen.
                                      and 92, Elwë of same and 86.)[^212]

  DB 866/51                           2213\. Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë
                                      arrive in Valinor. They are indeed
                                      dazzled and overawed. Finwë (with
                                      "heretical" leanings) is most
                                      converted, and ardent for
                                      acceptance. (He has a lover,
                                      Míriel, who is devoted to crafts,
                                      and he longs for her to have the
                                      marvellous chance of learning new
                                      skills. Ingwë is already married,
                                      and more cool, but desires to dwell
                                      in the presence of Varda. Elwë
                                      would prefer the "lesser light, and
                                      shadows" of Endor, but will follow
                                      Finwë his friend.)

  DB 866/60                           2222\. They remain 9 years, for
                                      Ingwë and Finwë are reluctant to
                                      hurry away.

  DB 866/61                           2223\. The "Ambassadors" return.
                                      Great Debate of the Quendi. A few
                                      refuse even to attend. Imin, Tata,
                                      and Enel are ill-pleased, and
                                      regard the affair as a revolt on
                                      the part of the youngest Quendi, to
                                      escape their authority. None of the
                                      First Elves (144) accept the
                                      invitation. Hence the Avari called
                                      and still call themselves "the
                                      Seniors".
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

Imin makes a speech, claiming that the "Three Fathers" have authority
(from Eru, since He woke them first), and should decide. Tata says that
each of the Fathers should have authority but only over his own Company.
Enel agrees to this, but makes it clear that he is against the move.
Imin claims to be "Father of All Quendi", but urges that they should at
least in the end all *do the same*, and not break up the Kindred.

The Ambassadors speak. Ingwë speaks with great deference of the Three
Fathers, and especially of Imin. He says it was a mistake that Imin,
Tata, and Enel did not go themselves, for they could have
[]{#calibre_link-1641 aria-label="97" role="doc-pagebreak"}exerted
authority with judgement. But since *they sent* him and his companions
*as their representatives*, they should now (in spite of their youth)
pay great heed to their reports and opinions. He thinks they have no
conception of the riches of beauty[^213] in Valinor. He asks Oromë if it
is still possible for Imin, Tata, and Enel to go to Valinor? Oromë says
"yes, if they will go at once". The Three Fathers are not willing.

Finwë speaks similarly, but lays stress on the riches of knowledge and
crafts in Valinor. Also he says that the Quendi have only seen "the
skirts of the Shadow", and have no idea of its dreadful power, or of the
power of the Valar -- and do not realize what the War (which the Valar
are about to wage on behalf of the Quendi) will entail to Endor. His
speech is very effective, as large numbers of the Quendi who cannot
conceive of Valinor's attraction are nonetheless frightened of what may
befall them if they remain.

Elwë says: "I will go with my friend, but I do not choose for anyone but
myself. Let all my Folk do likewise. I do not see what harm dividing the
Kindred will do -- and it cannot be avoided, unless some are to be
*forced* to do what they do not wish to do (to remain or to go). No
doubt (indeed this is guaranteed) we, or any who wish, will be free to
return to our homes when the War is over". Also he says, "We are a great
company -- the most given to wandering afar. Let many of us at least go
with the safe conduct of the Lord Oromë and see what Endor is like, and
the Sea! We need not pass the shores!" (\[?prophetic\]!). His great
point is the vision of the Sea. This moves the Lindar deeply.

::: ext
At this point, apparently dissatisfied with the absence of the Three
Fathers from the ambassadorship to Valinor, Tolkien proposes a new
scheme:
:::

Alternative. Let Imin, Tata, and Enel be the Ambassadors, and take with
them as "representatives" of the Younger Elves Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë.

Of the Three Fathers Imin and Tata are both impressed by Valinor and
desire at least to live there for some time. (Imin loves the beauty and
Tata the wisdom of the Valar and their works.) Enel is less moved: there
is less "space" in Valinor, and he missed the great heavens, and
unexplored lands, and the freedom of plants and beasts.

Imin claims to be the 'Father of All Quendi' (*Ilquendatar*) and to have
right of decision. Tata will have it that each has authority only
[]{#calibre_link-1642 aria-label="98" role="doc-pagebreak"}over his own
Company; Enel that no one should be overruled to go or stay against
his/her will. He proposes that first they should decide by vote of all
adults what is the general wish, or which is the majority. Imin says
that will inevitably divide the Folk. Tata says that is inevitable
anyway without force. Imin says "but how can those decide *by vote* who
have not seen the choice?" They must rely on their ambassadors. There
then is a clamour for the "young assistants" to speak.

Ingwë speaks with deference of the Three Fathers. His feelings are much
the same as Imin's. He was filled with the memory of the beauty of
Varda. He makes a moving speech of the loveliness of her and all her
works.

Finwë (more rebellious and independent?) speaks with less deference,
hinting that even Tata did not employ his time as fully as might be, and
has not depicted aright the wealth of the Valar in wisdom and skills, of
which a long sojourn could master only a small part. (He has undisclosed
thoughts of the enhancement of his lover Míriel's skill.) But his most
effective point is (see above) in frightening the Quendi by revealing
the power of Melkor and the Valar and the probable ruin of the War in
Endor.

Elwë as above -- He \[?treats\] Enel for a free vote and emphasizes
freedom of return.

Imin reluctantly agrees to a vote. Not all are present, but about 2/3
are in favour of acceptance, and the Quendi sit long in silence. The
stars come out and they are reluctant to go. Dawn comes and many are
eager to start. As day wears on they vote: ¾ will go. The stars come out
again and many change their minds.[^214]

  872/48           Oromë and Tulkas are needed for the War.

New Scheme
:::

*Old Scheme*. "Days of Bliss" last \[VY\] 1--1050 before "Awaking" =
10,500 \[sun-\]years.[^217] Not long enough. Let "DB" be longer, and
Elvish Events packed at end. The intrusion from outside into the
"artificial" world of the Valar soon destroys it!

*New*. The Trees flower for 864 VY before Awaking = 124,416
\[sun-\]years. Quendi then awake in Spring of \[VY\] 865 (124,417
\[YS\]).[^218] "DB" still goes on, but Quendi start reckoning of *First
Age* with Awaking.

First Age must last *somewhat longer* than SA (= 3,441). Still be more
regularly "duodecimal" (as mythological) up to Death of Trees and after!
Say, 4,056 years.

Death of Trees is 24 VY (= 3,456 \[YS\]) after Awaking = VY 888. First
Age should then occupy 4,032 years = 28 VY. That is 3,456 (Death of
Trees) + 576 \[sun-\]years (= 4 VY). But actually war last\[s until\]
600? So FA = 4,056 \[YS\] = 28\[VY +\]/24\[YS\].

Quendi therefore enter Valinor sometime after VY 864. After VY 864 all
dates should be given in \[sun-\]years (as well as VY). Found 864
\[sun-\]years after awaking = 6 VY. VY 870. (About 12 VY elapse before
all settled in Valinor. VY 876.)

::: ext
The text ends here, about three-fourths down the page. Tolkien
subsequently made some alterations to dates in green ball-point pen,
changing the year of the Awaking again, to 850, and writing against this
change: "Quendi Found in 864"; then changing the relative date of the
Death of the Trees to 24 VY after the "Finding"; and finally changing
the date at which the Quendi enter Valinor to "after VY 850". Tolkien
however did not make the further adjustments to the rest of the text
that would be needed to harmonize it with these changes (e.g.,
recalculating the number of sun-years elapsed at the Awaking in VY 850),
so I have left the original figures and wording to stand above. But
since the date of []{#calibre_link-1645 aria-label="101"
role="doc-pagebreak"}the Awaking arising here by final alteration, VY
850, appears *ab initio* in text 1 above, it is evident that these two
texts, 2a and 2b, are successive preliminary drafts for the much more
expansive text 1.

On the verso of this last sheet are, again, somewhat rougher notes and
calculations, mostly in pencil. Of chief note are the two statements
Tolkien wrote in black ink in narrow-nib pen, the first at the top of
the page:
:::

Time in Valinor must be given in Sun-years (*löar*). In old scheme Trees
lasted from VY 1--1495 = nearly 1495 × 10 \[sun-\]years = 14,950 *löar*.
This period is too short.

The second is in the top margin (with which cf. the element in text 1,
whereby both Melian and the Istari were sent to the Elves at Cuiviénen
as Guardians):
:::

that it evidently precedes the text presented here as chap. XVI, "Note

T[EXT]{.small1} 1

::: ext
*Calculation* of the Increase of the Quendi

from the *Awaking* to the *Beginning of the Great March*[^220]
:::

*First Elves*. Awoke at *maturity*. Population 144. Began at once to
engender the second generation. This, therefore, with the first births
will begin to appear in VY 1000/9. It will take VY 1/90[^221] years to
[]{#calibre_link-1649 aria-label="105" role="doc-pagebreak"}complete
(i.e. up to date of last births). All 72 pairs of "destined spouses"
wed, and the average family is 6 per pair. In VY 1001/90, therefore, the
*increase* will be 72 × 6 = 432. Population 576.

After this various things that modify this first process must be
considered:

\(a\) The age at which the new generations begin to beget children will
slowly increase by 6 *coimendi* (= 6 VY) *on an average*, until 48 is
reached, which will then remain the average age for a very long time:
*First Elves* at maturity (24): *2^nd^ gen.* at 30; *3^rd^ gen.* at 36;
*4^th^ gen.* at 42; *5^th^ gen.* (and many later generations) at 48.

\(b\) The length of time in which a generation is completed, sc. *the
average intervals between births*, also increases, while becoming (in
cases considered individually) more variable. But probably *an average
time* for the completion of a generation (from *first begetting* to
*latest birth*) for the completing of all generations after the First
until the Eldar reach Valinor may be set at 2 VY = 288 *löar*.[^222] ☞
This will be irrespective of the actual average number of children
produced in each family, since as this number falls, the intervals
between births also rise.[^223] (This average of VY 2 = 288 *löar*
reckons from *the first begetting* to the *last birth*. The period would
probably be for 6 children: 294 *löar*; for 5: 285; for 4: 288; for 3:
287; averaging at 288.5.)[^224]

\(c\) *Average production of children* per pair or family also decreases
from 6 by 1^st^, 2^nd^, and 3^rd^ generations, to 5 by the 4^th^ gen.,
to 4 by the 5^th^ gen., to 3 thereafter in the 6^th^ gen. and subsequent
generations (at least up to arrival in Valinor).[^225]

\(d\) After the engendering by the First Elves of the 2^nd^ gen. the
proportion of males and females varied, not being equal
[]{#calibre_link-1650 aria-label="106" role="doc-pagebreak"}(though
remaining always near to an equal division). Thus not all could find
spouses; already a few did not desire marriage; and there were various
ill-chances and losses (especially after Sauron discovered the Quendi).
The wedded pairs therefore cannot be found by dividing the numbers of
each generation by 2. A proportion, beginning with 1% of the 2^nd^ gen.,
and increasing (by 1%) in each following generation until 10% is
reached, must be deducted from the complete 100s before division by 2.

If these factors are taken into account, it is possible to calculate,
with fair accuracy, the *increase* of the Quendi from the date of their
*Awaking* until their *Finding* by Oromë 90 VY later, or any other date
decided upon.[^226]

::: section-symbol-break-page-end
![Table Image](images/000012.jpg){.calibre24}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*see note [^227]*

The number of the Quendi therefore at about 106 Valian years after their
Awaking would have been about 57,500.

[]{#calibre_link-1651 aria-label="107" role="doc-pagebreak"}But if Oromë
arrived in VY 1090 that would be *before the first births* of the 7^th^
gen.; and the *youngest* of the 6^th^ gen. would be VY 90 -- VY 77/126,
or nearly 12 VY "old" = Elf-men VY 2 = 24 + VY 10 = 10 = 34; Elf-women
VY 1½ = 18 + VY 10½ = 10½ = 28½. They would all be fully mature and
marriageable, and though the beginning of the 7^th^ gen. would in
undisturbed circumstances have probably been delayed for another 4 VY
(or nearly so) the change of life might alter that.

Also note that the *eldest* *men* of the 6^th^ gen. would already be
over age 43, while the *youngest* women would be over 28 and past the
ordinary marrying age. So that from at least the 6^th^ gen. (or indeed
the 5^th^ gen.) we have to reckon with marriages *within a generation*
and the loss of an unmixed sequence.[^228]

*On the above calculation*: if there were a total of 32,414 Quendi at
the end of the 6^th^ gen., this would be the total population when Oromë
found them in (say) VY 1090 (90 VY later): the youngest would then be
"30" in age.

The "Companies" should be still in approximate proportion of 14⁄144,
56⁄144, and 74⁄144. If we take the actual total to be 32,400, these
proportions would be exactly 3,150, 12,600, and 16,650. But many of the
Quendi will become Avari. Say 1/3 of total = 10,800. The *Marchers* or
Eldar then will number 21,600. 1⁄72 of this is 300. Therefore the Vanyar
will be 2,100; the Ñoldor 8,400; and the Lindar 11,100.

This suffices (barely?). There will probably be increase on the March,
and greater increase in Valinor(?). But *more* would be better. \**And
the time required is far too great*. 90 VY = 12,960 \[sun-\]years: this
is much too long for the Quendi to be left unguarded and at the mercy of
Melkor and Sauron!! (In the original scheme only 85 × 10 = 850 years was
allowed.)[^229]

*But* if the time is reduced, the rate of increase must be very greatly
raised. The Quendi in their first few generations before the March (or
reaching Valinor) must -- as is quite reasonable -- be made far more
eager for love and the begetting and bearing of children. \**They must
have larger families, at shorter intervals between births.*

The *Valian Years of the Trees* should be duodecimal. Let VY 1728 be the
*death of the Trees*. In the older scheme about 400 VY = 4,000 years
covered events from the *Finding* to the *Darkening of Valinor*. But
Elves now live at a rate 14 times or more as slow. We can allow about
48,000 years, or on present scheme about 3331/3 VY. Say 336 (or 12 × 28)
= 48,384 *löar*. (Or 324 = 12 × 27 = 46,656 *löar*).

[]{#calibre_link-1652 aria-label="108" role="doc-pagebreak"}In that case
the Finding should take place about 1728 -- 336 = 1392. The Awaking
should take place not more than 6 VY (= 864 years) previously, that is
in VY 1386. (The entry into Valinor could be later by 12 VY -- later
allowing for a long sojourn of Oromë and negotiations, and for delays on
the March -- or perhaps better only 6 VY: sc. early VY 1404 or 1398.) In
these 6 VY the Quendi must increase to over 30,000 from 144.

Let the *First Elves* *awake* in VY 1386 (with the Finding in 1392).

Between VY 1386 and 1388/94, all 72 pairs wed and (at once) produce 12
children each = 72 × 12 = 864. Population = 1,008.

Between VY 1386/9 (first births) + VY 2 (maturity) = 1388/9 and
1388/84 + 2 VY + VY 2/84 = 1393/24, 430 (not 432) pairs wed and produce
12 children each = 5,160.[^230] Population = 5,738.[^231]

Between VY 1388/9 + 2 VY = 1390/9 and VY 1393/24 + VY 2 + VY 2/84 =
1397/108, 2,500 pairs (not 2,580) and produce 12 children each = 30,000.
Population = 35,738.

About this time the Great March begins.

It is not necessary to have quite so many as 35,738 Quendi, and their
generation need not be quite so prolific and precipitate![^232]

Elves awake VY 1386. Population 144.

The First Elves at once beget children and in their joy and vigour begin
at once and beget 12 each pair on average: 12 × 72 = 864. These the
first births will take place therefore in 1386/9 and the last after VY
1/96 years. 12 gestations of 9 years (= 108) + 11 intervals of 12 years
(= 132) = 240 = VY 1/96. 1387/96. Population = 1,008.

2^nd^ gen. First born 1386/9. Last born 1387/96. First births 1386/9 +
VY 2 (maturity) + 9 = 1388/18. Last births 1387/96 + VY 2 + VY2/18 =
1391/114. (VY 2/18 represents rise of interval to 18 years.)[^233] 430
pairs × 11 = 4,730. Population = 5,738.

3^rd^ gen. First born 1388/18 + VY 2 + 9 = 1390/27. Last born 1391/114 +
VY 2 + VY2/84 = 1395/198 (VY 2/84 represents rise of interval to 24
years.)[^234] 2,350 pairs × 10 = 23,500. Population = 29,238.

4^th^ gen. First born 1390/27 + VY 3 + 9 = 1393/36. Last born 1396/54 +
VY 3 + VY 2/84 = 1401/138. 11,500 pairs × 9 = 103,500. Population
132,738.[^235]

There remains a curious final scheme -- final in the sense that it is
now on the recto of the last sheet in this small bundle -- but that is
in no sense continuous with or a development of the second of the two
schemes presented above. In fact, it shares the chronological starting
point of the first of those schemes, in which the Quendi awake in VY
1000 and the 2nd generation begins to appear in VY 1000/9, and so
conceptually precedes the second scheme, in which the Quendi awake in VY
1386.

As mentioned in the editorial notes, the verso of this last sheet
appears to be draft material for the first scheme presented above;
moreover, the first line of that first scheme echoes the final line of
that draft material. It might be thought then that this scheme is
continuous with that drafting: i.e., that it is in fact the first and
earliest of the schemes in this bundle. But if so, it adheres less
strictly to the contents of that drafting than does the first scheme
presented above, in that the intervals between birth and next gestation
don't begin to increase until the 5th gen., and neither is there a
percentage reduction in wedded pairs until the 5th gen. (where it is 5%,
as it is in the 6th gen.).

I cannot therefore with assurance place this scheme chronologically with
respect to the preceding schemes. Nonetheless, since Tolkien both
retained the sheet and did not strike its recto through, I present it
here in its bundle-order.

Thus: the Quendi awake in VY 1000. Number 144. The 2^nd^ gen. appears in
VY 1000/9.

*First Elves*. Start with 144. First births: FA 10, 31, 52, 73, 94, 115,
136, 157, 178, 199, 220, 241; each produce 72. 2^nd^ gen. 72 × 12 = 864.
240 years from first begetting in year 1 to last birth in 241.

*Second Elves*: born in 12 groups of 72 each between FA 10 and 241. Of
these 36 pairs in each group only an average of 35 pairs wed = 420
pairs: each produce 11 = 4,620. The first group, born at 10, will beget
at maturity, 288 = FA 298, and their first births will follow in 307;
the second group, born in 31, will beget in 319 (births in 328).

The Third Elves will therefore begin to appear in 307. Since Second
Elves only produce 11 children, each pair will have an *Onnalúmë* of 219
years (11 × 9 = 99 + 10 × 12 = 120). The *last births* will therefore be
from those born in 241 and mature in 529, sc. in 529 + 219 = FA 748.

Thus there will be 4,620 persons born between 307 and 748.

*Third Elves*: born in 22 groups of varying content, two groups (born
307 and 748) of 35 each, two (328 and 727) of 70 each, and so on. There
will obviously already be marriages outside groups and so on. But the
average will probably be fairly closely found if 34 is substituted for
35, making two groups of 34, two of 68, etc. Total wedded pairs = 4,488.
These produce 10 children each. The 4^th^ gen. therefore = 44,880.

144 + 864 + 4,620 = 5,628. But the 4^th^ gen. began to appear in 604.
Its first four groups = 3,400 had appeared. Of the subsequent groups to

population at the arrival of Oromë therefore was 5,628 older Elves
(youngest 116 years old = age 98⁄12) + 14,960 young Elves (eldest 260 =
age 215⁄12, youngest = 8 years = 8⁄12 or 8 months) = 20,588. (This
number will be greatly increased in immediately following years.)

After this the average number of children varies. 3 remains frequent
(but 2 is also frequent) but the interval varies from 84 to 144.

*Note*: There was *never* any objection at any time to marriage outside
the "generations": in fact it soon becomes inevitable and necessary
(though the Quendi always *know* their ancestry and place in the descent
from the Three First Elves). *Also*, the Quendi were all one people, and
though "the Companies" soon began to dwell and house separately (hence
they were called *olië* 'people together' and *ombari* 'dwellers
together') there was never any objection to marriage between members of
different companies. Though these were naturally not frequent (more
common among the leaders and chief []{#calibre_link-1661
aria-label="118" role="doc-pagebreak"}families). They did not upset the
"average" calculations. The *Company of Imin* (*Imillië*) were always
more separate (rather proud of being the Eldest), and relations between
the *Tatalië* and *Enellië* were closer. It was arranged -- for Imin,
Tata, and Enel said men \[i.e., Elvish males\] awoke first, and began
the families -- that when any woman married one of another Company, she
was reckoned to have joined the Company of her husband. The exchange was
about equal and does not affect calculations materially. For the same
reason, *descent of authority* was reckoned from the immediate father;
but women were in no way considered less or unequal, and Quendian
genealogy traced both lines of descent with care.[]{#calibre_link-1662

This text occupies two sides of an unlined sheet, and is written in
black ink with a narrow nib-pen. It dates from c. 1959.

In appearance and content it is closely related to the initial schemes
of the text presented in the next chapter, and probably closely precedes
those, since they uniformly exhibit a gestational period of one sun-year
for Elves, whereas prior to this text the period was 9 sun-years.
:::

All the elaborate calculations based on *olmië* 12 : 1 and *coivië* 144
: 1 are both cumbrous, and in *early narrative* (Awaking and Finding,
March, etc.) quite unworkable. Also *unlikely*. The difference between
Elves and Men is mainly in *longevity* after becoming full-grown: this
depends mainly again on the difference in powers of Elvish and Human
*fëar*. As far as *hröar* go Elves are "of the flesh of Arda" and quite
unlikely to grow at a rate wholly out of keeping with the rest of
corporeal or incarnate creatures.

The Elvishness should therefore only appear when their *hröar* reach
*prime* (adult) and then do not *for a very long time* show any
diminishment of physical youth and vigour. (This will help with
Maeglin!)[^239]

Elves should grow *from conception* at a rate comparable to Human; but
from maturity onward should slow to 144 : 1 rate, diminution appearing
(almost imperceptibly at first) at c. age 96.

Let Elves *remain in the womb* for 1 *löa*, Spring to Spring. *Both
sexes* []{#calibre_link-1664 aria-label="121" role="doc-pagebreak"}reach
maturity at 24 *löar*, and then slow. But *puberty* is different: in
males reached at about 21, in females at 18. *Nowadays before* \[?*these
ages*\].[^240] The First Elves awoke at 21/18. Weddings were immediate.
Later weddings in "Early Years" (before the March) usually at 24/21--24.

*Olmendi* \['growth-years'\]: 1 *olmen* = 1 *löa*.

*Coimendi* \['life-years'\]: 1 *coimen* = 144 *löar*

*Colbanavië* \['gestation'\] = 1 *olmen*

*Ontavalië* 'puberty': male 21 *olmendi*, female 18 *olmendi*.

*Quantolië* 'maturity': 24 *olmendi*

*Vinimetta*: 'end of youth': 96 = 24 *löar* + 72 *coimendi* = 24 +
10,368 = 10,392.

This complex of texts, which were pinned together by Tolkien, dates like
most of the "Time and Ageing" file from c. 1959, as indicated by the
engagement calendar pages for May, June, and August used for some of
them. I characterize the individual texts below.

Note that throughout the gestation period is 1 *löa*, as is the length
of a growth-year.

T[EXT]{.small1} 1

::: ext
The first text is written in a (mostly) clear hand in black ink with a
narrow-nib pen, on the backs of two engagement calendar pages for 24--30
May and 31 May--6 June, 1959, respectively; with a few later changes and
additions in pencil.
:::

*First Elves*. Awoke at *ontavalië* \['puberty'\] (\[males\]
21/\[females\] 18).[^241] But they did not turn to marriage until
maturity of the elf-man (24), the elf-woman then being 21. These ages
were ever after held the earliest *suitable* ages for marriage, though
elf-women were sometimes married earlier. (As soon as they were 18 they
were sought in betrothal -- a period which, whenever entered, usually
lasted 3 years.)[^242] But *marriage* could take place at any time
before the "waning of the *hröa*" -- the cessation of \[?sexual\] desire
was a mark of its approach.[^243] It was, however, naturally seldom
entered into after the "End of Youth" -- c. age 60 (= \[growth\]
year\[s\] 24 + *coimendi* 36 []{#calibre_link-1666 aria-label="123"
role="doc-pagebreak"}= 24 + 5,184 = c. 5,208);[^244][^245] and births
after this age are seldom recorded. The *later* the marriage the *fewer*
the children.

In the "Early Years", especially before the March, the Quendi tended to
concentrate on the *Onnalúmë*, and produce their children in a (for
them) quick series, and then satisfied to turn to other things. But this
only happened in the days of peace and serenity.

The first two generations of Elves in their vigour are recorded to have
produced 6 children for each wedded pair.[^246] In all succeeding of
"Early Years" generations the *average* declined to 4 at 3^rd^ gen., 2¾
at 4^th^ gen., 1⅚ at at 5^th^.[^247]

The intervals between births were at all times very variable; but
naturally more regular in early times and in any times of peace (as in
Valinor). Even when children were produced long after *maturity*
(*quantolië*) the interval was governed by growth-years or *löar*, since
it was governed by *physical recuperation* (\[?*increasing*\]).

The Quendi aver that more vigour (or as they say "of their youth") is
used in the production of a child, than is so among Men; at the same
time they are far more vigorous in "youth" and especially before age 48
(3,480 years),[^248] and their bodies recuperate far swifter and more
completely from strains or hurt. The minimum "rest" was 3 *löar* (or 3
times the bearing),[^249] depending chiefly on the woman: it was seldom
reduced, and often much increased. In later generations it was often
much lengthened -- naturally in the days of war, exile, and troubles. It
might be extended to 2 *coimendi*, or in some cases 3 or even 4.[^250]

In larger families the "interval" tended to increase after each birth.
This interval was reckoned from birth to begetting of the next
child.[^251] In the early years the *Onnalúmë*, reckoned from \[first\]
begetting to last birth, averaged at about 108 \[sun-\]years: 8
intervals of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 = 108; + 9 \[for\]
gestation\[s\] = 117 \[sun-years\].[^252]

The recto of the next sheet (of unlined paper) in the first bundle
begins a new text, in black ink in broader nib-pen, with one addition in
green ball-point pen.
:::

All this business makes the "remote" legend of origins too recent. In
spite of all difficulties I think the Elves must awake *much longer*
[]{#calibre_link-1667 aria-label="124" role="doc-pagebreak"}before the
Finding, and *therefore* their *propagation* should be *slower*, and
their *marriages* *later*.

If the Trees are destroyed in VY 888, that allows 127,872 *löar* for the
"Bliss of Valinor"! If the Awaking were c. 800, say VY 792 (12 × 66),
then 96 VY would elapse before the Death of the Trees = 13,824. But the
Finding should be not till VY 864 = 72 VY \[later\] = 10,368 *löar*,
leaving 24 VY for the March and the Sojourn of the Ñoldor \[in Valinor\]
= 3,456 \[sun-years\].[^253]

How long before should the Quendi "awake"? Quendi *awake* VY 850 (*löar*
122,400); *found* VY 864 (*löar* 124,416). 2,016 \[sun-years\] elapse =
14 VY. Only 216 \[sun-\]years (12 × 18) or 1½ VY elapse before the
March.

The First Age begins with the Awaking and ends with the Downfall of
Angband. In the Older Scheme the March is about FA 1080.[^254] Here it
would be about 2016 + 216 = FA 2232 (or 15½ VY after the Awaking). The
Embassy set out 20 years before the Great March = 2212.[^255]

T[EXT]{.small1} 3

::: ext
This text is a gathered series of seven generational schemes, all but
the first labelled and numbered as such. The first two schemes are
written in a clear hand in black ink with a narrow-nib pen (the same pen
and in the same hand as that employed in text 1 above) and later pencil
additions, on the back of engagement calendar pages for 2--8 and 9--15
Aug. 1959, respectively. The remaining five schemes are written in black
ink with a broader nib-pen, with additions and corrections made
variously in pencil and green or red ball-point pen.

While all exhibit, in the date of the first births after each wave of
weddings, a gestational period of 1 *löa*, and share VY 864 as date of
the Awaking, these successive schemes exhibit considerable variation in
the date of the beginning of the Great March, ranging from VY 878 (FA
2016) to VY 1070. This variability of course provides Tolkien with
flexibility in balancing Elvish rates of increase with a desired
population size at the March.

In the year of the Finding (FA 864) the total population of Quendi
therefore was 16,280 (or less allowing for losses) of the first 5
generations. But the 6^th^ gen. was appearing: first births FA 849
(second births FA 934, third FA 1043). We must therefore add 3,330,
making a total of 19,610, or over 19,000.

At the March the whole of the 6th gen. had appeared: add again 2 × 3,330
= 6,660, total 26,270. The 7th gen. was not due to appear until FA 1234
(= FA 849 + age of marriage 384 + 1). The 6^th^ gen. was the *end* of
the "Early Years". The Age of Marriage tended thereafter to increase
towards "Age 48" = 24 \[sun-\]years + 24 *coimendi* = 24 + 3,456 = 3,480
\[sun-years\] and often reached "\[Age\] 60" = 24 \[sun-years\] + 36
\[*coimendi*\] = 5,208 \[sun-years\].

The Average of Children became 2. The percentage of non-pairs rose to
10% by degrees. But in Valinor non-pairs dropped to 1%, the average age
of marriage was 36, and the average number of children 6. The Noldor
thus increased greatly. But since Quendi did not bear children if
possible in war and exile there were few births in []{#calibre_link-1669
aria-label="126" role="doc-pagebreak"}Beleriand, thus the average number
of children was ½ per pair, and the unwed pairs rose to 30%; so that the
Eldar barely replaced losses.

the first births of the 6^th^ gen. = 6,970. Total population at the
Finding (excluding losses) is 27,322 + 6,970 = 34,292. At the March the

What is now the verso of the sheet on[]{#calibre_link-1671
aria-label="128" role="doc-pagebreak"} which Scheme 3 was written
contains a text that, despite being written with the same broader
nib-pen as is Scheme 3, agrees with Scheme 2 against Scheme 3 in its
details, and moreover specifically references "Scheme 2" in a marginal
note; and so I give it here instead:
:::

Let Ingwë, Finwë, Elwë all be young 6^th^ gen. Elves, but each a direct
descendant (by eldest son) of Imin, Tata, and Enel \[respectively\].
(Divergence in dates of birth is due to intrusion of earlier-born
daughters.)

Ingwë was in the first births of the 6^th^ gen. The earliest births of
this generation were in FA 536. Let Ingwë be born in 536: 328
\[sun-years old\] at the Finding in FA 864, 534 at the March in FA 1070.
The 6^th^ gen. married at \[sun-year age\] 312. Therefore Ingwë married
in FA 848 (just before the Finding). At the March he had three children,
born in FA 849, 934, and 1031. The youngest was 39 at the March.

Finwë must have been a later 6^th^-generation birth. Let Finwë be born
in FA 772: 92 at the Finding, 298 at the March. He would have married
about FA 1084. He already loved Míriel and postponed marriage till the
end of the March.

Elwë was born in FA 792: 72 at the Finding, 278 at the March. He
[]{#calibre_link-1672 aria-label="129" role="doc-pagebreak"}would have
been married about FA 1108, but had not yet set his heart on any spouse.

When Oromë asked for Ambassadors, Imin, Tata, and Enel were against the
whole business, and refused to go. Ingwë was the eldest son of Ilion,
who was in a direct line from Iminyë in the 4^th^ generation (all having
been first children and sons); sc. great-great grandson: he was tall,
beautiful, beloved by the *Imillië*, more given to thought than the
arts. His spouse was Ilwen (born FA 539). His first child was a son,
Ingwil, his second a daughter Indis (born FA 934).[^256]

::: ext
In addition, a small bundle of sheets placed after the seven schemes
presented here, but obviously preceding scheme 3, has notes making
reference and comparison to the preceding two schemes, written for the
most part in the same pen and hand as those schemes, and that motivate
certain features seen in the subsequent schemes, and so I give them here
as well:
:::

*With Scheme 1*: Total population at the time of the March would be
26,270. If we say 26,244, allowing for losses and/or miscalculation,
then: Avari were recorded as being 1/3 of total. Avari therefore 8,748,
Eldar 17,496. Now, the original division was 14/144, 56/144, and 74/144.

Imillië (Vanyar) should have 7/72, Tatalië (Ñoldor) should have 28/72,
Enellië (Lindar) should have 37/72. 17,496/72 = 243 therefore Vanyar =
1,701, Ñoldor = 6,804, Lindar = 8,991; say Vanyar = 1,700, Ñoldor =
6,800, Lindar = 8,900; total = 17,400

This allows for the loss of the other 96, or inaccurate division. It is
just barely sufficient.

*With Scheme 2*: Total population at the time of the March would be
48,232 (excluding losses). Avari 1/3 = 16,077, Eldar = 32,154. If we say
the total is 48,168 (allowing for 64 future losses), then Avari =
16,056, Eldar = 32,112.

32,112/72 = 446 therefore Vanyar = 3,122, Ñoldor = 12,488, Lindar =
16,502; say Vanyar = 3,100, Ñoldor = 12,400, Lindar = 16,500; total =
32,000.

This allows a future 122 loss. Losses before March will be 64 + 56 + 112
= 232.

[]{#calibre_link-1673 aria-label="130" role="doc-pagebreak"}Taking the
Great March to have begun c. 1070, the oldest Quendi would then have
been 1,070 years old = 24 + 1,046/144 (= 7 VY/38) or 31 plus 38 *löar*.
The youngest 1070 -- 1031 (third births of the 6^th^ gen.) = 39 years:
i.e., 24 and 15 *löar*. None would be old at all; and divergence between
the Eldar and Avari could not much have depended on *age* as such. But
the eldest of the two elder generations (1, 2) would have lived near
Cuiviénen for 1,070 to 1,041 *years*; thus all those born up to FA 300
would have lived then 770 years and more (sc. all gens. 1, 2; first 4
births of gen. 3).

Those who had lived over 600 years at Cuiviénen (sc. were born in or
before 470) were:

:::

In Scheme 1 therefore none born after 470 but a few, 660, need go.

In Scheme 2, 1,210 beyond the first births of gen. 6 must go.

But this is a purely abstract calculation. All 1^st^ gen. married at the
same time. Therefore in FA 189 all of the 2^nd^ gen. -- 432 -- was
complete. But they were born at *different times*; sc. about:

The table ends here, incomplete; but following the scheme through, there

progress, so that \[?\] generations would not keep intact. Plainly a
child could be born in practically *any year* between 4 and 864 or 1070.

Quendi awake in DB 850, spring = FA 1 spring. Elves awake at

them in DB 864 = FA 2016. The March begins in spring 216 \[sun-\]years
later = FA 2232. There are therefore 2,016 years for propagation.

Let the First Elves, 144, all wed at 24 (men) and produce 4 children in
an *onnalúmë* of 24-year intervals = 4 + 3 × 24 = 76 years.

marriage rates (from about 98% to about 99%), thus resulting in a higher
rate of increase in population (and a total in the 29th generation of
30,522 vs. the original total of 23,640). I give here the final version
with all emendations adopted.

On the verso of the first sheet of Scheme 7, Tolkien wrote (in black
nib-pen):
:::

If this Scheme is accepted: At the Great March in FA 2232, some of
Generations 25--30 would not yet be born. Of gen. 25, probably 16 births
would have occurred from 1488 to c. 2223 (intervals 49);[^265] of gen.
26 some 12 births from 1609 to c. 2214 (intervals 55); of gen. 27 some
10 births from 1730 to c. 2225 (int. 55); of gen. 28 some 7 births from
1851 to c. 2181 (int. 55); of gen. 29 some 5 births from 1984 to 2228
(int. 61); of gen. 30 some 2 births from 2117 to 2278 (int. 61). It is
not possible to tell how many "birth groups" there were, or how many on
average in each; but taking 18 as the average number: then of gen. 25,
16/18 were born; of gen. 26, 12/18; of gen. 27, 10/18; of gen. 28, 7/18;
of gen. 29, 5/18; of gen. 30, 2/18. These proportions of yield in each
generation added to the population of gen. 24 (24,436) make a population
of between 27,000 and 28,000. Allowing for *losses* (in perils before
the Finding), 27,000 should be a safe estimate. This will make: Avari =
9,000, Eldar = 18,000. Therefore, since 172 of 18,000 is 250, at the
March, Vanyar were 7/72 = 1,750; Ñoldor 7,000; and Lindar 9,250. These
are very suitable numbers.

When do Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë come in? If born before the Finding in FA
2016, they should be then adult, and at least 24: sc.
[]{#calibre_link-1686 aria-label="143" role="doc-pagebreak"}born no
later than 1992. Now, this is the date of the last birth of gen. 23; but
only gen. 30 is excluded (1992 could be among earliest births of gen.
29). But an Elf born in 1992 would be 240 \[sun-\]years old at the
March, at which time the marriage age was 120; but it is important that
neither Finwë nor Elwë should be married. So far in tentative schemes,
the Embassy was less than 100 years after the Finding (sc. now before
2116, c. 2110). The three ambassadors should be *young*, *adventurous*,
but direct descendants or "heirs" of Imin, Tata, and Enel; but they must
be at least about 24 (or older!) at the time of their going to Valinor.
If born in (say) 2086, they would be 146 at the March -- still too old.
The Embassy must be later, not more than 20 years before the March,
allowing 10 years of absence and 10 years of preparation: say 2212. Let
Ingwë be born in 2072; Finwë in 2120 (48 years later); and Elwë in 2126.
Then at the Embassy Ingwë would be 140, Finwë 92, and Elwë 86. At the
beginning of the March Ingwë would be 160, Finwë 112, and Elwë 106.
Ingwë married about 2072 + 108 = FA 2180; his first child (Indis) was
born in 2181 (so 51 at the March), his second in 2230, just before the
March. Míriel, also in the 25^th^ gen., was born about 2130?

::: ext
A marginal note partly in broad nib-pen and partly in green ball-point
pen reads:
:::

Finwë and Elwë were friends, very adventurous. Olwë, born 2185, was 27
at the Embassy, 47 at the March (Elmo was born on the March). All three
were direct descendants or heirs of the Three First Elves and regarded
as chieftains.

Ingwë was 24^th^ gen., his children therefore 25^th^. Finwë was gen. 25,
Elwë gen. 25.

Elvish Ages

& Númenórean[^267]
:::

Elves' ages must be counted in two different stages: growth-years (GY)
and life-years (LY). The GYs were relatively swift and in Middle-earth =
3 *löar*. The LYs were very slow and in Middle-earth = 144 *löar*.

[]{#calibre_link-1691 aria-label="148" role="doc-pagebreak"}Elves were
*in womb* 1 GY. They reached "full speech" and intelligence in 2 GY.
They reached "full growth" of body in 24 GY.[^268]

They then had 48 LY of youth, and then 48 LY of "full age" or "steadfast
body",[^269] by which time their knowledge ceased to increase. After
that the "fading time" began -- of unknown duration (very slow) in which
(as they say) the *fëa* slowly consumed the *hröa* until it became
merely a "memory".

If we neglect the difference of speed and call each unit a "year", we
then see that an elf[^270] reached maturity at 24, end of "youth" at 72,
and "old age" at 120.

In mortal equivalents the *age* in physical and other characteristics
indicated can be found approximately by multiplying by ¾: "full speech"
in 18 months, full growth in 18 years, end of youth approximately at 54,
and old age approximately at 90.

The Elves thus (in their own scale) were grown up swiftly. They reached
"full speech" in 18 months and physical maturity in 18 years. In *actual
time*, however, reckoned in *löar* (Sun-years) the figures are these:

::: ext
In womb: 3 years.

"Full speech" at 6 years old.

Full growth at 72 years old

Years of youth lasted 48 × 144 *löar* = 6,912 years

"Maturity" or standstill was not therefore reached till they were 6,984
years old.[^271]

"Fading" began at 13,896 years old.
:::

Thus after 72 years an Elf could be reckoned equal to an 18-year-old
Mortal. But he was not 19 years old till he had lived for 216 years. In
the "course" of the Second Age the elves (if of full growth when it
began) aged only at the equivalent of a little less than 23 years (or in
mortal equivalent less than 18). In the course of the Third Age they
aged less than 21 years (or in mortal equivalent about 15).

[]{#calibre_link-1692 aria-label="149" role="doc-pagebreak"}The "resting
time" for women[^272] after childbirth was, however, reckoned in GY
units: it was seldom less than 1 (= 3 sun-years), usually 2 (= 6
sun-years).^7^ An indefinite period could, however, elapse between
births, depending only on the length of "youth". In times of peace the
Elves usually set apart a *bearing-time* and then had no more children.

It may be noted that Elven women did not in fact usually bear children
(never a first child) as late as 72 "end of youth" (mortal equivalent
54). The latest date for a first (and usually last) child was mortal
equivalent 48 = 64 elf life-years.[^273]

::: ext
Examples of application to Narrative
:::

*Galadriel* was born in Aman: "young and eager" at the beginning of the
Exile; not yet full-grown: say 20. The March \[back to Middle-earth\]
took a whole life-year of the survivors at whatever rate they were
living, sc. to the young \[but\] "grown" it added 1 growth-year (3
*löar*); to the older and full-grown 1 life-year (144 *löar*). Therefore
Galadriel was 21 when she reached Middle-earth. She became full-grown
therefore (24) in 9 *löar* after arrival. By the end of the First Age --
the overthrow of Thangorodrim and the ruin of Beleriand -- she had added
(600-9LY)/144 = approximately 4 LY. She was thus about 28 (or in mortal
equivalent aged 21). Early in the Second Age she married Celeborn, and
dwelt first in Lindon. In TA 1 she had added 23 years and was 51 (mortal
equivalent 38). In TA 3021, when she sailed West, she was about 51 + 21
= 72 (mortal equivalent 54) and had just passed her "youth" and entered
"maturity". *This fits well.*

*Celeborn* was older than Galadriel. It is difficult to be sure of any
person whose origin goes far back into the First Age. Celeborn was in
the 2^nd^ generation of the three Elf-kings that led the March: he was
by tradition the son of a younger (2^nd^) brother of Elwë (Thingol),
called Elmo.[^274] But the relative ages of the Kings Ingwë, Finwë, and
[]{#calibre_link-1693 aria-label="150" role="doc-pagebreak"}Elwë is not
known. Elmo *probably* was much younger than Finwë. Galadriel was of the
3^rd^ generation, being the daughter of Finarphin (4^th^ child), the son
of Finwë (5^th^ child). However, Galadriel was young at the Exile
(which, whatever scale of ageing is assumed for the Elves while dwelling
in Aman, means relatively near to the end of the Days of Bliss, and to
the Exile). According to Elvish calculations, the period between the
arrival of the Eldar in Aman and the end of the First Age in the
Overthrow of Morgoth, was 3,100 *löar*. If that is correct,[^275] then
Celeborn was of unknown age when he entered Beleriand, but certainly 24
and full-grown, added in 3,100 *löar* nearly 21 life-years and was
45[^276] at the end of the First Age. He married Galadriel shortly after
when she was 28 (21 \[mortal equivalent\]). In TA 3021, when bereft of
Galadriel he was 68 + 21 = 89 (66+ \[mortal equivalent\]) and advanced
in "maturity".

*Celebrían* was born in Lindon at least 1 GY (3 *löar*) after the
beginning of the Second Age; but probably (according to Elvish custom) 3
GY or 9 *löar*: say SA 9. Celebrían will be therefore full-grown (24 =
18) in SA 81 (9 + 72). When she weds Elrond (if the date is correct) she
will have added life-years (3,441-81+100)/144 = 3,460/144 = 24 and will
be 48. Her marriage was delayed by the wars against Sauron.

But if (as seems a probable tale) Amroth was the son of Celeborn:[^277]
the following calculation is possible.[^278] Celeborn and Galadriel were
not married (though betrothed) during the dreadful years of the "Battle
of Wrath", nor for some while afterwards in the confusions of the Second
Age (i.e., not till SA 24).[^279] Amroth their first child was born in
SA 33: he was full-grown in SA 105, and at the founding of Eregion (SA
750) he was nearly 4½ years older: 29. At the time of the sack of
Eregion (1697) he was 35. At the end of the Second Age he was 47+ (47⅙).
At the time of the disaster in Moria, and the loss of Nimrodel, TA 1981,
he was 60--61: nearing the end of youth, but (in mortal years) about 45.
This is possible. The story was probably that Nimrodel would not give
her love to the incoming non-Silvan elves, and hid herself in the
mountains, not wishing to "go West".

In that case Celebrían could be younger? She was born in Lindon (say) SA
45, and was full-grown in SA 117. She would then be at wedding
(3,441-117+100)/144 (= exactly 24) + 24 = 48.[^280] Evidently this shift
of 37 years makes insignificant difference. In TA 2510 \[her departure
[]{#calibre_link-1694 aria-label="151" role="doc-pagebreak"}from
Middle-earth\] she would be 48 + 2,510/144 (= 17½) = 65 (mortal
equivalent 49).

The marriage would however be suitable since Celebrían would be 48
(mortal equivalent = 36) and Elrond (see next) nearly 57 (mortal
equivalent = nearly 43). Mortal equivalent 36 was a frequent age in the
troublous times for an Elven woman to bear a child.[^281]

*Elrond*. The "Half-elven" should age slower than ordinary Men, before
the "doom" of the Valar was spoken.[^282] Probably at rate of 1 to 5 as
for Elros, the only one who lived his life out as Half-elven. (Full
growth being achieved at Elvish rate of 24 but reckoned in normal
*löar*.)

Elrond was present (see LR I 256)[^283] at the fall of Thangorodrim.
Eärendil his father wedded Elwing in FA 525,[^284] being then 23.
Elrond[^285] may have been born about 527--530. He was thus at least 70
at the fall of Thangorodrim in c. FA 600.[^286] But this would be the
\[mortal\] equivalent of 24 + 46/5 = approximately 33.

He was made Elven soon after, and would then slow down to the Elvish
rate of 144 SY = 1 life-year. In SA 3441 he would be 56. In TA 100 he
would be nearly 57, but still in youth (= mortal equivalent nearly 43).

The dates of Elrond's wedding (as in LR III 366) and of the births of
his children are perfectly possible, but not likely.[^287] For the
present (Aug. 15, 1965) they are left unchanged, since they cannot be
fixed until a decision is taken about the story of Celeborn and
Galadriel, and their connexion with Lórien.[^288]

The best story seems to be that outlined under "Galadriel",[^289] in
which they take part in the settlement of Eregion, and later of its
defence against Sauron. But another possibility is that hinted at in the
proposed emendations to the "Tale of Years" (LR III 366), by which they
did not come to Lórien till TA 1060.[^290] ☞ NB: alterations of the
dates of Elves (including Elrond) only affects their lives at a rate of
about 8 months = 100 years!

*The case of Arwen*. Taking her birth as TA 241, she will then be
"full-grown" in TA 313 (241 + 72). In 2951, when she first meets
Aragorn, she will be (in Elven Growth- and Life-years) 24 + 18⅓
[]{#calibre_link-1695 aria-label="152" role="doc-pagebreak"}(nearly);
(2,951-313)/144 = 42⅓ = mortal equivalent 31¾. Aragorn was only 20.

In 3019, when they were married, she would have aged very little and
would be nearly Elvish 43 (24 + (3,019-313)/144) = mortal equivalent
32--3. But Aragorn would have lived 88 years and 4 months. His "age"
would however be about "45". (See the note below on the Númenórean
life-scale.)

At marriage Arwen became "mortal": she would then join her husband's
scale of "expectation of life". ☞ This would not alter her "age" of 43 =
approximate mortal equivalent 32--3. But for the purpose of reckoning
her expectation of life (as a mortal), she would count as having lived
81 years (24 + (19 × 3)), and her further "permitted life" would be
about 153 years (to total 234). She might have lived on to about Fourth
Age 151. Aragorn as 88 at wedding would have a permitted life of 146
more years and could have lived to about 4A 144. When Aragorn "resigned
life" in 4A 120 he thus resigned 24 years of life. He had lived 210
years and was already within his "decline".[^291] Arwen was reckoned as
203 years at that time and also in the beginning of her decline. Aragorn
resigned on the day of his birth, March 1, 4A 120. Arwen apparently
"resigned" life and died on Cerin Amroth on March 1 in the following
year, at Númenórean age 204 (mortal equivalent = 84). *So she was now
and felt*. (Had she remained Elvish she would have been only 3,020 --
241 + 1 + 120 = 2,800 Sun-years old, giving an Elvish age of (24 +
2,800-72)/144 = almost exactly 43 (mortal equivalent about 33).

The Númenörean scale fixed by the Valar (for other than Elros) was for a
life in full (if not "resigned" earlier) of thrice that of ordinary men.
This was reckoned so: A "Númenórean" reached "full-growth" at 24 (as
with Elves; but this was for them reckoned in Sun-years); after that, 70
× 3 = 210 years were "permitted" = total 234. But decline set in (at
first slow) at the 210^th^ year (from birth); so that a Númenórean had
an expectation of 186 fully active years after reaching physical
maturity.

The Elvish lives should go in *cycles*. They achieved longevity by a
series of *renewals*. After birth and coming to *maturity* and beginning
to *show age*, they began a period of *quiet* in which when possible
they "retired" for a while, and issued from it renewed again in physical
health to approximately the vigour of early maturity. (Their knowledge
and wisdom were however progressively *cumulative*.)

This had not appeared in the periods dealt with (or had only begun
towards the end of the Third Age).

The "Fading" was apparent in this way:

::: ext
[]{#calibre_link-1699 aria-label="156" role="doc-pagebreak"}1) The
periods of activity and full vigour became progressively shorter, and

2\) The *renewal* was not so complete: they were a little older at each
renewal than at the previous renewal.

T[EXT]{.small1} 2

This text was written increasingly hastily in soft pencil on the versos

March of 1970.
:::

Elves lived in life-cycles? sc. birth, childhood to bodily and mental
maturity (as swift as that of Men) and then a period of *parenthood*
(marriage, etc.) which could be delayed for a long time after
maturity.[^292] This "cycle" proceeded until *all* children of the
"first period of parenthood" were grown up. Then there was a
youth-renewing.

Elves married *in perpetuity* and as long as a first mate was alive and
incarnate they had no thought of other marriage. In Aman the only case
of a breach was Míriel/Finwë. In Middle-earth, especially in the Elder
Days, violent death was frequent; but the slain (\[?etc.\]) could by the
Valar be restored to life.[^293][^294] At their *own* choice. The Valar
became more \[?gentle\] in this matter -- and the griefs of the Eldar
were often so great before death that being unwilling to return was held
pardonable -- especially to those having no wife or ungrown children.
(Only in one known case, Beren, did the Valar -- by special permission
of Eru -- restore a human body to life and suffer its *fëa* to return.)
If a wife was left widowed (or vice versa) forever remarriage was
permissible, but seldom occurred.

In lives not marred by death or who enter \[it\] the "youth-renewing"
left the pair young and vigorous, but for awhile *though they dwelt
together* they went about their own businesses and \[?recovered\] in
\[?\] before a second period of parenthood arose. (Some never entered
such a new period.) But, though it was long before it was noticed, at
each new "cycle" their vigour of the Eldar waned a little. Before the
end of the Second Age youth-renewals and the re-Generation of
[]{#calibre_link-1700 aria-label="157" role="doc-pagebreak"}children
were becoming rare.[^295] The Eldar were "fading": whether this was by
the original design of Eru, or a "punishment" for the sins of the Eldar,
is not certain. But their "immortality" within the Life of the World was
guaranteed, and they could depart to the Blessed Realm if they willed.

:::

Any (mortal) creature (sc. things appearing inside Eä) in Valinor during
the Trees would have aged only with the rate of 1/144 of its *natural*
Middle-earth speed (save only the Quendi who were immortal). At the
awaking of the Quendi this proportion 1/144 (with regard especially to
Men) was natural, and those that came speedily to Aman maintained this.
But in spite of "immortality" (within Arda) the ageing of Arda soon
affected those who remained in Middle-earth: quickest those who refused
the Summons. But the Eldar who remained (or the Sindar) were soon
reduced to a rate of 1/100 more or less and that proportion can be used
in reckoning the "relative []{#calibre_link-1702 aria-label="159"
role="doc-pagebreak"}age" of Elves in the Silmarillion. For High Elves
it probably remained more or less so until the end of the Third Age and
then, for those remaining in Middle-earth, it quickened rapidly.

It must be considered that (disregarding actual length of the time
scale) Quendi were similar to Men in these respects: though they *began*
quicker they soon slowed down, and reached maturity about 20. Their
normal marriage time was therefore approximately between 20 and 60. But
in earlier times, before the end of the Third Age, while they were still
*physically* vigorous, unlike Men, they *could* postpone the
marriageable state. Normally they only had *one* period of
child-begetting and bearing lasting 20--40 years or more after marriage.
But if they did not *use* this power at the normal time it could be
postponed till they were 100 or a little more.

But it must then be considered that in earliest times and in Aman always
that meant a "year" was in fact the *yên* or 144 years (and even later,
after the Death of the Trees, was 100 years). So that an Elf in earlier
times or in Aman matured in mortal terms when about 2,880 years old, and
could bring forth children up to the age 8,660, or an exceptional one
14,400. In later times these ages reduced to 2,000, 6,000, and 10,000.

::: ext
At some point Tolkien struck through all the above text, but
specifically retained the following:
:::

Elves should awake about VY 1050 and reach Beleriand c. 1450 = 400 VY =
after 57,600 years. Their West-march began about 1445 and took 144 × 5
MY = 720 years.[^296]

Men awake in VY 1500 and reach Beleriand in 1531 = 31 VY × 144 = 4,464
years. (Too little!)

Men must awake *before* Melkor is taken to Valinor, or *after* his
escape. In the former case it must be about VY 1050, in the latter much
more time must be devised between the Return of Melkor and the arrival
of Men in Beleriand.[^297] Fleeing Aman, crossing the Ice, sojourn in
Arvalin could take a \[?great while\].[^298]

If Men awake in 1050, Elves must awake earlier.[^299]

Time in Lórien? See explanation in LR vol. I but adjusted except for
Elves. Probably mortals entering had \[?their\] growth-rate and ageing
altered, not to the Elvish rate but much slowed, say to 1 : 7: so the
[]{#calibre_link-1703 aria-label="160" role="doc-pagebreak"}true 30/28
days seemed about 4. Then downstream for a short while.[^300]

These rates and calculations are concerned only with growth and ageing,
and *not* with the perception or *appreciation* of time as subjectively
long or short (except in so far as such perception may be affected by
ageing, etc).

The question of "perception of Time" is more difficult to deal with,
since it varies with persons, circumstances, and kinds of persons, and
it is difficult also to express or communicate, so that when the Eldar
conversed with the Atani on such matters neither side was sure that they
understood the other's clearly. And again the *fëar* of Elves and of Men
are not corporeal or subject \[?actually\] to Time, and \[are\] able to
move in it in thought and retrospect and so can have divergent views of
the subjective length of one and the same time or experience. They may
say of \[?such\] it fleeted by and yet it seemed to endure for ages.

These things however, so far as the Eldar are concerned, seem specially
to influence time-perception and/or its recollection. On one side youth
(inexperience, vigour) and eagerness; on the other age (experience,
failing vigour), dullness. And secondly, *full occupation* in delight,
affection, or mutual interest; and on the other side *lack of
occupation*, or mutual interest, and absence of delight or a presence of
distaste or pain.

The "length of time" that is attributed to *Youth* as against Age is
probably chiefly one of *hope* and *expectation*, \[?allowed\] to
inexperience. A child's afternoon seems a boundless vista -- but this is
chiefly in \[?thought\] or before it is spent. If it is fully of
"occupation" it \[?will race by soon\] like a flash, and teatime will
come before anything but a beginning of the \[?plan\] is achieved.

The old look forward with hard experience -- an afternoon they know will
not suffice for much achievement. It seems brief in prospect (as it
proves), but whether it *actually during the experiencing of it* seems
any briefer than the same actual period in childhood (spent in about the
same amount of occupation) may be much doubted.

In Age to Men (and Elves) years seem to go swiftly they say, but that is
for various reasons, some really of "reasoning" rather than feeling.
They go "swiftly" because of experience: (1) as few new things or none
are encountered, there is little to \[?save\] in a memory already
\[?stocked\]. (The mind is also duller and hardly notes the present.)
(2) there is all the same *no desire to come to the end*, or rather
*desire not to do so*; the time therefore seems to stop though
\[?hands\] []{#calibre_link-1704 aria-label="161"
role="doc-pagebreak"}are unable to stay it. As if two travellers went
along the same road: the one has never journeyed there before, and he is
young and full of hope, maybe eager to reach the end and enter upon
other roads; the other has travelled the same way many, many times, and
barely notes the things seen or passed, and he is tired maybe, and yet
fears to reach the end, having little hope of going on to further
journey. To which will that road seem shorter? To the young \[?halting
(at least in light and??\]) barely at all \[?\] and yet not
\[?hoarding\] the \[?moments\] it may seem a long and memorable journey
in experience and in retrospect. To the older it will hold little of
memory to distinguish it from other journeys like it, and yet its end
will come too soon. It will seem swift, at least in retrospect.

The older also will in *retrospect* retain the feeling of \[?experience
here???\]. As when an old man wonders at the short time in which a babe
is born and grows up to run. For this occurs now while \[?his mind\] is
\[?\] and the days go by quickly, but such things he remembers occurring
earlier in his life (or his own childhood) and they *seemed longer*. But
he knows they were not.[^301] Therefore he says *now* the time seems
short in which they occur!

## [NOTES ON ELVISH TIME-REFERENCE](#calibre_link-411){.toc-link} {#notes-on-elvish-time-reference .chapter-title1}

::: ext
The following texts are all derived, not from the "Time and Ageing"
file, but rather from Tolkien's late (c. 1968) writings on his invented
languages. This seems a convenient place to share Tolkien's further
thoughts on the Elvish perspective on time.
:::

T[EXT]{.small1} 1

::: ext
*Elvish time.*
:::

Our language is confused, using *after* or *before* both (in certain
circumstances) of the future. We sometimes think and speak of the future
as what lies before us, we look *ahead*, are *pro-vident*,
forward-looking, yet our ancestors *preceded* us and are our
*fore*-fathers; and any event in time is *before* one that is later. We
speak as if events and the succession of human lives were an endless
column moving forward into the unknown, and those born later are behind
us, will *follow* us; yet also as if though facing the future we were
walking backwards or being driven backwards, and our children and heirs
(*post*erity!) were ahead of us and will in each generation go further
forwards into the future than we. A widow is a *relict*, one left
behind, by a husband who goes on.[^302]

As far as a single experiencing mind goes, it seems a most natural
transference of spatial or linear language to say that the past is
*behind* []{#calibre_link-1706 aria-label="163" role="doc-pagebreak"}it,
and that it *advances* forward into the future; that later events are
*before* or in *front* of earlier ones. At the point when the individual
ceases the survivors go on further ahead of him. All living creatures
are in one mass or column marching on, and falling out individually
while others go on. Those who do so are *left behind*. Our ancestors,
who fell out earlier, are further behind, behind us for ever.

In Elvish sentiment the *future* was not one of hope or desire, but a
decay and retrogression from former bliss and power. Though inevitably
it lay *ahead*, as of one on a journey, "looking forward" did not imply
anticipation of delight. "I look forward to seeing you again" did not
mean or imply "I wish to see you again, and since that is arranged
and/or very likely, I am pleased." It meant simply "I expect to see you
again with the certainty of foresight (in some circumstances), or regard
that as very probable" -- it might be with fear or dislike,
"foreboding". Their position, as of latter-day sentiment, was as of
exiles driven forward (against their will), who were in mind or actual
posture ever looking backward.

But in actual language time and place had distinct expressions.

T[EXT]{.small1} 2

The Eldar regarded all that was *past* as behind them, their faces being
*towards* the future. With reference to time therefore words with a
basic sense "behind, at the back" = "before"; and those originally
meaning "in front, ahead" = "after".

Nonetheless in thinking of people and the generations they spoke as if
the elders were leaders marching at the head of a line of *followers*.
It thus became difficult to speak of "those behind" = "peoples of former
days" being followed by later generations. *But* such terms as *leading*
and *following* were to them *pictorial* analogies, only used with a
definite transfer of sense: as if we were to speak of *looking back*
into the dark mists of days *before* our time.

For ordinary purposes, e.g., as what happened before my time, "*behind*"
was used, at least originally. In practice, Common Eldarin had developed
four distinct prepositional or adverbial bases:

::: space
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------
  A. (1) before of time   \(2\) behind of place
  B. (1) after of time    \(2\) in front of, ahead of place
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1707 .calibre3 aria-label="164"
role="doc-pagebreak"}T[EXT]{.small1} 3

::: ext
Time reference
:::

The Eldar spoke of people and generations as if the picture before their
minds was of a line on the march with the elders *leading* ahead and the
later-born *following*. This was no doubt due to the fact that the
elder-born so frequently remained among them. It coloured all their
speaking of time. They usually imagined themselves *looking*
\[?*inwardly*\] to what has been, that is they *found* the past (and do
not call it "looking back") and had their backs to the future and would
not call anticipation of it "looking ahead" but "looking back" as
looking over the shoulder.

::: ext
Tolkien struck through this text, and began again:
:::

The Eldar did *not* use a linear-space picture of the time relation,
unless they were deliberately constructing an analogical *picture*. That
is, they conceived the relation of precedence or consequence in *time*
as something different from preceding or following in space.

Of course they could, speaking of a long experience as a journey, as if
passing from one year to another were like going from one place to
another (though the much decreased speed of time-apprehension??? was
envisioned made this much less usual than with us). Or they could speak
of older people as if they were at the *head* of the march, and the
later-born as *following*: this was a fairly common "figure of speech",
but was much more a *figure* than with us. They did not call elders
*ancestors* = preceders.

For one thing (as they said) in space one can turn and look in many
directions; in *time* one's position is fixed. Hence the two groups
confused in our language were *distinct*:

::: space
  -------------------------------- ---------------------------------
  A. (1) before, earlier of time   \(2\) before, in front of place
  B. (1) after, later of time      \(2\) after, behind of place
  -------------------------------- ---------------------------------

## [A FRAGMENT FROM *THE GREY ANNALS*](#calibre_link-419){.toc-link} {#a-fragment-from-the-grey-annals .chapter-title1}

::: ext
For reasons that eluded even Christopher Tolkien, a fragment of what
appears to be drafting for the *Grey Annals* (subsequently struck
through) came to be collected into the "Time & Ageing" bundle. For the
most part it is similar to the account given at XI:55 (and more so after
numerous pencil emendations), but there are many differences in detail,
and it features an otherwise unpublished poetic version of Fingolfin's
challenge of Morgoth to battle before the gates of Angband (itself
clearly deriving from *The Lay of Leithian* ll. 3552--57, III:285); and
so I give the fragment here in full.
:::

... \[all that beheld\] his onset fled in amaze, deeming that Oromë
himself was come, for a great madness of ire was upon him. Thus he came
alone even to Angband's gate and smote upon it once again, and sounded a
challenge upon his silver horn, calling upon Morgoth to come forth to
combat, crying:

::: ext
"Come forth, thou coward lurking lord

to fight with thine own hand and sword!

Thou wielder of hosts of slaves and thrall,

pit-dweller, shielded by strong walls,

thou foe of gods and elven-race,

come forth and show thy craven face!

thou coward king, and fight with thine own hand! Thou den-dweller,
wielder of thralls, liar and lurker. Come foe of Gods and Elves, for I
would see thy craven face!"[^308]

Then Morgoth came. For he could not refuse such a challenge before all
his folk and captains. But Fingolfin was not daunted by him,[^309]
though he towered above the Elven-king like a shadow of thunder or a
storm above a lonely tree, and his vast black unblazoned shield was like
a thundercloud that drowns the stars.[^310] Long they fought, and Ringil
pierced Morgoth with seven wounds, and his cries were heard in all the
northlands.[^311] But wearied at last Fingolfin was beaten to the earth
by the great hammer that Morgoth wielded as a mace,[^312] and Morgoth
set his foot upon his neck and crushed him.[^313] In his last throe the
Elven-king pinned the foot of his Enemy to the ground with Ringil, and
the black blood gushed forth.[^314][]{#calibre_link-1711

As seen in part one, and further in various texts published in
*Morgoth's Ring* (see especially X:217--25), by the late 1950s Tolkien
had become greatly interested in the nature and relationship of spirits
(in Quenya *föar*) and bodies (Q. *hrëar*) in incarnates -- that is,
beings like Men and Elves that are by nature a union of a material body
and a created, immaterial soul. As will be seen herein, consideration of
bodies and spirits, and the closely related matter of minds, continued
into the last years of Tolkien's life, and ran in both metaphysical and
mundane directions: from the nature of being and identity, the relation
of free will to divine foreknowledge, thought-communication, and the
manner and mode of Elvish reincarnation; to the finger-games of Elvish
children, and the question of which races and characters did or did not
have beards.

It will further be seen that the metaphysics of Middle-earth as
reflected here is firmly Catholic: that is, it is clearly informed by
the metaphysics espoused by St. Thomas Aquinas (itself deeply influenced
by Aristotle's metaphysics), which enjoyed a dramatic reaffirmation by
the Catholic Church during Tolkien's youth, under Pope Leo XIII (who
reigned 1878--1903). As Tolkien famously said, "*The Lord of the Rings*
is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work" (L:172), a
statement that has puzzled many critics, because both *The Lord of the
Rings* and Tolkien's wider *legendarium* are all but devoid of
references to any religious *cultus* (let alone a Catholic system of
rites and worship). As I hope the texts presented here will show, the
key word in Tolkien's statement, often ignored as simply emphatic, is
*fundamentally*: that is, in its foundations, in its essential nature.
In these particular texts, this is most clearly seen in Tolkien's
implied commitment to *hylomorphism*: that is, the
Aristotelean-Thomistic teaching that all material []{#calibre_link-1715
aria-label="173" role="doc-pagebreak"}things are ultimately a union of
created but undifferentiated *prime matter* (in Quenya, *erma*) with a
God-given *form* (in Tolkien's parlance here, *pattern*, that which
gives each portion of *erma* the nature and shape of the thing that it
is). It is also reflected in the commitment to the belief that
everything, even Morgoth himself, was as created *good*, but that due to
the free will possessed by every creature with a rational mind, they
could fall: as one Vala and various Maiar, and Men corporately, did; and
that even Manwë, had he asserted his own will and judgement over Eru's,
would likewise have fallen. Further discussion of these and similar
matters is provided for the interested reader in App. I.[^315]

This text comprises a selection from etymological notes by Tolkien, made

√*ban*. (related to √*man*?) This appears originally to have referred
simply to 'beauty' -- but with implication that it was due to *lack of
fault*, or *blemish.* Thus Q *Arda Vanya* 'Arda Unmarred', *Arda Úvana*
= Arda Marred*. ilvanya*, *ilvana* 'perfect'.

\[Derivatives:\] Q *Vána*, name of Valië, the most perfectly 'beautiful'
in form and feature (also 'holy' but not august or sublime),
representing the natural unmarred perfection of form in living things.
*vanya*, beautiful, unmarred, of fair unspoiled form, &c. *vanima* (only
of living things, especially Elves or Men) 'beautiful'. *úvano*,
*úvanimo*, a monster, corrupt or evil creature. S *bân* or *bain*, fair,
good, wholesome, favourable, *not* dangerous, evil or hostile.

√*man* 'good'. This implies that a person/thing is (relatively or
absolutely) "unmarred": that is in Elvish thought unaffected by the
disorders introduced into Arda by Morgoth: and therefore is true to its
nature and function.[^316] If applied to mind/spirit it is more or less
equivalent to morally good; but applied to *bodies* it naturally refers
to *health* and to absence of *distortions*, *damages*, *blemishes*,
etc.

Derivatives: \**Ámān*: Q *Aman* (*aman-*), S *Avon* 'Unmarred State',
especially applied to the "unmarred" western regions, of which *Valinor*
(abode of the Valar) was part. *Manwë* Quenya name of the "Elder King",
Lord of the Valar of *Aman*. *māna*, any good or fortunate thing;
[]{#calibre_link-849 aria-label="175" role="doc-pagebreak"}a boon or
"blessing", a *grace* (being especially used of some thing/person/event
that helps or amends an evil or difficulty). (Cf. a frequent ejaculation
on receiving aid in trouble: *yé mána (ma)* = 'what a blessing, what a
good thing!') *manya-* 'to bless' (sc. either to afford grace or help or
to wish it).

*Gender and Sex*
:::

The Elvish languages did not distinguish grammatically between male
(masculine) and female (feminine). Thus *se* meant 'he' or 'she'. But
there was a distinction made between *animate* and *inanimate*.
*Animates* included not only rational creatures ("speaking people"), but
all things living and reproducing their kind. To these were applied the
pronouns such as *se* 'he/she'. *Inanimates* included not only all
physical objects recognized or thought of as distinct things, such as
"river, mountain", or substances such as metal, stone, gold, but also
parts of bodies or living shapes whether dead, or thought of as
analysable parts or organs of a living whole: such as *leg*, *eye*,
*ear*, *hand*, *arm*, *head*, *horn*, *flesh*, *blood*, *flower*,
*seed*, *root*, *stem*, *tentacle*, *skin*, *leather*, *hair*, etc. It
also included all grammatical abstracts such as *thought*, *act*,
*deed*, *colour*, *shape*, *feeling*, *sight*, *mood*, *time*, *place*,
*force*, *strength*, etc.

NB: It did not include *mind*, or *spirit* when thought or spoken of as
an integral thing, and attributed to a rational creature. There were
several words in Quenya that bore those senses, but those regarded as
only functions or operations of the individual "mind-soul" went with all
other "abstracts" into the inanimate class. The organs of the body, such
as "heart" were never used for or as the "seat" of thought, wisdom,
feeling, or emotion; but this may have been due to later
[]{#calibre_link-1718 aria-label="177" role="doc-pagebreak"}thought and
analysis. The physical organ 'heart' had the base \**khom* (Q. *hón*,
*hom*) and this was not in recorded Quenya used of feelings; but an
ancient derivative \**khomdō* (Q. *hondo*) was often used as the (seat
of the) deepest feelings, such as pity or hate parallel to \**ōre*
'innermost mind', and region of deep thought, where also inspiration or
"guidance" was received.[^317] In *The Lord of the Rings* this was
translated 'heart', as in "my heart tells me", etc. Cf. Treebeard's
adjective applied to Orcs, *sincahonda* 'flint-hearted'.[^318] *hondo*
was probably influenced in formation by \**indō* (probably \< \**im-dō*
'self, innermost being' (taken as referring to the centre of "reason"),
very similar to \**ōre*. (\**ōre* was not related to √OR*/*RO 'up,
rise', but was from √GOR 'deep, profound', seen in Q. *orda* 'profound';
cf. S. *gorð* 'deep thought', *gúria* 'ponder'.)

In phrases such as: "A's mind was wise/good, it seldom erred", *it*
would be *se* (animate), and it would not matter to the sense if this
was translated 'he' and taken to refer to A.

The Words for *Hand*
:::

The Eldar regarded the hand as of great personal importance, second only
to the head and face. Common Eldarin had a number of
[]{#calibre_link-1720 aria-label="179" role="doc-pagebreak"}words for
this part of the body. The oldest (probably) and the one that retained a
general and unspecialized sense -- referring to the entire hand
(including wrist) in any attitude or function, had probably the
primitive Common Eldarin form \**maȝa*, a stem proper to the sense
'hand' and having no other meaning. It may have been related (though
this is naturally merely conjectural) to C.E. MAGA, a stem meaning
'good' -- but without moral reference, except by implication: sc. it was
not the opposite of 'evil, wicked' but of 'bad (damaged, imperfect,
unfit, useless)', and the adjectival stem derived, \**magrā*, meant
'good for a purpose or function, as required or desired, useful, proper,
fit'.

Common Eldarin had a base KWAR 'press together, squeeze, wring'. A
derivative was \**kwāră*: Q. *quár*, T. *pār*, S. *paur*. This may be
translated 'fist', though its chief use was in reference to the tightly
closed hand as in using an implement or a craft-tool rather than to the
'fist' as used in punching. Cf. the name *Celebrin-baur* \>
*Celebrimbor* \['Silver-fist'\]. This was a Sindarized form of T.
*Telperimpar* (Q. *Tyelpinquar*). It was a frequent name among the
Teleri, who in addition to navigation and ship-building were also
renowned as silver-smiths. The famous *Celebrimbor*, heroic defender of
Eregion in the Second-age war against Sauron, was a Teler, one of the
three Teleri who accompanied Celeborn into Exile.[^320] He was a great
silver-smith, and went to Eregion attracted by the rumours of the
marvellous metal found in Moria, Moria-silver, to which he gave the name
*mithril*. In the working of this he became a rival of the Dwarves, or
rather an equal, for there was great friendship between the Dwarves of
Moria and Celebrimbor, and they shared their skills and craft-secrets.
In the same way *Tegilbor* was used for one skilled in calligraphy
(*tegil* was a Sindarized form of Q. *tekil* 'pen', not known to the
Sindar until the coming of the Noldor). In Common Eldarin and the
derived languages the \**kwāra* was also used as a symbol of power and
authority.

Common Eldarin had also a word \**palatā*, a derivative of Common
Eldarin stem PAL, 'extended': *palat*, *palan-* 'wide, extended'
(originally also with the implication that the area was more or less
flat and even, without hindrance to movement, or view). Cf. Q. *palan*,
adv. 'far and wide'; *palda* 'wide, broad' (\< \**palnā*). \**palátā*,
Q. *palta*, T. *plata*, S. *plad* meant 'the flat of the hand, the hand
held upwards or forwards, flat and tensed (with fingers and thumb closed
or spread)'. This attitude had various important significances as
gestures in Eldarin custom (Q. *Mátengwië*, 'language of the hands').
One hand palm []{#calibre_link-1721 aria-label="180"
role="doc-pagebreak"}upwards was a gesture of a recipient, or of someone
asking for a gift; both hands so held indicated that one was at the
service or command of another person. A hand held palm forwards[^321]
towards another was a gesture of prohibition, commanding silence or
halting or ceasing from any action; forbidding advance, ordering retreat
or departure; rejection of a plea.[^322] The gesture of the Dúnadan,
Halbarad (L.R. III 47)[^323] was therefore not an Elvish sign, and would
have been ill received by them. In such a case their gesture was to open
both arms wide, somewhat below shoulder-level, with palms outward: in
this case as in the Mannish gesture the open palm signified "no weapon",
but the Elvish gesture added "not in either hand".[^324] Extension of
the fingers modified the significance. The gesture of a receiver or
asker, if the fingers and thumb were opened, indicated distress and
urgency of need or poverty. The gesture of prohibition in the same way
was made more hostile and threatening, indicating that if the command
was not immediately obeyed force or weapons would be used.

::: ext
Left and Right
:::

No distinction was felt between right and left by the Eldar. There was
nothing queer, ill-omened (sinister), weak, or inferior about the
"left". Nor anything more correct and proper (right), of good omen, or
honour about the "right".[^325] The Eldar were "ambidexters", and the
allocation of different habitual services or duties to the right or the
left was a purely individual and personal matter, undirected by any
general inherited racial habit.[^326] An Elda could usually write
[]{#calibre_link-1722 aria-label="181" role="doc-pagebreak"}with either
hand; if he wrote with the left he began on the right side, if with the
right on the left side -- because the Eldar found it more convenient
that the writing hand should not be liable to cover what had been
written immediately before the letter that it was engaged
on.[^327][^328]

In making the above-described gestures either hand was used without
change in significance. Making them with both was more emphatic,
indicating that the gesture expressed a command from a whole community
or party, or from a king or authority via a herald or subordinate. The
stone images of the Argonath each held up a hand, palm forwards, but it
was the left hand (L.R. I 409).[^329] It was a Mannish gesture: the left
hand was more hostile; and its use allowed the display in the right hand
of a weapon: an axe.

::: ext
Elsewhere among Tolkien's papers is found this sentence (which he
rendered in both Quenya and English) that also elaborates on this
concept of Elvish ambidexterity:
:::

The Elves were ambidexters; consequently, the left hand was not to them
evil in their imaginations. On the contrary. For if one turned the face
westwards as was usual, the left hand pointed away from Melkor (in the
North), and if northwards, it pointed towards Aman (the Blessed
Land).[^330]

::: ext
The fingers
:::

In Quenya the fingers were called, reckoning from the thumb outwards:
*nápo* 'thumb'; *lepetas* 'first or index finger'; *lepenel* or
*lepende* 'middle finger'; *lepekan* 'fourth finger'; *lepinka* 'little
finger'.

In children's play the names given (to which various stories were
attached) were: *atto/atya*; *emme/emya*; *tolyo* or *yonyo*; *nette* or
*selye*; *wine* or *winimo*: that is 'daddy', 'mummy', 'sticker-up' or
'big boy', 'girl' ('daughter'), 'baby'. The fingers and toes were called
*tille* []{#calibre_link-1723 aria-label="182" role="doc-pagebreak"}(pl.
*tilli*) 'tips, points'; or differentiated as *ortil(li)* 'up-point(s)'
and *nútil(li)* 'under-point(s)'. The same play-names *ataryo/taryo*
etc. could be given to the toes.

In ordinary language 'toe' was *taltil* (pl. *taltilli*); the big toe
was *taltol* or *tolbo*, and the other toes had no special names, but
were counted outwards from the big toe.

In the primitive days, before the Great Journey, while the building up
of the Common Eldarin language was in the making, play with the hands
and naming of the fingers went together with the naming of the numerals
(those above 2). The hand was the primitive counting instrument.[^331]
In the first stage one hand was used as a group-unit, and names were
devised for its separate prominences. Later both hands were laid out
with the tips of the thumbs touching.

T[EXT]{.small1} 2

The second text is extracted from a group of manuscript pages written in
a fairly clear hand in black nib-pen and placed just after text 3 below.
Internal linguistic evidence (not detailed here) shows however that its
composition preceded that of text 3.
:::

The stem of the Common Eldarin numeral for 9 was *neter*, which
resembles the Quenya play-name for the 4th finger (in Eldarin count):
*nette*, which is in 2-handed display, with thumbs inward, the 9th from
L or R. The name was old enough to appear in related forms in T.
*nette*, *nettica*, S. *netheg*. The resemblance was observed by the
earlier loremasters (who quote the Telerin forms otherwise not
recorded); but it was rejected as fortuitous, because *nette* had a
sense only suitable to the children's hand-plays in which the fingers
were represented as a family or two families of neighbours: it meant
'girl', but was a colloquial "family" diminutive of a Common Eldarin
base NETH (*not* NET) 'woman'.[^332][^333]

[]{#calibre_link-1724 aria-label="183" role="doc-pagebreak"}The
primitive handling of the fingers numerically was older than the
personalized play-names, though the two were interconnected. In the
numerical handling as the numerical list was filled up *nete* would come
before 5, or 10: one more beyond the prominent middle-finger. In the
primitive play-name series "father" (thumb) and "mother" (index) were
certainly the oldest, the others being just "children", though the
notable little finger possibly early had a name = "baby". It was here
that the resemblance between *net(e)* and *nette* became effective:
*nete* 'one more beyond the middle' and before the end of the count
became *nette* 'girl/daughter', and so caused \**tolya* 'prominent' to
become masculine, and generated for itself the definite variant *selye*
'daughter', and for *tolyo* the variant *yonyo* 'son': and the family
was complete.

*The fingers*. The 5 "fingers" included the *thumb*. Their naming is of
considerable interest, since it is connected with the development of the
*numerals* 1--10, the basis of the Eldarin decimal system, and also in
the "play-names" it gives a glimpse of the Eldarin children which the
legends and histories do not provide.

The numbers 1, 2: *one* (alone, or first) and *two* (another, or the
next) were probably the oldest and not necessarily originally connected
with the fingers: though the *thumb*, larger, differing in shape and
function from the others, and capable of being extended sideways, so
that it is alone and distinct, while it can also be brought alongside
the slenderer fingers and be the first in a series, is eminently suited
to the development of two distinct word-stems: (a) one, only, alone and
(b) one, first.[^334]

In using the hands as assisting in counting (and in teaching
[]{#calibre_link-1725 aria-label="184" role="doc-pagebreak"}counting)
they were laid down flat with the thumbs touching. The count, and
naming, then proceeded from thumb to little finger (in either
direction), and returning to the middle continued from the second thumb.
Each name thus occurred twice; and in two-handed reckoning had two
numerical places, the second being + 5. Connexion therefore between
numerals five apart, for example 3 and 8, would not be surprising --
insofar as the numerals can be shown to have etymological relations with
the finger-names occurring at the appropriate places.[^335]

The following account is an abbreviation of a curious document,
preserved in the archives of Gondor by strange chance (or by many such
chances) from the Elder Days, but in a copy apparently made in Númenor
not long before its downfall: probably by or at the orders of Elendil
himself, when selecting such records as he could hope to store for the
journey to Middle-earth. This one no doubt owed its selection and its
copying, first to Elendil's own love of the Eldarin tongues and of the
works of the loremasters who wrote about their history; but also to the
unusual contents of this disquisition in Quenya: *Eldarinwe Leperi are
Notessi*: The Elvish Fingers and Numerals. It is attributed, by the
copyist, to *Pengoloð* (or *Quendingoldo*) of Gondolin,[^336] and he
describes the Elvish play-names of the fingers as used by and taught to
children.

*The fingers*. The 5 "fingers" included the *thumb*. The Common Eldarin
word for 'finger' was *leper*, pl. *leperī*: Q. T. *leper*, pl. *ī*; S.
*leber*, *lebir*.

These were named from thumb (1) to little finger (5): (a) in Quenya 1.
*nápo*, 2. *tassa*, *lepetas*, 3. *lepenel*, 4. *lepente* or *lepekan*,
5. *níke* or *lepinke*; (b) in Telerin 1. *nāpa*, 2. *tassa*, 3. *i
nellepe*, 4. *nente*, 5. *nīke*; (c) in Sindarin 1. *nawb*, 2. *tas* or
*lebdas*, 3. *lebeneð*, 4. *lebent*, 5. *niged* or *lebig*. In addition
there was a dual formation naming thumb and index as a pair: Q. *nápat*,
T. *nāpat*, S. *nobad*.

[]{#calibre_link-1726 aria-label="185" role="doc-pagebreak"}In the
hand-play of children each hand was regarded as a "family" of 5: father,
mother, brother, sister, and little-one or baby, about which and their
family dealings and also, when two hands were juxtaposed, their
relations to the neighbouring family, tales were made-up, some handed on
traditionally, and others often improvised. There were more variations
in these than in the adult names, but the following were the best known:

1\. (thumb) Q. *atto*, *atya*; 2. *emme*, *emya*; 3. *tollo* or *hanno*;
4. *nette*; 5. *wine* or *winimo*, *win(i)ke*.

2\. T. *atta(ke)*; 2. *emme(ke*); 3. *tolle* or *hanna(ke)*; 4. *nette*
or *nettike*; 5. *winike* (*winke*, *pinke*).

Ingwë had curling golden hair. Finwë (and Míriel) had long dark hair, so

after settlement in Aman. Only Finwë's second son by Indis had fair
hair,[^337] and this remained generally characteristic of his
descendants, notably Finrod. Elwë and Olwë had very pale hair, almost
white. Melian was dark, and so was Lúthien.

Beards
:::

An account of these and the fact that the Elvish race had no beards, so
that this also became a mark of an Elvish strain in certain kingly
families of Númenórean descent.

A note was sent to Patricia Finney (Dec. 9/72), answering a question
about *beards*, that mentioned some of the male characters which she and
a friend did not imagine as having beards.[^338][^339] I replied that I
myself imagined Aragorn, Denethor, Imrahil, Boromir, Faramir as
beardless. This, I said, I supposed *not* to be due to any custom of
*shaving*, but a racial characteristic. None of the Eldar had any
beards, and this was a general racial characteristic of all Elves in my
"world".[^340] Any element of an Elvish strain in human ancestry was
very dominant and lasting (receding only slowly -- as might be seen in
[]{#calibre_link-1730 aria-label="189" role="doc-pagebreak"}Númenóreans
of royal descent, in the matter of longevity also).[^341] The tribes of
Men from whom the Númenóreans were descended were normal, and hence the
majority of them would have beards. But the royal house was
*half-elven*, having two strains of Elvish race in their ancestry
through Lúthien of Doriath (royal Sindarin) and Idril of Gondolin (royal
Noldorin). The effects were long-lasting: e.g. in a tendency to a
stature a little above the average, to a greater (though steadily
decreasing) longevity, and probably most lastingly in beardlessness.
Thus none of the Númenórean chieftains of descent from Elros (whether
kings or not) would be bearded. It is stated that Elendil was descended
from Silmariën, a royal princess.[^342][^343] Hence Aragorn and all his
ancestors were beardless.

The matter of Denethor and his sons is not so clear. But I explained
this by referring to Gandalf's remarks concerning Denethor: that "by
some chance" the Númenórean was nearly "true" in him[^344] -- meaning
that by some event in Denethor's ancestry which Gandalf had not
investigated,[^345] he had this mark of ultimately "royal" descent. This
"chance", I said, was to be seen in the fact that Húrin the First
Steward (from whom Denethor was directly descended) must have been a
*kinsman* of King Minardil (see L.R. III 319, 332, 333)[^346] sc. of
ultimately royal descent, though not near enough in kinship for him or
his descendants to claim the throne. I did not but could have noted the
following points. The Kings of Gondor had no doubt had "stewards" from
an early time, but these were only minor officials, charged with
supervision of the King's halls, houses, and lands. But the appointment
of Húrin of Emyn Arnen, a man of high Númenórean race, was different. He
was evidently the chief officer under the crown, prime counsellor of the
King, and at appointment endowed with the right to assume vice-regal
status, and assist in determining the choice of heir to the throne, if
this became vacant in his time. These functions all of his descendants
inherited. It may also be noted that they had *Quenya*
names,[^347][^348] which had long []{#calibre_link-1731 aria-label="190"
role="doc-pagebreak"}been a privilege only of those of proved royal
descent.

In the case of Faramir and Boromir another "strain" appears. Their
mother was Finduilas (another "Silmarillion" name), daughter of Adrahil
of Dol Amroth, and sister of Prince Imrahil. But this line had also a
special Elvish strain according to its own legends, as clearly noted in
the text (III 148).[^349]

The people of Belfalas (Dol Amroth) were mainly Númenórean in origin,
descendants of settlers before the division of the people or the armada
of Ar-Pharazôn. Hence they often used Númenórean Adûnaic names, since
the use of these was not then yet connected with rebellion against Eru.
But as Legolas's mention of Nimrodel shows there was an ancient Elvish
port near Dol Amroth, and a small settlement of Silvan Elves there from
Lórien.[^350] The legend of the prince's line was that one of their
earliest fathers had wedded an Elf-maiden: in some legends it was indeed
(evidently improbable) to have been Nimrodel herself; more probably in
other tales it was one of Nimrodel's companions who was lost in the
upper mountain glens.[^351]

In any case I do not imagine Imrahil as bearded.[]{#calibre_link-1732

In 1970 Allen & Unwin published a poster-sized *Map of Middle-earth*,
executed by the artist Pauline Baynes, and based upon that included in
*The Lord of the Rings*. On the map itself are a series of vignettes
portraying various locations significant to the story, such as the
Barrow-Downs and Minas Tirith; and above and below the map proper,
Baynes depicted the members of the Fellowship of the Ring, the Black
Riders, Gollum, Shelob, and other enemies of the West. On seeing the
finished art, Tolkien wrote a set of comments on these depictions of
places and characters. Some of these comments are appreciative: e.g.
Tolkien found four of the vignettes, sc. those depicting the Teeth of
Mordor, the Argonath, Barad-dûr, and Minas Morgul, particularly
well-executed, and described them as agreeing "remarkably with my own
vision ... *Minas Morgul* is almost exact"; and he found the depiction
of Aragorn good, those of Sam and Gimli "good enough", and that of
Boromir to be "the best figure, and most closely related to the text".
Other comments are less positive: e.g. of the vignettes he singled out
those of Minas Tirith and Hobbiton for particular dislike; and of the
depictions of characters he most disliked those of Gandalf, Legolas,
Gollum, the Black Riders (though he found them "impressive as sinister
cavaliers", he decried the addition of "*hats* and *plumes*" and the
"relief" of "their hell-black with elvish *green*"), and Shelob
(faulting in particular the positioning of her legs as "all apparently
growing out of her head") -- also that of Bill the Pony: "On the scale
of the men and the hobbits Bill is no pony. Also he was represented as
having become the special care and friend of Sam, who should be leading
him". In the course of these comments he offers details of how
[]{#calibre_link-855 aria-label="193" role="doc-pagebreak"}some of these
characters appeared in his own vision (some of which have been presented
elsewhere),[^352] as well as on the personality and roles of some, and
these details are selected and arranged for presentation here.[^353]

Gandalf
:::

In the story he was one of the Immortals, an emissary of the Valar. His
visible form was therefore a guise in which he walked among the peoples
of Middle-earth, a cloak for his power, wisdom, and compassion. But his
body was not a phantom: it was corporeal and could suffer and be hurt,
and though more slowly than mortal men he aged and was at the time of
the story white-haired and bent with care and labour. (He had then been
wandering -- the Grey Pilgrim -- mostly on foot through all the
Westlands for some two thousand years). His looks, and his manners, had
touches of the comic or grotesque (especially to hobbit-eyes),
reflecting the sense of humour of a fundamentally humble spirit. Even
the rare glimpses that he gave to those whom he specially loved of the
founts of hope and mirth that lay beneath were touched with it; a figure
strongly built with broad shoulders, though shorter than the average of
men and now stooped with age, leaning on a thick rough-cut staff as he
trudged along -- at the side of Aragorn.[^354] Gandalf's hat was
wide-brimmed (a shady hat, H. p. 14) with a pointed conical crown, and
it was *blue*; he wore a long *grey* cloak, but this would not reach
much below his knees. It was of an elven silver-grey hue, though
tarnished by wear -- as is evident from the general use of grey in the
book.

If I had known that Pauline Baynes was going to make a picture of
Gandalf, I could have shown her a sketch I made long ago, showing him
coming up the path to Bilbo's hole with his ("battered") blue hat more
or less so.[^355] Or better: the picture from which my personal vision
of him was largely derived. This is a picture postcard acquired years
ago -- probably in Switzerland.[^356] It is one of a series of six taken
from the work of a German artist J. Madlener, called *Gestalten aus
Märchen und Sage* \['Characters from Stories and Legends'\]. Alas! I
only got one called *Der Berggeist* \['The Sorcerer', lit. 'The
Mountain-spirit'\]. []{#calibre_link-1734 aria-label="194"
role="doc-pagebreak"}On a rock under a pine-tree is seated a small but
broad old man with a wide-brimmed round hat and a long cloak talking to
a white fawn that is nuzzling his upturned hands. He has a humorous but
also compassionate expression -- his mouth is visible and smiling
because he has a white beard but no hair on his upper lip. The scene is
a woodland glade (pine, fir, and birch) beside a rivulet with a glimpse
of rocky mountain-towers in the distance. An owl and four other smaller
birds are looking on from the branches of the trees. The Berggeist has a
green hat, and a scarlet cloak, blue stockings and light shoes. I
altered the colours of hat and cloak to suit Gandalf, a wanderer in the
wild, but I have no doubt that when at ease in a house he wore light
blue stockings and shoes.

He was the friend and confidant of all living creatures of good will (I
375).[^357] He differed from Radagast and Saruman in that he never
turned aside from his appointed mission ("I was the Enemy of Sauron",
III 294)[^358] and was unsparing of himself. Radagast was fond of beasts
and birds, and found them easier to deal with; he did not become proud
and domineering, but neglectful and easygoing, and he had very little to
do with Elves or Men although obviously resistance to Sauron had to be
sought chiefly in their cooperation. But since he remained of good will
(though he had not much courage), his work in fact helped Gandalf at
crucial moments. Though it is clear that Gandalf (with greater insight
and compassion) had in fact more knowledge of birds and beasts than
Radagast, and was regarded by them with more respect and affection.
(This contrast is already to be seen in *The Hobbit* 124-5. Beorn, a
lover of animals, but also of gardens and flowers, thought Radagast a
good enough fellow, but evidently not very effective.)

Legolas

The Legolas of the story was an Elvish prince of Sindarin race (III
363), clad in the *green and brown* of the Silvan Elves over whom his
father ruled (I 253): tall as a young tree (II 28), lithe, immensely
strong, able swiftly to draw a great war-bow and shoot down a
Nazgul,[^359][^360] endowed with the still tremendous vitality of elvish
bodies, so hard and resistant to hurt that he went only in light shoes
over rock or through snow (I 306), the most tireless of all the
Fellowship.[^361]

[]{#calibre_link-1735 aria-label="195" role="doc-pagebreak"}Hobbits
:::

*Halflings* was derived from the Númenórean name for them (in Sindarin
*Periannath*). It was given first to the Harfoots, who became known to
the rulers of Arnor in the eleventh century of the Third Age; later it
was also applied to the Fallohides and Stoors. The name thus evidently
referred to their height as compared with Númenórean men, and was
approximately accurate when first given. The Númenóreans were a people
of great stature. Their full-grown men were often seven feet tall.

The descriptions and assumptions of the text are not in fact haphazard,
and are based on a standard: the average height of a male adult hobbit
at the time of the story. For Harfoots this was taken as 3 ft. 6;
Fallohides were slimmer and a little taller; and Stoors broader,
stouter, and somewhat shorter. The remarks in the *Prologue*
\[concerning the height of hobbits\] are unnecessarily vague and
complicated, owing to the inclusion of references to supposed modern
survivals of the race in later times; but as far as the LR is concerned
they boil down to this: the hobbits of the Shire were in height between
3 and 4 feet, never less and seldom more. They did not of course call
themselves *Halflings*.

::: ext
Heights
:::

The *Quendi* were in origin a tall people. The Eldar were those who
accepted the invitation of the Valar to remove from Middle-earth and set
forth on the Great March to the Western Shores of Middle-earth. They
were in general the stronger and taller members of the Elvish folk at
that time. In Eldarin tradition it was said that even their women were
seldom less than 6 ft. in height; their full-grown elfmen no less than 6
ft. 6, while some of the great kings and leaders were taller.

The Númenóreans before the Downfall were a people of great stature and
strength, the Kings of Men; their full-grown men were commonly 7 ft.
tall, especially in the royal and noble houses. In the North where men
of other kinds were fewer and their race remained purer this stature
remained more frequent. Elendil the Tall, leader of the Faithful who
survived the Downfall, was said to have surpassed 7 ft., though his sons
were not quite so tall. Aragorn, his direct descendant, in spite of the
many intervening generations, must still have been a very tall and
strong man with a great stride; he was probably at least 6 ft. 6.
Boromir, of high Númenórean lineage, would not be much shorter: say 6
ft. 4.

[]{#calibre_link-1736 aria-label="196" role="doc-pagebreak"}These
figures \[of the Fellowship\] are thus all too short. Gandalf even bent
must have been at least 5 ft. 6; Legolas at least 6 foot (probably
more); Gimli is about the height that the hobbits should have been, but
was probably somewhat taller; the hobbits should have been between 3 ft.
4 and 3 ft. 6. (I personally have always thought of Sam as the shortest,
but the sturdiest in build, of the four).

Dwarves were about 4 ft. high at least. Hobbits were lighter in build,
but not much shorter; their tallest men were 4 ft., but seldom taller.
Though nowadays their survivors are seldom 3 ft. high, in the days of
the story they were taller, which means that they usually exceeded 3 ft.
and qualified for the name of *Halfling*. But the name "halfling" must
have originated circa Third Age 1150, getting on for 2,000 years (1868)
before the War of the Ring, during which the dwindling of the
Númenóreans had shown itself in stature as well as in life-span; so that
it referred to a height of full-grown males of an average of, say, 3 ft.
5.

The dwindling of the Dúnedain was not a normal tendency, shared by
peoples whose proper home was Middle-earth; but due to the loss of their
ancient land far in the West, nearest of all mortal lands to "The
Undying Realm". In both Arnor and Gondor, apart from mixture of race,
the Númenóreans showed a dwindling of height and longevity in
Middle-earth that became more marked as the Third Age passed. The much
later dwindling of hobbits must be due to a change in their state and
way of life; they became a fugitive and secret people, driven as Men,
the Big Folk, became more and more numerous, usurping the more fertile
and habitable lands, to refuge in forest or wilderness: a wandering and
poor folk, forgetful of their arts and living a precarious life absorbed
in the search for food and fearful of being seen; for cruel men would
shoot them for sport as if they were animals. In fact they relapsed into
the state of "pygmies". The other stunted race, the Drúedain, never rose
much above that state.

Gollum
:::

Gollum was according to Gandalf one of a riverside hobbit people--and
therefore in origin a member of a small variety of the human race,
although he had become deformed during his long inhabiting of the dark
lake. His long hands are therefore more or less right. Not his feet.
They are exaggerated. They are described as *webby* (Hobbit 88), *like a
swan's* (I 398), but had prehensile toes (II 219). But he was very thin
-- in the LR emaciated, not plump and rubbery; he had for his size a
*large head* and a *long thin neck*, very large eyes
[]{#calibre_link-1737 aria-label="197"
role="doc-pagebreak"}(protuberant), and thin lank hair. He is often said
to be dark or black. At his first mention (Hob. 83) he was "dark as
darkness": that of course means no more than that he could not be seen
with ordinary eyes in the black cavern -- except for his own large
luminous eyes; similarly "the dark shape" at night (I 399, 400). But
that does not apply to the "black (crawling) shape" (II 219, 220), where
he was in moonlight.[^362]

Gollum was never *naked*. He had a pocket in which he kept the Ring
(Hob. 92). He evidently had black garments (II 219), and in the "eagle"
passage (II 253),[^363] where it is said that from far above, as he lay
on the ground, he would look like "the famished skeleton of some child
of Men, its ragged garment still clinging to it, its long arms and legs
almost bone-white and bone-thin". His skin was white, no doubt with a
pallor increased by dwelling long in the dark, and later by hunger. He
remained a human being, not an animal or a mere bogey, even if deformed
in mind and body: an object of disgust, but also of pity -- to the
deep-sighted, such as Frodo had become. There is no need to wonder how
he came by clothes or replaced them: any consideration of the tale will
show that he had plenty of opportunities by theft, or charity (as of the
Wood-elves), throughout his life.

::: ext
Black Riders
:::

They are clearly described as being themselves *invisible* and clad in
long black cloaks with great *hoods* that hung down over their faces, so
that people they met would not realize that they had no visible faces (I
84).[^364] Neither could their hands be seen. In any case horsemen so
accoutred would have worn gauntlets. Nor of course would their limbs
have been so thin and emaciated if visible.

::: ext
Shelob
:::

Shelob is not described in precise spider terms; but she was "most like
a spider" (II 334).[^365] As such she was enormously magnified; and she
had two horns and two great clusters of eyes. But she had the
characteristic tight constriction of spiders between the front section
(head and thorax) and the rear (belly) -- this is called (II 334) her
"neck", because the rear portion is swollen and bloated out of
proportion. She was *black*, except for the underpart of her belly,
which was "pale and luminous" with corruption. She would have eight
legs, properly disposed, four a side, where they could function as
organs of movement and seizure.[]{#calibre_link-841 aria-label="198"

For further discussion of communication between minds, see chap. IX,
"*Ósanwe-kenta*", below.
:::

The High Elves distinguished clearly between *fanar*, the "physical"
raiment adopted by the Spirits in self-incarnation, as a mode of
communication with the Incarnates,[^366] and other modes of
communication between minds, that might take "visual" forms.

They held that a superior "mind" by nature, or one exerting itself to
its full in some extremity of need, could communicate a desired "vision"
direct to another mind. The receiving mind would translate this impulse
into the terms familiar to it from its use of the physical organs of
sight (and hearing) and project it, seeing it as something external. It
thus much resembled a *fana*, except that in most cases, especially
those concerned with minds of less power (either as communicators or
receivers) it would frequently be less vivid, clear or detailed, and
might even be vague or dim or appear half-transparent. These "visions"
were in Quenya called *indemmar* 'mind-pictures'.[^367]
[]{#calibre_link-1739 aria-label="200" role="doc-pagebreak"}Men were
receptive of them; according to the records of the time, mostly when
presented to them by the Elves. To receive them from another human being
required a special urgency of occasion, and a close connexion of
kinship, anxiety or love between the two minds.

In any case *indemmar* were by Men mostly received in sleep (dream). If
received when bodily awake they were usually vague and phantom-like (and
often caused fear); but if they were clear and vivid, as the *indemmar*
induced by Elves might be, they were apt to mislead Men into taking them
as "real" things beheld by normal sight. Though this deceit was never
intentional on the part of the Elves,[^368] it was often by them \[i.e.,
Men\] believed to be.

Among the "several pages of roughly written notes" at the end of the c.
1957 manuscript version (A) of *Laws and Customs among the Eldar* (see
X:250) are two lengthy notes, written by contrast in a clear hand, but
likewise in black nib-pen, concerning (broadly speaking) the nature of
knowledge and of memory among the Eldar. The first of these arose as a
long digression on the opening of the note concerning Elvish knowledge
of the "Fate of Men" that Christopher Tolkien labels "(ii)" (X:251),
sparked by the words "'supposed' or 'guessed'" there.
:::

T[EXT]{.small1} 1

The Eldar hold some things "for certain": they therefore *know* or
*assert* things, when the evidence or authority is sufficient for
certainty. They *judge* and have an *opinion*, when the evidence is
sufficient to consider with reason (or the authority worthy of
attention), but incomplete (or not compulsive). When the evidence is
very incomplete (and there is no authority) they *suppose* or *surmise*.
When the evidence is too incomplete for reasonable inference, or is not
known they *guess*. This last process they do not usually distinguish
from *feign* or *pretend* \[save\] only in this: that *guessing* implies
a wish to know (and would use more evidence if that were available); it
is intended to correspond as far as possible to fact, independent of the
guessing mind; whereas *feigning* refers primarily to the mind itself,
and is rather an exercise, or amusement, of the mind, independent of
fact.[^369]

[]{#calibre_link-847 aria-label="202" role="doc-pagebreak"}They
distinguish all these from *divining*, which is neither *guessing* nor
*feigning*; for they hold that the *fëa* can arrive directly at
knowledge, or close to it, without reasoning upon evidence or learning
from living authority. Though *divining* is, they say, truly only a
swift mode of learning from authority: since the *fëa* can only learn
(apart from reasoning) by direct contact with other minds, or at the
highest by "inspiration" from Eru. (This is truly called "divining".)
This contact can at times take place between embodied minds of the same
order without bodily contact or proximity. Minds of a higher Order, such
as the Valar (including Melkor) can more easily influence those of a
lower order (such as the Eldar) from afar. They cannot thus coerce or
dictate, though they can inform and advise.[^370] This too (except at
great need) they do only when the mind is of its consent or desire
opened to them: particularly, as when one of the Eldar calls one of the
Valar by name in some need or doubt; generally as when one of the Eldar
places himself under the protection and guidance of Manwë or Varda (or
other Vala).[^371]

The occupations of the embodied mind awake are an obstacle to such
contacts, lower or higher. They occur therefore, the Eldar say, most
often in "sleep" -- not in "dreams". But "dreaming" and "sleeping" are
to the Elves other than to Men. In sleep the *body* may, as in Men,
cease from all activities (save those essential to life, such as
breathing); or it may rest from this or that activity or function[^372]
as the *fëa* directs. While it is so, the mind may seek repose also, and
be utterly quiet, but it may be absorbed in its own activity: "thinking"
-- that is, reasoning or remembering, or devising and designing; but
these things are at will and of volition. The state that with the Elves
nearest resembles human "dreaming" is when the mind is "feigning" or
devising.[^373] It is when the mind is quiet and inactive that it most
readily receives and perceives contacts from without.[^374]

Note on Elvish Memory, especially of the Reborn, & its relation to
Language[^375]
:::

It will be seen that by *rebirth* the memory of things and happenings in
the past may be for the Eldar long and abundant and fresh. (Fresh since
the "Waiting"[^376] does not in their memory occupy time: to an Elf that
had waited a thousand years the events of a thousand years before would
seem by that space the nearer than to one who had not.) But this is not
*complete*. Those who had passed through a Waiting often desired to
forget some or all of their past, and they were relieved of their memory
of such things. Others, remembering, would not communicate their
recollection.[^377]

There was one matter in which *rebirth* did not assist their "lore" --
though this might be expected to be otherwise. This was the history and
lore of *language* and the speech of bygone days. In such matters the
Eldar were dependent mostly, as are we, upon visible records, or upon
the "lore" consciously stored in the minds of those concerned with the
branch of history. "Upon lore" not memory, that is -- instinctive memory
for the language of any Elf is that of the time in which he speaks; the
languages of other *times* (as of other peoples and places) he must
learn consciously, or deliberately store in mind as a thing separate
from unpremeditated speech, the immediate and "natural" clothing of his
thought. Not all the Eldar can do this, or do it readily and accurately;
only "loremasters" specially concerned with "lore of tongues" commit
such things (as for example the language of the period in which they are
at that time) to visible record, or to the storehouse of mental lore.

Thus it will be seen that an Elf, remembering the past, must, if he will
communicate it, clothe it in language. But to them "language" is
essentially an art of the cohering *fëa* and *hrondo*,[^378] and the
chief product of their cooperation. The reborn Elf must learn language
anew, and he will therefore re-clothe all his memory in the language of
the later time (even as his *fëa* is reclothed in a body belonging to
that time).

But it may be asked: "Will he not remember *sounds*? And will he not
remember things that have been said to him and by him?" The answer is
*yes* and *no*. In the disbodied Waiting he had *no* language (for that
requires a body and is not required without one), only "thought".
Through this interval all memory of his former life has passed; and it
must, therefore, be re-clothed. He will, of course, remember *sounds*,
and find words to describe those heard long ago, even as he might
[]{#calibre_link-1741 aria-label="204" role="doc-pagebreak"}describe
light, or colours, or emotions. But, say the Eldar, "language" is not
*sounds*. Things said or heard in "language" are remembered as thoughts
or meanings, and must be re-embodied in those modes of expression which
at any given time a "speaking creature" uses without reflection.

Thus, those specially gifted to observe and recall variations of *sound*
(as others may be gifted to observe and recall *colour*) might be able
to recall and to repeat a sequence of spoken sounds heard long before.
But this sequence would be dissociated from meaning, even as it would
be, if an Elf found it written down in an ancient book; and it would
have to be translated or deciphered by reference to the context of
remembered scenes in which it occurred (aided by resemblances which it
might still possess to other known tongues or periods of tongues). Thus
it has come to pass that the Eldar possess much accurate lore concerning
the speech-sounds used in days long past, but the linguistic memories of
the Reborn are in other respects only like broken fragments of old books
that must be reinterpreted and deciphered by lore and reasoning.

The text ends here, near the bottom of a page; or rather, the text *in
this mode* *of relation* ends here. For in the margins of the page the
topic of memory and "reclothing" of speech is taken up again in a new
mode, with a first-person narrator, sc. Ælfwine -- the c. 900 A.D.
Anglo-Saxon mariner who serves as an interlocutor with the Elves, and
especially with the loremaster Pengoloð, in numerous texts of this
period[^379] -- as indicated by the words: "Quoth Ælfwine" written
faintly but ornately in pencil in the left margin.
:::

To me the Eldar said: "You may understand this by considering the case
of Men. Suppose now that a Man listened to a discourse in his own tongue
and understood it in full as spoken. If then that by some chance,
strange but not impossible, by change of life, by exile, or by some
sickness, his mother-tongue were to be changed and utterly forgotten,
how would he report the discourse? He would reclothe its meaning in the
language that he now used as the natural expression of meanings. For the
Eldar, contemporary languages (of common origin), which we should call
kindred languages, or dialects according to the degree of divergence,
and the same language lineally considered at widely sundered periods,
present almost identical problems. In their earlier days their language
(as other characteristics) changed hardly less quickly than those of
Men."[]{#calibre_link-1742 aria-label="205" role="doc-pagebreak"}

The far-ranging essay entitled by Tolkien in Quenya *Ósanwe-kenta*,
'Enquiry into the Communication of Thought', occupies eight typescript
pages, numbered 1--8 by Tolkien. It is presented and (self-)described as
a "résumé" (see below) or "abbreviation" (X:415) by an unnamed
redactor[^380] of another work of the same title that the Elvish
Loremaster Pengolodh "set at the end of his *Lammas* or 'Account of
Tongues'" (*ibid*.).[^381] While thus a separate document, it
nonetheless is closely associated and no doubt closely contemporary with
the longer essay that Tolkien titled *Quendi and Eldar* (the bulk of
which has been published in *The War of the Jewels*), with which it is
located among Tolkien's papers.[^382]

According to Christopher Tolkien, one of the copies of *Quendi and
Eldar* is "preserved in a folded newspaper of March 1960", and notes
written by his father on this paper and on the cover of the other copy
include the *Ósanwe-kenta* among the Appendices to *Quendi and Eldar*
(X:415). Christopher concludes that this complex of materials, including
the *Ósanwe-kenta*, "was thus in being when the newspaper was used for
this purpose, and although, as in other similar cases, this does not
provide a perfectly certain *terminus ad quem*, there seems to be no
reason to doubt that it belongs to 1959--60" (*ibid*.).

The eight typescript pages presented here appear to comprise the sole
extant text of the *Ósanwe-kenta*; if it was preceded by any typescript
or manuscript versions, they have apparently not been preserved. In the
top margin of the first of these pages, Tolkien has written the three
lines of its present title in ink. He has also numbered the first seven
pages in the upper right-hand corner by hand, []{#calibre_link-856
aria-label="207" role="doc-pagebreak"}and written the notation
"*Ósanwe*" to the left of the numeral on each of these pages, also in
ink; but the page number and notation are typed in the same positions on
the eighth page. This suggests that Tolkien may have paused, or perhaps
originally concluded the essay, somewhere on the seventh page, and
written the short title and page number on those pages he had typed at
that point, before the eighth page was begun. If so, he may have done so
at the break on the seventh page indicated by a blank space before the
paragraph beginning "If we speak last of the 'folly' of Manwë". The
typescript has also been emended at points by Tolkien in ink, chiefly in
correction of typographical errors, though on a few occasions supplying
a change of wording. Save in a very few instances these changes have
been incorporated silently in this edition.

For further discussion of the phenomenon of thought-communcation, see
see chap. VII, "Mind-Pictures", above, and text 2, "Concerning Spirit",

*Ósanwe-kenta*

"Enquiry into the Communication of Thought"

(résumé of Pengolodh's discussion)
:::

At the end of the *Lammas* Pengolodh discusses briefly direct
thought-transmission (*sanwe-latya* 'thought-opening'), making several
assertions about it, which are evidently dependent upon theories and
observations of the Eldar elsewhere treated at length by Elvish
loremasters. They are concerned primarily with the Eldar and the Valar
(including the lesser Maiar of the same order). Men are not specially
considered, except in so far as they are included in general statements
about the Incarnates (*Mirröanwi*). Of them Pengolodh says only: "Men
have the same faculty as the Quendi, but it is in itself weaker, and is
weaker in operation owing to the strength of the *hröa*, over which most
men have small control by the will".

Pengolodh includes this matter primarily owing to its connexion with
*tengwesta* \['language'\]. But he is also concerned as an historian to
examine the relations of Melkor and his agents with the Valar and the
Eruhíni,[^383] though this also has a connexion with "language", since,
as he points out, this, the greatest of the talents of the *Mirröanwi*,
has been turned by Melkor to his own greatest advantage.

[]{#calibre_link-1744 aria-label="208" role="doc-pagebreak"}Pengolodh
says that all *minds* (*sáma*, pl. *sámar*) are equal in status, though
they differ in capacity and strength. A mind by its nature perceives
another mind directly. But it cannot perceive more than the existence of
another mind (as something other than itself, though of the same order)
except by the *will* of both parties.[^384] The degree of *will*,
however, need not be the same in both parties. If we call one mind G
(for guest or comer) and the other H (for host or receiver), then G must
have full intention to inspect H or to inform it. But knowledge may be
gained or imparted by G, even when H is not seeking or intending[^385]
to impart or to learn: the act of G will be effective, if H is simply
'open' (*láta*; *látië* 'openness'). This distinction, he says, is of
the greatest importance.

"Openness" is the natural or simple state (*indo*) of a mind that is not
otherwise engaged.[^386] In "Arda Unmarred" (that is, in ideal
conditions free from evil)[^387] openness would be the normal state.
Nonetheless any mind may be *closed* (*pahta*). This requires an act of
conscious will: *Unwill* (*avanir*). It may be made against G, against G
and some others, or be a total retreat into privacy (*aquapahtië*).

Though in "Arda Unmarred" openness is the normal state, every mind has,
from its first making as an individual, the right to close; and it has
absolute power to make this effective by will. *Nothing can penetrate
the barrier of Unwill*.[^388]

All these things, says Pengolodh, are true of all minds, from the Ainur
in the presence of Eru, or the great Valar such as Manwë and Melkor, to
the Maiar in Eä, and down to the least of the *Mirröanwi*. But different
states bring in *limitations*, which are not fully controlled by the
will.

The Valar entered into Eä and Time of free will, and they are now in
Time, so long as it endures. They can perceive nothing outside Time,
save by memory of their existence before it began: they can
[]{#calibre_link-1745 aria-label="209" role="doc-pagebreak"}recall the
Song and the Vision. They are, of course, open to Eru, but they cannot
of their own will "see" any part of His mind. They can open themselves
to Eru in entreaty, and He may then reveal His thought to them.[^389]

The Incarnates have by the nature of *sáma* the same faculties; but
their perception is dimmed by the *hröa*, for their *fëa* is united to
their *hröa* and its normal procedure is through the *hröa*, which is in
itself part of Eä, without thought. The dimming is indeed double; for
thought has to pass one mantle of *hröa* and penetrate another. For this
reason in Incarnates transmission of thought requires *strengthening* to
be effective. Strengthening can be by *affinity*, by *urgency*, or by
*authority*.

*Affinity* may be due to kinship; for this may increase the likeness of
*hröa* to *hröa*, and so of the concerns and modes of thought of the
indwelling *fëar*; kinship is also normally accompanied by love and
sympathy. Affinity may come simply from love and friendship, which is
likeness or affinity of *fëa* to *fëa*.

*Urgency* is imparted by great need of the "sender" (as in joy, grief,
or fear); and if these things are in any degree shared by the "receiver"
the thought is the clearer received. *Authority* may also lend force to
the thought of one who has a duty towards another, or of any ruler who
has a right to issue commands or to seek the truth for the good of
others.

These causes may strengthen the thought to pass the veils and reach a
recipient mind. But that mind must remain open, and at the least
passive. If, being aware that it is addressed, it then closes, no
urgency or affinity will enable the sender's thought to enter.

Lastly, *tengwesta* \['language'\] has also become an impediment.[^390]
It is in Incarnates clearer and more precise than their direct reception
of thought. By it also they can communicate easily with others, when no
strength is added to their thought: as, for example, when strangers
first meet. And, as we have seen, the use of "language" soon becomes
habitual, so that the practice of *ósanwe* (interchange of thought) is
neglected and becomes more difficult. Thus we see that the Incarnate
tend more and more to use or to endeavour to use *ósanwe* only in great
need and urgency, and especially when *lambë* \['speech'\] is
[]{#calibre_link-1746 aria-label="210" role="doc-pagebreak"}unavailing;
as when the voice cannot be heard, which comes most often because of
distance. For distance in itself offers no impediment whatever to
*ósanwe*. But those who by affinity might well use *ósanwe* will use
*lambë* when in proximity, by habit or preference. Yet we may mark also
how the "affine" may more quickly understand the *lambë* that they use
between them, and indeed all that they would say is not put into words.
With fewer words they come swifter to a better understanding. There can
be no doubt that here *ósanwe* is also often taking place; for the will
to converse in *lambë* is a will to communicate thought, and lays the
minds open. It may be, of course, that the two that converse know
already part of the matter and the thought of the other upon it, so that
only allusions dark to the stranger need be made; but this is not always
so. The affine will reach an understanding more swiftly than strangers
upon matters that neither have before discussed, and they will more
quickly perceive the import of words that, however numerous,
well-chosen, and precise, must remain inadequate.

The *hröa* and *tengwesta* have inevitably some like effect upon the
Valar, if they assume bodily raiment. The *hröa* will to some degree dim
in force and precision the sending of the thought, and if the other be
also embodied the reception of it. If they have acquired the habit of
*tengwesta*, as some may who have acquired the custom of being arrayed,
then this will reduce the practice of *ósanwe*. But these effects are
far less than in the case of the Incarnate.

For the *hröa* of a Vala, even when it has become customary, is far more
under the control of the will. The thought of the Valar is far stronger
and more penetrant. And so far as concerns their dealings one with
another, the affinity between the Valar is greater than the affinity
between any other beings; so that the use of *tengwesta* or *lambë* has
never become imperative, and only with some has it become a custom and
preference. And as for their dealings with all other minds in Eä, their
thought often has the highest authority, and the greatest urgency.

Here Pengolodh adds a long note on the use of *hröar* by the Valar. In
brief he says that though in origin a "self-arraying", it may tend to
approach the state of "incarnation", especially with the lesser members
of that order (the Maiar). "It is said that the longer and the more the
same *hröa* is used, the greater is the bond of habit, and the less do
the 'self-arrayed' desire to leave it. As raiment may soon cease to be
adornment, and becomes (as is said in the tongues of both Elves and Men)
a 'habit', a customary garb. Or if among Elves []{#calibre_link-1747
aria-label="211" role="doc-pagebreak"}and Men it be worn to mitigate
heat or cold, it soon makes the clad body less able to endure these
things when naked". Pengolodh also cites the opinion that if a "spirit"
(that is, one of those not embodied by creation) uses a *hröa* for the
furtherance of its personal purposes, or (still more) for the enjoyment
of bodily faculties, it finds it increasingly difficult to operate
without the *hröa*. The things that are most binding are those that in
the Incarnate have to do with the life of the *hröa* itself, its
sustenance and its propagation. Thus eating and drinking are binding,
but not the delight in beauty of sound or form. Most binding is
begetting or conceiving.[^391]

"We do not know the *axani* (laws, rules, as primarily proceeding from
Eru) that were laid down upon the Valar with particular reference to
their state, but it seems clear that there was no *axan* against these
things. Nonetheless it appears to be an *axan*, or maybe necessary
consequence, that if they are done, then the spirit must dwell in the
body that it used, and be under the same necessities as the Incarnate.
The only case that is known in the histories of the Eldar is that of
Melian who became the spouse of King Elu-thingol. This certainly was not
evil or against the will of Eru, and though it led to sorrow, both Elves
and Men were enriched.

"The great Valar do not do these things: they beget not, neither do they
eat and drink, save at the high *asari* \['festivals'\], in token of
their lordship and indwelling of Arda, and for the blessing of the
sustenance of the Children. Melkor alone of the Great became at last
bound to a bodily form; but that was because of the use that he made of
this in his purpose to become Lord of the Incarnate, and of the great
evils that he did in the visible body. Also he had dissipated his native
powers in the control of his agents and servants, so that he became in
the end, in himself and without their support, a weakened thing,
consumed by hate and unable to restore himself from the state into which
he had fallen. Even his visible form he could no longer master, so that
its hideousness could not any longer be masked, and it showed forth the
evil of his mind. So it was also with even some of his greatest
servants, as in these later days we see: they became wedded to the forms
of their evil deeds, and if these bodies were taken from them or
destroyed, they were nullified, until they had rebuilt a semblance of
their former habitations, with which they could continue the evil
courses in which they had become fixed".[^392][^393]

[]{#calibre_link-1748 aria-label="212" role="doc-pagebreak"}Pengolodh
then proceeds to the abuses of *sanwe*. "For" he says, "some who have
read so far, may already have questioned my lore, saying: 'This seems
not to accord with the histories. If the *sáma* were inviolable by
force, how could Melkor have deceived so many minds and enslaved so
many? Or is it not rather true that the *sáma* may be protected by
greater strength but captured also by greater strength? Wherefore
Melkor, the greatest, and even to the last possessing the most fixed,
determined and ruthless will, could penetrate the minds of the Valar,
but withhold himself from them, so that even Manwë in dealing with him
may seem to us at times feeble, unwary, and deceived. Is this not so?'

"I say that it is not so. Things may seem alike, but if they are in kind
wholly different they must be distinguished. *Foresight* which is
prevision,[^394] and *forecasting*[^395] which is opinion made by
reasoning upon present evidence, may be identical in their prediction,
but they are wholly different in mode, and they should be distinguished
by loremasters, even if the daily language of both Elves and Men gives
them the same name as departments of wisdom".[^396]

In like manner, extortion of the secrets of a mind may seem to come from
reading it by force in despite of its unwill, for the knowledge gained
may at times appear to be as complete as any that could be obtained.
Nonetheless it does not come from penetration of the barrier of unwill.

There is indeed no *axan* that the barrier should not be forced,
[]{#calibre_link-1749 aria-label="213" role="doc-pagebreak"}for it is
*únat*, a thing impossible to be or to be done, and the greater the
force exerted, the greater the resistance of the unwill.[^397] But it is
an *axan* universal that none shall directly by force or indirectly by
fraud take from another what he has a right to hold and keep as his own.

Melkor repudiated all *axani*. He would also abolish (for himself) all
*únati* if he could. Indeed in his beginning and the days of his great
might the most ruinous of his violences came from his endeavour so to
order Eä that there were no limits or obstacles to his will. But this he
could not do. The *únati* remained, a perpetual reminder of the
existence of Eru and His invincibility, a reminder also of the
co-existence with himself of other beings (equal in descent if not in
power) impregnable by force. From this proceeds his unceasing and
unappeasable rage.

He found that the open approach of a *sáma* of power and great force of
will was felt by a lesser *sáma* as an immense pressure, accompanied by
fear. To dominate by weight of power and fear was his delight; but in
this case he found them unavailing: fear closed the door faster.
Therefore he tried deceit and stealth.

Here he was aided by the simplicity of those unaware of evil, or not yet
accustomed to beware of it. And for that reason it was said above that
the distinction of openness and active will to entertain was of great
importance. For he would come by stealth to a mind open and unwary,
hoping to learn some part of its thought before it closed, and still
more to implant in it his own thought, to deceive it and win it to his
friendship. His thought was ever the same, though varied to suit each
case (so far as he understood it): he was above all benevolent; he was
rich and could give any gift that they desired to his friends; he had a
special love for the one that he addressed; but he must be trusted.

In this way he won entry into many minds, removing their unwill, and
unlocking the door by the only key, though his key was counterfeit. Yet
this was not what he most desired: the conquest of the recalcitrant, the
enslavement of his enemies. Those who listened and did not close the
door were too often already inclined to his friendship; some (according
to their measure) had already entered on paths like his own, and
listened because they hoped to learn and receive from him things that
would further their own purposes. (So it was with those of the Maiar who
first and earliest fell under his domination. They were already rebels,
but lacking Melkor's power and ruthless will they admired him, and saw
in his leadership hope of effective rebellion.) But those who were yet
simple and uncorrupted []{#calibre_link-1750 aria-label="214"
role="doc-pagebreak"}in "heart"[^398] were at once aware of his entry,
and if they listened to the warning of their hearts, ceased to listen,
ejected him, and closed the door. It was such as these that Melkor most
desired to overcome: his enemies, for to him all were enemies who
resisted him in the least thing or claimed anything whatsoever as their
own and not his.[^399]

Therefore he sought means to circumvent the *únat* and the unwill. And
this weapon he found in "language". For we speak now of the Incarnate,
the Eruhíni whom he most desired to subjugate in Eru's despite. Their
bodies being of Eä are subject to force; and their spirits, being united
to their bodies in love and solicitude, are subject to fear on their
behalf. And their language, though it comes from the spirit or mind,
operates through and with the body: it is not the *sáma* nor its
*sanwe*, but it may express the *sanwe* in its mode and according to its
capacity. Upon the body and upon the indweller, therefore, such pressure
and such fear may be exerted that the incarnate person may be forced to
speak.

So Melkor thought in the darkness of his forethought long ere we awoke.
For in days of old, when the Valar instructed the Eldar new-come to Aman
concerning the beginning of things and the enmity of Melkor, Manwë
himself said to those who would listen: "Of the Children of Eru Melkor
knew less than his peers, giving less heed to what he might have
learned, as we did, in the Vision of their Coming. Yet, as we now fear
since we know you in your true being, to everything that might aid his
designs for mastery his mind was keen to attend, and his purpose leaped
forward swifter than ours, being bound by no *axan*. From the first he
was greatly interested in 'language', that talent that the Eruhíni would
have by nature; but we did not at once perceive the malice in this
interest, for many of us shared it, and Aulë above all. But in time we
discovered that he had made a language for those who served him; and he
has learned our tongue with ease. He has great skill in this matter.
Beyond doubt he will master all tongues, even the fair speech of the
Eldar. Therefore, if ever you should speak with him beware!"

"Alas!" says Pengolodh, "in Valinor Melkor used the Quenya with such
mastery that all the Eldar were amazed, for his use could not be
bettered, scarce equalled even, by the poets and the loremasters."

[]{#calibre_link-1751 aria-label="215" role="doc-pagebreak"}Thus by
deceit, by lies, by torment of the body and the spirit, by the threat of
torment to others well loved, or by the sheer terror of his presence,
Melkor ever sought to force the Incarnate that fell into his power, or
came within his reach, to speak and to tell him all that he would know.
But his own Lie begot an endless progeny of lies.

By this means he has destroyed many, he has caused treacheries untold,
and he has gained knowledge of secrets to his great advantage and the
undoing of his enemies. But this is not by entering the mind, or by
reading it as it is, in its despite. Nay, for great though the knowledge
that he gained, behind the words (even of those in fear and torment)
dwells ever the *sáma* inviolable: the words are not in it, though they
may proceed from it (as cries from behind a locked door); they must be
judged and assessed for what truth may be in them. Therefore, the Liar
says that all words are lies: all things that he hears are threaded
through with deceit, with evasions, hidden meanings, and hate. In this
vast network he himself enmeshed struggles and rages, gnawed by
suspicion, doubt, and fear. Not so would it have been, if he could have
broken the barrier, and seen the heart as it is in its truth unveiled.

If we speak last of the "folly" of Manwë and the weakness and unwariness
of the Valar, let us beware how we judge. In the histories, indeed, we
may be amazed and grieved to read how (seemingly) Melkor deceived and
cozened others, and how even Manwë appears at times almost a simpleton
compared with him: as if a kind but unwise father were treating a
wayward child who would assuredly in time perceive the error of his
ways. Whereas we, looking on and knowing the outcome, see now that
Melkor knew well the error of his ways, but was fixed in them by hate
and pride beyond return. He could read the mind of Manwë, for the door
was open; but his own mind was false and even if the door seemed open,
there were doors of iron within closed for ever.

How otherwise would you have it? Should Manwë and the Valar meet secrecy
with subterfuge, treachery with falsehood, lies with more lies? If
Melkor would usurp their rights, should they deny his? Can hate overcome
hate? Nay, Manwë was wiser; or being ever open to Eru he did His will,
which is more than wisdom. He was ever open because he had nothing to
conceal, no thought that it was harmful for any to know, if they could
comprehend it. Indeed Melkor knew his will without questioning it; and
he knew that Manwë was bound by the commands and injunctions of Eru, and
would do this or abstain from that in accordance with them, always, even
knowing that Melkor []{#calibre_link-1752 aria-label="216"
role="doc-pagebreak"}would break them as it suited his purpose. Thus the
merciless will ever count on mercy, and the liars make use of truth; for
if mercy and truth are withheld from the cruel and the lying, they have
ceased to be honoured.[^400]

Manwë could not by duress attempt to compel Melkor to reveal his thought
and purposes, or (if he used words) to speak the truth. If he spoke and
said: *this is true*, he must be believed until proved false; if he
said: *this I will do*, *as you bid*, he must be allowed the opportunity
to fulfill his promise.[^401]

The force and restraint that were used upon Melkor by the united power
of all the Valar, were not used to extort confession (which was
needless); nor to compel him to reveal his thought (which was unlawful,
even if not vain). He was made captive as a punishment for his evil
deeds, under the authority of the King. So we may say; but it were
better said that he was deprived for a term, fixed by promise, of his
power to act, so that he might halt and consider himself, and have thus
the only chance that mercy could contrive of repentance and amendment.
For the healing of Arda indeed, but for his own healing also. Melkor had
the right to exist, and the right to act and use his powers. Manwë had
the authority to rule and to order the world, so far as he could, for
the well-being of the Eruhíni; but if Melkor would repent and return to
the allegiance of Eru, he must be given his freedom again. He could not
be enslaved, or denied his part. The office of the Elder King was to
retain all his subjects in the allegiance of Eru, or to bring them back
to it, and in that allegiance to leave them free.

Therefore not until the last, and not then except by the express command
of Eru and by His power, was Melkor thrown utterly down and deprived for
ever of all power to do or to undo.

Who among the Eldar hold that the captivity of Melkor in Mandos (which
was achieved by force) was either unwise or unlawful? Yet the resolve to
assault Melkor, not merely to withstand him, to meet violence with wrath
to the peril of Arda, was taken by Manwë only with reluctance. And
consider: what good in this case did even the lawful use of force
accomplish? It removed him for a while and relieved Middle-earth from
the pressure of his malice, but it did not uproot his evil, for it could
not do so. Unless, maybe, Melkor had indeed []{#calibre_link-1753
aria-label="217" role="doc-pagebreak"}repented.[^402] But he did not
repent, and in humiliation he became more obdurate: more subtle in his
deceits, more cunning in his lies, crueller and more dastardly in his
revenge. The weakest and most imprudent of all the actions of Manwë, as
it seems to many, was the release of Melkor from captivity. From this
came the greatest loss and harm: the death of the Trees, and the exile
and the anguish of the Noldor. Yet through this suffering there came
also, as maybe in no other way could it have come, the victory of the
Elder Days: the downfall of Angband and the last overthrow of Melkor.

Who then can say with assurance that if Melkor had been held in bond
less evil would have followed? Even in his diminishment the power of
Melkor is beyond our calculation. Yet some ruinous outburst of his
despair is not the worst that might have befallen. The release was
according to the promise of Manwë. If Manwë had broken this promise for
his own purposes, even though still intending "good", he would have
taken a step upon the paths of Melkor. That is a perilous step. In that
hour and act he would have ceased to be the vice-gerent of the One,
becoming but a king who takes advantage over a rival whom he has
conquered by force. Would we then have the sorrows that indeed befell;
or would we have the Elder King lose his honour, and so pass, maybe, to
a world rent between two proud lords striving for the throne? Of this we
may be sure, we children of small strength: any one of the Valar might
have taken the paths of Melkor and become like him: one was
enough.[]{#calibre_link-1754 aria-label="218"

::: ext
Among the papers associated with the c. 1968 *Shibboleth of Fëanor*
(published in part in *The Peoples of Middle-earth*), located now
between the final typescript page of the essay proper and the first of
the manuscript pages concerning the names of the sons of Fëanor and the
legend of the death of his youngest son (cf. XII:352 ff.), is a single,
apparently unrelated but closely contemporary typescript sheet. It is
the beginning of what once may (or would) have been a substantial essay
on the Common Eldarin root GOR and its descendants, which Tolkien has
titled in ink with its Quenya derivative: "*óre*"; and numbered "1".

This text has been previously published, in a somewhat different form,
in *Vinyar Tengwar* 41 (2000).

Órë
:::

Common Eldarin GOR: Quenya *or*, Telerin *or*, Sindarin *gor*;
associated with Common Eldarin √OR in Quenya and Telerin,[^403] but
probably not in Common Eldarin semantically connected. Nearest to the
original sense is 'warn', but (a) it did not refer only to dangers,
evils, or difficulties ahead; and (b) though it could be used of the
influence of one person upon another by visible or audible means (words
or signs) -- in which case 'counsel' was nearer to its sense -- this was
not its chief use. This can best be explained by consideration of its
principal derivative. This was in Common Eldarin \**gōrē*: Quenya *órë*,
Telerin *ōrë*, Sindarin *gûr*.

Quenya *órë* is glossed in *The Lord of the Rings* (III 401)[^404]
'heart (inner mind)'. But although it is used frequently in the *LR* in
the []{#calibre_link-1757 aria-label="221" role="doc-pagebreak"}phrase
"my heart tells me",[^405] translating Quenya *órenya quete nin*,
Telerin *ōre nia pete nin*, Sindarin *guren bêd enni*, 'heart' is not
suitable, except in brevity, since *órë* does not correspond in sense to
any of the English confused uses of "heart": memory, reflection;
courage, good spirits; emotion, feelings, tender, kind or generous
impulses (uncontrolled by, or opposed to the judgements of reason).

What the *órë* was for Elvish thought and speech, and the nature of its
counsels -- it says, and so advises, but is never represented as
commanding -- requires for its understanding a brief account of Eldarin
thought on the matter. For this purpose the question whether this
thought has any validity as judged by human philosophy or psychology,
present or past, is of no importance; nor do we need to consider whether
Elvish minds differed in their faculties and their relation with their
bodies.

The Elves thought there was no fundamental difference in the given
faculties; but that for reasons of the separate history of Elves and Men
they were differently used. Above all the difference of their bodies,
which were nonetheless of the same structure, had a marked effect: the
human body was (or had become) more easily injured or destroyed, and was
in any case doomed to decay by age and to die, with or without the will
to do so, after a brief time. This imported into human thought and
feeling "haste": all desires of the mind and the body were far more
imperious in Men than in Elves: peace, patience, and even full enjoyment
of present good were greatly lessened in Men. By an irony of their fate,
though their personal expectation of it was brief, Men were always
thinking of the future, more often with hope than dread, though their
actual experience gave little reason for the hope. By a similar irony
the Elves, whose expectation of the future was indefinite -- though
before them, however far off, loomed the shadow of an End -- were ever
more and more involved in the past, and in regret -- though their
memories were in fact laden with sorrows. Men, they said, certainly
possessed (or had possessed) *óre*; but owing to the "haste" spoken of
above they paid little attention to it. And there was another reason
more dark (connected the Elves thought with human "death"): the *órë* of
Men was open to evil counsel, and was not safe to trust.[^406][^407]

typescript ends at the bottom of the page. If any continuation of this
typescript text ever existed, it is apparently no longer extant. There
are, however, manuscript pages among Tolkien's linguistic papers
containing what is apparently draft material not long preceding this
typescript, that may give some indication of how that more finished text
may have continued. This group of manuscript notes is written on both
sides of three sheets of Allen & Unwin publication notices, variously
dated 12th January or 9th February, 1968 (providing a *terminus a quo*
for these notes). These were written very hastily, and the handwriting
is in places exceedingly difficult of interpretation, even to Tolkien,
who has, here and there, and more or less tentatively, glossed his own
handwriting.
:::

*órë* in nontechnical language, glossed 'heart, inner mind', nearest
equivalent of 'heart' in our application to *feelings*, or *emotions*
(courage, fear, hope, pity, etc.) including baneful ones. But it is also
used more vaguely of things arising in the mind or entering the mind
(*sanar*) which the Eldar regarded as sometimes the result of deep
reflection (often proceeding in sleep) and sometimes of actual messages
or influences on the mind -- from other minds, including the greater
minds of the Valar and so *indirectly* from Eru.[^408] (So at this
period it was supposed Eru even "spoke" directly to his Children.)[^409]
Hence the frequent expression *órenya quete nin* = "my heart tells me"
used of some deep feelings (to be trusted) that some course of action
etc. is to be \[?approved\] or \[?\] will happen \[??\]. This in Quenya
was often associated with √*or-* 'up/-rise' as if it were 'arising' =
things that arise and come up into the *sanar*, disturbing or colouring
or warning it, and often actively determining its judgement, *nāmie* 'a
single judgement or desire' (*sanwe* 'thought' \> *nāma* 'a judgement or
desire' \> *indo* 'resolve' or 'will' \> action), but it is probably
another case of lost *h*.

'Mind' is *sanar* (for 'thinker'): of which *indo* 'will' was regarded
either as a part or as a function of *sanar*.

Common Eldarin √HOR = 'urge, impel, move' but only of "mental" impulse;
it differs from √NID in having no reference to physical action or
force.[^410]

::: ext
[]{#calibre_link-1758 aria-label="223" role="doc-pagebreak"}*(h)ore nin
karitas* = "I feel an urge/wish/desire to do it".

*ore nin karitas nō* (but) *namin alasaila* = 'I would like / feel moved
to do so but judge it unwise'.

*ōrenya quēta nin* = "my heart is saying to me".
:::

Mind, 'reflector, thinker' = Q. *sanar*; 'will' = *indo*;
'(pre)monition' = *óre*.[^411]

Emotions are divided into two "intertwined" things:

1\) physical impulses provided by the *body*, for its preservation,
pleasure, propagation, physical fear, desire, hunger, thirst, sexual
desire, the physical side of love when the "wedding" of *hröa* and *fëa*
was most close, etc.

2\) impulses arising in the *fëa*, either from its own nature or as
affected by horror, love/pity/\[??\], anger, hate; hate being a crucial
case. It was in later Eldarin history a product of pride/self-love and
emotion of rejection (or most corrupt, revenge) on those opposing one's
will or desire; but there was a real "hate" far more impersonal,
affecting the *fëa* only as one of animosity, of things that were evil,
"against Eru", destructive of other things, especially living
things.[^412]

The Eldar thought[^413] that some disaster, perhaps even amounting to a
"change of the world" (sc. something that affected all its later
history), had befallen Men which altered their nature, especially with
regard to "death". But of this Men, not even the Atani with whom they
became closely associated, could never speak more clearly than to refer
to "the shadow behind us" or "the dark we have fled from". There exists
however a curious document called the "Debate of Finrod and
Andreth".[^414] Finrod was one of the Noldorin Kings known as *Firindil*
or *Atandil '*friend of Men' most interested in them or sympathetic.
Andreth was a woman, a 'wise-woman' of the Atani who it would appear had
loved and been loved by his brother Eignor ('sharp flame') \[Aegnor in
the *Athrabeth*\], but had (as Andreth thought) finally rejected her as
of an inferior race. From this debate it would appear that Andreth
believed that death (and especially the fear of it) had come upon Men as
a punishment or result of some disaster -- rebellion against Eru the
Eldar guessed; and that there had not been any original intention that
Men should be brief or fleeting. This document appears to have been
actually of Mannish origin probably deriving from Andreth herself.

[]{#calibre_link-1759 aria-label="224" role="doc-pagebreak"}For (as far
as we can now judge) \[from\] the legends (mainly of Elvish origin
probably, though coming down to us through Men) it would seem clear that
Men were not intended to have Elvish longevity, limited only by the life
of the Earth or its endurance as a habitable place for incarnates. They
were *privileged*, the Elves would have said, to have passed with free
will out of the physical world and time (the circles of the world), but
after a much greater life-span than now most actually possessed. The
life of the Númenóreans before their fall (the 2^nd^ fall of Man?) was
thus not so much a special gift as a restoration of what should have
been the common inheritance of Men, \[to live\] for 200--300 years.
Aragorn claimed to be the last of the Númenóreans.[^415] The "disaster"
the Elves thus suspected was some rebellion against Eru taking \[the\]
form of accepting Melkor as God.[^416] One consequence of this was that
the *fëa* was \[?impaired\] and Melkor had claim upon those who had
rebelled against him and sought the protection of Eru, and access to
\[??\] *óre* which \[?amazed??\] but were \[?useless\] and only the
wisest of Men could distinguish between \[?his\] evil promptings and the
true *óre*.

::: ext
Despite the difficulty of the end of this passage, enough is legible
that its meaning seems clear: through their acceptance of him as God,
Melkor gained access to the *órë* of Men, so that only the wisest of Men
could distinguish between the uncorrupted counsel of the *órë* and the
evil promptings of Melkor. Cf. the statement in the typescript text that
"the *órë* of Men was open to evil counsel, and was not safe to trust".
:::

The Elves distinguished between the *fëa* (\< \**phayā*) as
'spirit/soul' and *hröa* (\< \**srawā*) 'body'. To the *fëa*
\[?primarily\] they attributed *sanar* 'the mind' which functions in
part with the will *indo* derived from judgements of the *sanar* based
on evidence brought to it by the senses or experiences but also by the
*órë*. This was held to be a power or function of the 'inner mind'
...[^417]

Some time c. 1968 (much of the text presented here is written on the
backs of printed Allen & Unwin reprint notices dated 12^th^ Jan. 1968),
Tolkien turned to considerations of two Quenya words encountered and
glossed in *The Lord of the Rings*: *ambar* 'world' and *umbar* 'fate';
and of their precise meanings and etymological and semantic
relationship. Amidst a linguistic discussion of certain points of Elvish
phonology, Tolkien cited the Eldarin base MBAR underlying both these
Quenya words, as well as the related Sindarin forms *amar* 'world' and
*amarth* 'fate':
:::

MBAR: basically 'settle, establish' but with a considerable semantic
development, being especially applied to 'settlement', sc. the settling
of a place, occupation (permanently) and ordering of a region as a
"home" (of a family or people) \> to erect (permanent) buildings,
dwellings?[^418]

::: ext
Tolkien goes on to cite various derivatives of this base, including:
:::

Quenya and Telerin *ambar*, Sindarin *amar* 'world', 'the great
habitation'.

::: ext
Beneath these glosses he added a note of clarification:
:::

The full implications of this word cannot be understood without
reference to Eldarin views and ideas concerning "fate" and "free will".
(See note on these points.) The sense 'world' -- applied usually to this
Earth -- is mainly derived from sense 'settlement': "the great
[]{#calibre_link-1763 aria-label="228" role="doc-pagebreak"}habitation"
(οἰκουμένη)[^419] as "home of speaking creatures" esp. Elves and Men.
(*ambar* 'world' differed from *Arda* in reference. *Arda* meant 'realm'
& was this earth as the *realm* ruled by Manwë (the Elder King)
vice-regent of Eru, for benefit of the Children of Eru.) But though
*mbar-* was naturally mostly used of the activities and purposes of
rational creatures, it was not limited to these. It thus could refer to
the conditions and established (physical) processes of the Earth (as
established at its Creation directly or mediately by Eru), which was
part of Eä, the Universe; and so approached in some uses the sense
'Fate', according to Eldarin thought on the subject. Thus Q.
*ambarmenië* 'the way of the world' ("world" by the way never meant
"people"), the fixed, and by "creatures" unalterable, conditions in
which they lived.

::: ext
Then, a little further on in this discussion of derivatives of MBAR,
Tolkien cites:
:::

Sindarin *amarth* 'Fate'. This sense is an application of the basic
sense, augmented by its formation, of *mbar*: 'permanent
establishment/order'; 'Fate' especially (when applied to the future):
sc. the order and conditions of the *physical* world (or of Eä in
general) as far as established and pre-ordained at Creation, and that
part of this ordained order which affected an individual with a *will*,
as being immutable by his personal will.

::: ext
The "note on these points" that Tolkien refers to here in connection
with fate and free will arose in an earlier version of this same
discussion of certain strictly linguistic points, beginning on a sheet
which Tolkien subsequently titled "Fate" (after bracketing the
discussion of MBAR and striking out the more strictly linguistic
discussion that preceded it), and continuing on for four more pages, the
first of which Tolkien titled "Fate and Free Will". The text begins in a
clear hand in black nib-pen, with various notes and alterations made in
blue ball-point pen, but this ends half-way down the second page, where
Tolkien switched to pencil and began scrawling very hastily through the
third page. Fortunately, on the fourth page Tolkien recapitulated, in
blue ball-point pen and a much more careful hand, (nearly) all that he
had written so hastily before. To this he added some footnotes in red
ball-point pen. A final very difficult and faint paragraph was added in
light pencil.

I give here the reading of the second version, which for the most part
follows the first version very closely, but interpolate one
[]{#calibre_link-1764 aria-label="229" role="doc-pagebreak"}significant
paragraph (here set in square brackets) of the first version that is
lacking in the second into the body of the text.

This text was previously published in a slightly different editorial
form in *Tolkien Studies* vol. VI (2009). Ellipses indicate the omission
of more strictly linguistic or otherwise technical passages.
:::

MBAR 'settle, establish' (hence also, settle a place, settle in a place,
establish one's home) also to erect (permanent buildings, dwellings,
etc.); extended form *![m.](images/000010.jpg){.middle}barat* with
greater intensity. From this was derived S. *barad* 'tower' (not of a
tall slender building, but in the sense of the Tower of London) great
permanent building of defensive strength, as in *Barad-dûr*.[^420] The
Quenya form would have been \**marto* ... but this word was lost and
generally replaced by \**ostō* \> *osto*, S. *ost* (as seen in
*os(t)giliath*).[^421] Common Eldarin
\**![m.](images/000010.jpg){.middle}bar'tă* 'permanent establishment' \>
*fate* of the world in general as, or as far as, established and
pre-ordained from creation; and that part of this "fate" which affected
an individual person, and not open to modification by his free
will.[^422]

In Q. \* *![m.](images/000010.jpg){.middle}bar'tă* \> *umbart-* \>
*umbar* (genitive *umbarto*) 'Fate' ... in S. *amarth* ... The word from
the simple stem *mbar-* ... was \**ambara* 'establishment', Q. *ambar*
'the world', T. *ambar*, S. \**amar* (not found).

[]{#calibre_link-1765 aria-label="230" role="doc-pagebreak"}This was to
the Eldar more obviously related to \**ṃbar'ta* than we might feel it to
be, since "fate" so far as they recognized it was conceived as a much
more physical obstacle to will.

They would not have denied that (say) a man was (may have been) "fated"
to meet an enemy of his at a certain time and place, but they would have
denied that he was "fated" then to speak to him in terms of hatred, or
to slay him. "Will" at a certain grade must enter into many of the
complex motions leading to a meeting of persons; but the Eldar held that
only those efforts of "will" were "free" which were directed to a fully
*aware purpose*. On a journey a man may turn aside, choosing this or
that way -- e.g. to avoid a marsh, or a steep hill -- but this decision
is mostly intuitive or half-conscious (as that of an irrational animal)
and has only an immediate object of easing his journey. His setting-out
may have been a free decision, to achieve some object,[^423] but his
actual course was largely under *physical* direction -- and it *might
have* led to/or missed a meeting of importance. It was this aspect of
"chance" that was included in *umbar*. See L.R. III p. 360: "a
chance-meeting as we say in Middle-earth".[^424] That was said by
Gandalf of his meeting with Thorin in Bree, which led to the visit to
Bilbo. For this "chance", not purposed or even thought of by either
Thorin or Gandalf, made contact with Gandalf's great "will", and his
fixed purpose and designs for the protection of the NW frontiers against
the power of Sauron. If Gandalf had been different in character, or if
he had not seized the opportunity, the "chance" would, as it were, have
failed to "go off" (misfired). Gandalf was not "fated" to act as he did
then. (Indeed his actions were most odd, idiosyncratic, and
unexpectable: Gandalf was a powerful "free will" let loose, as it were,
among the physical "chances" of the world.)[^425]

*Umbar* thus relates to the net-work of "chances" (largely physical)
which is, or is not, used by rational persons with "free will". That
aspect of things which *we* might include in Fate -- the "determination"
that we each carry about with us in our given created character (which
later acts and experience may modify but not fundamentally change) was
*not* included in *Umbar* by the Eldar; who said that if it was in any
way similar it was on a different "plane". But the ultimate problem of
Free Will in its relation to the *Foreknowledge* of a Designer
[]{#calibre_link-1766 aria-label="231" role="doc-pagebreak"}(both of the
plane of *Umbar* and of the *Mind* and the blending of both in Incarnate
Mind), Eru, "the Author of the Great Tale", was of course not resolved
by the Eldar.

\[But they would have said it is the continual clash of *umbar*, the
"chances" of *ambar* as a fixed arrangement which continues to work out
inevitably (except only for "miracle": a direct or mediate intervention
of Eru, from *outside* *umbar* and *ambar*), and purposeful *will* that
\[?ramifies\] a story or tale (as an excerpt from the total drama of
which Eru is the Author or as that Drama itself). Until the appearance
of *Will* all is mere preparation, interesting only on a quite different
& lower plane: like mathematics or observing the physical events of the
world or in a similar way the workings of a machine. *Will* first
appeared with the Ainur/Valar, but *except for Melkor* and those he
dominated their wills being in accord with Eru effected little change in
*Ambar* or deflected *Umbar*.\][^426]

They said that, though this likeness is only a "likeness", not an
equation, the nearest experience of the Incarnates to this problem is to
be found in the author of a tale. The author is not in the tale in one
sense, yet it all proceeds from him (and what was in him), so that he is
present all the time.[^427] Now while composing the *tale* he may have
certain general designs (the plot for instance), and he may have a clear
conception of the character (independent of the particular tale) of each
feigned actor. But those are the limits of his "foreknowledge". Many
authors have recorded the feeling that one of their actors "comes alive"
as it were, and does things that were not foreseen at all at the outset
and may modify in a small or even large way the process of the tale
thereafter. All such unforeseen actions or events are, however, taken up
to become integral parts of the tale when finally concluded. Now when
that has been done, then the author's "foreknowledge" is complete, and
nothing can happen, be said, or done, that he does not know of and will
or allow to be. Even so, some of the Eldarin philosophers ventured to
say, it was with Eru.

::: ext
The note originally ended here, about a third of the way down the page;
but at a later point (judging by the change of writing implement),
Tolkien added one more very rough and faint paragraph (readings marked
here as uncertain are for the most part very uncertain indeed),
apparently applying the simile of "the author of a tale" to his
cosmogonic myth:[^428]
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1767 aria-label="232" role="doc-pagebreak"}Let the
Music of Ainur \[be an\] ancient legend from Valinórean days. First
stage: the music or "concert" of voices and instruments -- Eru takes up
alterations by their created wills ("good" or bad) and adds of His own.
Second stage: the theme now transformed is made into a Tale and
presented as visible drama to the Ainur, bounded but great. Eru had not
\[?complete\] foreknowledge, but \[?after it His\] foreknowledge was
complete to the smallest detail -- but He did not reveal it all. He
veiled the latter part from the eyes of the Valar who were to be actors.

::: ext
The Knowledge of the Valar; or Elvish ideas and theories concerned with
them
:::

\[The Valar\] remained in direct contact with Eru, though they, as far
as the legends go, usually "addressed" Him through Manwë the Elder King.
No doubt these legends are somatomorphic[^429] (sc. almost as
anthropomorphic as are our own legends or imagination), and most Elves,
when speaking of Manwë appealing to Eru or having converse with Him,
imagined him as a figure, even more majestic than one of their own
ancient kings, standing in attitude of prayer or supplication to the
Valar.[^430] By *nature* one of the Valar, or of those of the prime
order of created spirits to which they belonged, would *be* in the
presence of Eru only by presenting themselves in thought. The Eldar, and
still less the Elves of Middle-earth (and again still less Men,
especially those who had no contact with Elves or shunned it), knew
little of such things; but they believed that "direct" resort to Eru was
not allowed to them, or at least not expected of them, except in gravest
emergency. The Valar were themselves "on trial" -- an
[]{#calibre_link-1769 aria-label="234" role="doc-pagebreak"}aspect of
the mystery of "free will" in created intelligences. They had a
sufficient knowledge of the will of Eru and his "design" to undertake
the responsibility of guiding its development by means of the great
prowess given to them and according to their own reason and
intelligence.

There was, however, one element in the Design of Eru that remained a
mystery: the Children of Eru, Elves and Men, the Incarnate. These were
said to have been an *addition* made by Eru Himself *after* the
Revelation to the primal spirits of the Great Design. They were *not*
subject to the subcreative activities of the Valar, and one of the
purposes of this addition was to provide the Valar with objects of love,
as being in no way their own subject, but having a direct relationship
to Eru Himself, like their own but different from it. They were, or were
to be, thus "other" than the Valar, independent creations of His love,
and so objects for their reverence and true (entirely unselfregarding)
love. Another purpose they had, which remained a mystery to the Valar,
was to complete the Design by "healing" the hurts which it suffered, and
so ultimately not to recover "Arda Unmarred" (that is the world as it
would have been if Evil had never appeared), but the far greater thing
"Arda Healed".[^431]

With regard to Elves and Men Eru had made one absolute prohibition: the
Valar were *not to attempt* to dominate the Children (even for what
might seem to the Valar to be their good), neither by force nor fear nor
pain, nor even by the awe and reverence that their wisdom and
overwhelming majesty might inspire if fully revealed. The minds of the
Children were not open to the Valar (except by the free will of the
Children), and could not be invaded or violated by the Valar except with
disastrous consequences: their breaking and enslaving, and the
substitution in them of the dominating Vala as a God in place of
Eru.[^432]

It was for this reason that the Valar adopted the *fanar*;[^433] but
they did this also out of the love and reverence for the Children that
they conceived when Eru first revealed to them His idea of them. From
that time onwards they had ever looked and longed for the coming of
Elves and Men into the world.

The Valar -- all save one, Melkor -- obeyed this prohibition by Eru,
[]{#calibre_link-857 aria-label="235" role="doc-pagebreak"}according to
their wisdom.[^434] But there was thus introduced an element of
uncertainty into all their operations after the Coming of the Elves and
Men. The wills and desires and the resultant deeds of the Elves remained
forever in some measure unpredictable, and their minds not always open
to admonition and instruction that was not (as was forbidden) issued as
commands supported by latent power. This was even more evident in the
case of Men, either by their nature, or by their early subjection to the
lies of Melkor, or by both. It was also held by some that the Valar had
even earlier failed in their "trials" when wearying of their destructive
war with Melkor they removed into the West, which was first intended to
be a fortress whence they might issue to renew the War, but became a
Paradise of peace, while Middle-earth was corrupted and darkened by
Melkor, long unopposed. The obduracy of Men and the great evils and
injuries which they inflicted upon themselves, and also, as their power
increased, upon other creatures and even upon the world itself, was thus
in part attributable to the Valar. -- not to their wilful revolt and
pride, but to *mistakes* which were not by design intended to oppose the
will of Eru, though they revealed a failure in understanding of His
purposes and in confidence in Him.

This text is located in Tolkien's linguistic papers with a group of
etymological notes that Tolkien has dated to Sep. 1957. Further
supporting the date of this text to 1957 is the use of the word *hrondo*
'body', whereas this form was abandoned by 1959 for *hröa* (see
X:141--3, 209, 304). It is written in an increasingly hasty hand in
black nib-pen.

This text was first published in slightly different form in *Parma
Eldalamberon* 17 (2007), pp. 124--5.
:::

Eldar did not confound ordinary "breath" of the lungs with "spirit". The
particular spirit indwelling in a body they called *fëa* \[\<
\**fáyā*\]; spirit in general as a kind of being they called *fairë.*
These terms were chiefly applied to the spirits or "souls" of Elves (and
Men); since though these were held to be of a *similar* sort to those of
the *máyar* (and Valar), they were not identical in nature: it was part
of the nature of a *fëa* to desire to dwell in a body (*hrondo*), and by
that mediary or instrument to operate upon the physical world; and the
*fëa* did not and could not make its own body, according to its desire,
or conception of itself, but could only modify its given or appointed
*hrondo* by indwelling (as a living person may modify a house, filling
it with a sense of his own personality, even if no visible physical
alterations are made in its shape).

But the Eldar held that "spirits", the more as they had more native
[]{#calibre_link-845 aria-label="237" role="doc-pagebreak"}inherent
power, could *emit* their influence to make contact with or act upon
things exterior to themselves: primarily upon other spirits, or other
incarnate persons (via their *fëar*), but also in the case of great
spirits (such as the Valar or greater *máyar*) directly upon physical
things without the mediacy of bodies normally necessary in the case of
"*fairondi*" or incarnates. To describe this they used (but by
deliberate symbolism -- taken e.g. from such cases as their breathing
upon a cold or frosted surface, which was then melted) the √*thū*- (or
√*sū*). In addition Manwë, the most powerful spirit in Arda, in this
respect was Lord of Air and Winds, and the winds were in primitive
Eldarin thought to be especially his emission of power for himself.
Hence \**th![ū\'](images/000007.jpg){.middle}lē* 'blowing forth' was
used = 'spirit' in this special sense: the emission of power (of will or
desire) from a spirit. \[?Formulated\] on \**sū* chiefly were Q *sūre*
*(ĭ)*, S *sūl.* Cf. *Manwë Sūlimo* or *Thūrimo*, *thūle*, S *Thū.*

The Eldar still hold that *winds* may be \[?such\] and not all are
naturally \[?made\] sc. that the air is \[?easily\] disturbed by direct
will or \[?alternatively\] that \[?the?\] of such power may seem to
incarnates like a wind.

This text is written in a clear hand in black nib-pen on three sides of
two sheets of Oxford examination paper. It was gathered by Tolkien with
"Primal Impulse" (chap. II of part two of this book), but is presented
here separately. There are two pieces of internal evidence that have
bearing on its date. First is the use of the word *hrondo* 'body',
whereas this form was abandoned by 1958 for *hröa* (see X:141--3, 209,
304). Second in the apparently inadvertent reference to the language
"N." (that is, Noldorin) when citing the form *gwae*; this suggests that
the change whereby Sindarin came to be the name of the Welsh-like Elvish
language formerly and for long called Noldorin, was still relatively
recent. I would therefore date this text to no later than 1957.

::: ext
Concerning "Spirit"
:::

The Eldar retained, even after their dwelling in Aman and their
instruction by the Valar, many traces in their language of more
primitive thought and theory.

At no time did they confuse, or identify, ordinary "breath" of the
lungs, with "spirit". (They were indeed slow in arriving at the
[]{#calibre_link-1770 aria-label="238" role="doc-pagebreak"}conception
of a difference between "spirit" and "body" in their own case.) But they
were much impressed by wind and all movements of air, especially as
accompanying the passage of things going with speed, and (as they
declared) the coming and going of other beings than themselves. The
words for wind and motions of the air were therefore also used of, or
modified and applied in use to, manifestations of "spirit", or
incorporeal presences and operations.

The chief ancient stems concerned were: √*thū*/*thus-* 'blow, cause an
air movement': √*sū*/*sur* 'blow, move with audible sound (of air)': the
latter being seldom applied except to actual wind. The two stems owing
to tendency in Quenya of *s*/*r* and *s*/*th* to coalesce became much
confused. Q. *thussë*, *sussë* 'puff (of air)' (S. *thus*, *thos*);
*súrë* (\**sūri*) 'wind', &c. are only used of wind. But Q. *thúlë*
usually equals '(movement of) spirit', whence S. *súl* = 'wind'; and
*thû* = 'movement of spirit' (*thus-*?)[^435]. In the title *Manwë
Thúlimo*/*Súrimo*, later *Súlimo*, we see the blending.

Later the Eldar used the word Q. *fëa* (\**phắyā*, from stem √*phay*)
for the particular spirit indwelling in a given body or *hrondo*. In
Sindarin we have *fân* (\**phănā*) and *rhond*, *rhonn*. "Spirit" of
this kind,[^436] as a variety or mode of being was called in Q. *fairë*
(\**phai-rĭ*), in S. *faen* (\**phainĭ*) = 'vapour'.

Also \**wā*, \**swā*, \**wa-wa*, \**swa-swa*, \**swar*, etc. as "echoic"
representations of sound of wind. Q. *hwá*; *hwarwa* 'violent wind'. N.
*gwae* is apparently \< \**wā-yo* \> *gwoe* \> *gwae*. But *gwaew* \<
\**wagmē*, Q. *vangw*ë 'storm'.

These seem based on quite different analogies. √*pha*/*phay*/*phan*
appear in origin to have referred to *exhalations*, as mists upon water
or steams and the like. Cf. Q. *fanya* 'cloud' (S. *fein*, *fain*
'pallid, white', diaphanous), *fanwë* 'vapour, steam'.[^437][^438]

In Quenya these terms: *fëa*, *fairë* were chiefly applied to the
spirits or "souls" of Incarnates (Elves and Men); since though these
were held to be of a similar mode of being to the Ainur, Valar, and
Máyar,[^439] []{#calibre_link-1771 aria-label="239"
role="doc-pagebreak"}they were *not* identical in nature. They had no
power, or very little power, of direct action upon other things or
beings, and it was an important aspect of the nature of a *fëa* to
desire to dwell in a body (*hrondo*), and by that mediacy or instrument
to operate upon the *physical* world. Also, since the *fëa* was given a
body at once, upon its entry into Eä, it had no experience or memory of
separate existence. Death (that is separation from its body) was
therefore for it an unnatural and unhappy condition.[^440] Also, a *fëa*
did not and could not make for itself any body, according either to its
nature or its conception of itself, though it could and did modify and
inspire its *hrondo* by indwelling -- somewhat as a living person may
modify and fill with a sense of its personality a house that it lives in
long, even if it make no visible alteration in the shape of its
dwelling. Whereas a Máya's normal experience was "disembodied"; its
experience began before Eä, it had far more power over physical things,
a far clearer and more accurate conception of itself -- it could
therefore "array" itself in forms of its own choosing. These might be
only "phantoms", as were the appearances of disembodied *fëar*; but not
necessarily so. By a "phantom" (Q. *níma* or *nimulë*; S. *nîf*, *nivol*
= lit. a 'seeming') was meant an appearance having no existence in the
*physical* world, existing only as a conception/memory/picture in one
mind, and more or less accurately transferred direct to another. The
Valar and greater Máyar were held to have made for themselves real
bodies -- ascertainable by Incarnates by all their senses, and occupying
space; though since maintained by their true selves indestructible -- in
the sense that garments may be removed or repaired.

The Eldar believed that "spirits", and the more so as they had greater
inherent native powers, could "emit" their influence to make contact
with or act upon things exterior to themselves: primarily and most
easily upon other spirits, or upon the *fëar* of Incarnates; but also in
the case of the greater Máyar (of whom the Valar were the chief)
directly upon physical things without the mediacy of corporeal
instruments.[^441] [^442]

This direct action upon *things* was held to be quite different from
direct calling of attention from other spirits. The latter was a
*natural operation* within one mode of being, it being of the nature of
spirits to []{#calibre_link-1772 aria-label="240"
role="doc-pagebreak"}be aware of one another. The former was an
exhalation of *dominance* of one mode over another; and according to the
Eldar all exertions of dominance make demands upon those who exert the
power -- something of their "spirit" is expelled, and transferred to the
thing in a lower mode. Hence all tyrants slowly consume themselves, or
transfer their power to things, and can only control it so long as they
can \[?possess or control the thing with its?\] but power is dissipated.
So Morgoth had become in fact *less* powerful than the other Valar, and
much of his native power had passed into things \[??diminished?\] Hence
his malice could live on after his extrusion.

The words used to describe this action or emission of "power" were
derived (apparently) by analogy from emission of breath, and such
physical phenomena as breathing upon frost (which melts). In addition
Manwë, who was held to be Lord of Air and Winds, was the most powerful
of the Valar in this respect, and the most powerful spirit in Arda.

::: ext
Following this text, Tolkien worked out two sentences in Quenya
illustrating Manwë's "spirit in action" (Q. *thúlë*/*súlë*) from afar.
The literal translations following each Quenya sentence are my own:
:::

"And the spirit of Manwë went out[^443] and the servants of Melkor were
stayed"; or "and the hearts of the Eldar heard afar \[?off\] and were
comforted / or obeyed."

*Ar thúlë Manwëo etsurinye ar Eldaron indor turyaner*.[^444]

\["And the spirit of Manwë blew forth and the hearts of the Eldar
obeyed."\]

*Sustane Manwëo súle ten i indo Sindicollo ar he lastane ar
carnes.*[^445]

\["The spirit of Manwë blew unto the heart of Thingol and he listened
and did it."\]

Between these two Quenya sentences, Tolkien provided the following
glosses and derivations:[^446]

This text occupies five sides of six sheets of unlined paper, lettered

√*phan*-. The basic sense of this was 'cover, screen, veil', but it had
a special development in the Eldarin tongues. This was largely due to
what appears to have been its very ancient application to *clouds*,
especially to separate floating clouds as (partial) veils over the blue
sky, or over the sun, moon, or stars. This application of the most
primitive derivative \**phanā* (Q *fana*, S *fân*) was so ancient that
when \**phanā* (or other derivatives) was applied to lesser, handmade,
things this was felt to be a transference from the sense 'cloud', and
words of this group were mainly applied to things of soft textures,
veils, mantles, curtains and the like, of white or pale colours.

In Sindarin *fân* remained the usual word for 'cloud', floating clouds,
or those for a while resting upon or wreathing hills and mountain-top.
The derivative (properly adjectival in form) \**phanyā* became *fain*,
used as an adjective meaning 'dim, dimmed' (applied to dimmed or fading
lights or to things seen in them) or 'filmy, fine-woven etc.' (applied
to things that only partially screened light, such as a canopy
[]{#calibre_link-1775 aria-label="243" role="doc-pagebreak"}of young
still half-transparent leaves, or textures that veiled but only
half-concealed a form). As a noun it was used of vague shapes or
fleeting glimpses, especially of "apparitions" or figures seen in
dreams.

In Quenya, owing to close relations of the Eldar in Valinor with the
Valar and other lesser spirits of their order, *fana* developed a
special sense. It was applied to the visible bodily forms adopted by
these spirits, when they took up their abode on Earth, as the normal
"raiment" of their otherwise invisible being. In these *fanar* they were
seen and known by the Eldar, to whom glimpses of other and more
awe-inspiring manifestations were seldom given. But the Elves of Valinor
asserted that unclad and unveiled the Valar were perceived by some among
them as lights (of different hues) which their eyes could not tolerate;
whereas the Maiar were usually invisible unclad, but their presence was
revealed by their fragrance.[^447] [^448]

The old word *fana* thus became used in Quenya only in this special and
exalted sense: the visible form or "raiment" (which included both the
assumed bodily shape and its vesture) in which a Vala or one of the
lesser angelic spirits, not by nature incarnate, presented itself to
bodily eyes. Since these *fanar* usually appeared "radiant" (in some
degree), as if lit by a light within, the word *fana* acquired in Quenya
an additional sense as 'shining shape', and this addition of radiance
affected other derivatives of the same "base".

*Valar ar Maiar fantaner nassentar fanainen ve quenderinwe koar al
larmar*: (*Nasser ar Kenime Kantar Valaron ar Maiaron*: a preserved
fragment of Quenya lore): "The Valar and Maiar veiled their true-being
in *fanar*, like to Elvish bodies and raiment" from "The Natures and
Visible Shapes of the V. and M."

Thus the word for 'cloud' was in Quenya supplied by the derivative
*fanya* (cf. I 394),[^449] which was no longer used as an adjective. But
this was used only of white clouds, sunlit or moonlit, or of clouds
reflecting sunlight as in the sunset or sunrise, or gilded and silvered
at the edges by moon or sun behind them. The hands of Varda were
[]{#calibre_link-1776 aria-label="244" role="doc-pagebreak"}(like all
her *fana*) of shining white. After the Darkening of Valinor she lifted
them up, palms eastward, in a gesture of rejection,[^450] as she
summoned up in obedience to the decree of Manwë, her spouse, the "Elder
King", the vast mists and shadows that made it impossible for any living
thing to find again the way westward to the shores of Valinor*.* Her
hands are thus compared poetically in "Galadriel's Lament" to clouds --
white and shining still above the rising darkness that swiftly engulfed
the shores and the mountains, and at last her own majestic figure[^451]
upon the summit of Oiolossë.[^452]

This Quenya meaning of *fana* after the coming of the Exiles to
Middle-earth was also assumed by Sindarin *fân*, at first in the
Sindarin as used by the exiled Noldor, and eventually also by the Sindar
themselves, especially those in close contact with the Noldor or
actually mingled with them. No doubt this use aroused in the minds of
the Sindar who had not seen the Valar in their own sacred land of Aman a
mental picture of a majestic figure robed as if in shining cloud seen
far away.[^453] *Fanuilos* was thus a title of, or second name for
Elbereth, made after the coming of the Exiles, and conveyed in full some
such meaning as "bright angelic figure, far away upon *Uilos* (=
Oiolossë)," or "-- angelic figure ever-snow-white (shining afar)".[^454]

Though the Sindar had failed to reach Valinor (and some were embittered
by what they considered their desertion on the Western Shores of
Middle-earth) their hearts were still "westward" and they treasured what
they knew or could learn about the Valar*.* In the far off days of their
"Awaking" they had been visited and protected by Oromë in his *fana* as
a great horseman mounted upon Nahar and bearing his mighty horn, the
*Valaróma.* Their king Elwë, later known as *Elwë Sindikollo* or in
Sindarin form *(Elu) Thingol*, had been one of the three emissaries
borne by Oromë to Valinor to the council of the Valar at which it was
resolved to invite all the Elves who were willing to remove and dwell in
the Far West under the protection of the Valar and out of the reach of
Morgoth. He had thus seen and had converse with the Valar in their most
majestic *fanar.* His wife Melian was one of the lesser spirits of the
same order, a Maia of great beauty and wisdom, so that, at least among
the "wise" of Doriath, much was known about the Valar*.* Varda whom none
of the Sindar had seen []{#calibre_link-1777 aria-label="245"
role="doc-pagebreak"}(save Elwë), was there called *El-bereth* (a name
of the same meaning as Quenya *Elentári*) \['Star-queen'\] ...

The *fanar* of the *Valar* were not "phantoms", but "physical": that is,
they were not "visions" arising to the mind, or implanted there by the
will of a superior mind or spirit, and then projected,[^455] [^456] but
received through the bodily eyes.[^457]

The Valar had a command, great individually, *almost* complete as a
united council, over the physical material of Eä (the material
universe). Their *fanar* which were originally devised out of love for
the "Children of Eru", the Incarnate, whom they were to guard and
counsel, had the properties of the material of which the *köar* (or
bodies) of the Elves (and also of Men) were formed: sc. they were not
transparent, they cast shadows (if their inner luminosity was dimmed);
they could move material objects, and were resisted by these, and
resisted them. These *fanar* were, however, also personal expressions
(in terms suitable to the apprehension of the Incarnate) of their
individual "natures" and functions, and were usually also clad in
vestures of similar purpose.

But it is often mentioned in the legends that certain of the Valar, and
occasionally of the Maiar, "passed over the Sea", and appeared in
Middle-earth. (Notably Oromë, Ulmo, and Yavanna.) The Valar and Maiar
were essentially "spirits", according to Elvish tradition given being
before the making of Eä. They could go where they willed, that is could
be present at once at any point in Eä where they desired to be.[^458]

::: ext
A briefer but related and apparently contemporary note elsewhere in
Tolkien's linguistic papers provides these additional details:
:::

\[Q. *fana*\] was used of the "raiment" or "veils" in which the Valar
presented themselves. These were the *bodily forms* (like those of Elves
and Men), as well as any further vestures, in which the Valar were
[]{#calibre_link-1778 aria-label="246"
role="doc-pagebreak"}self-incarnated. These *fanar* they assumed when
after their demiurgic activities they came and dwelt in *Arda* ('the
Realm'), that is the Earth; and they did so because of their love and
yearning for the "Children of Eru", for whom they were to prepare the
world, and for a time to govern it. The future forms of the bodies of
Elves and Men they knew, though they had no part in their making. In
these forms they presented themselves to the Elves (though they could
assume other and wholly alien shapes), appearing usually as persons of
majestic (but not gigantic) stature.

The Converse of Manwë with Eru\
concerning the death of the Elves and how it might\
be redressed; with the comments of the Eldar added
:::

Manwë spoke to Eru, saying: "Behold! an evil appears in Arda that we did
not look for: Thy First-born Children, whom Thou madest immortal, suffer
now severance of spirit and body. Many of the *fëar* of the Elves in
Middle-earth are now houseless; and even in Aman []{#calibre_link-1780
aria-label="248" role="doc-pagebreak"}there is one. The houseless we
summon to Aman, to keep them from the Darkness, and all who hear our
voice abide here in waiting.

"What further is to be done? Is there no means by which their lives may
be renewed, to follow the courses which Thou hast designed? And what of
the bereaved who mourn those that have gone?"

Eru answered: "Let the houseless be re-housed!"

Manwë asked: "How shall this be done?"

Eru answered: "Let the body that was destroyed be re-made. Or let the
naked *fëa* be re-born as a child."

Manwë said: "Is it Thy will that we should attempt these things? For we
fear to meddle with Thy Children."

Eru answered: "Have I not given to the Valar the rule of Arda, and power
over all the substance thereof, to shape it at their will under My will?
Ye have not been backward in these things. As for My First-born, have ye
not removed great numbers of them to Aman from the Middle-earth in which
I set them?"

Manwë answered: "This we have done, for fear of Melcor,[^459] and with
good intent, though not without misgiving. But to use our power upon the
flesh that Thou hast designed, to house the spirits of Thy Children,
this seems a matter beyond our authority, even were it not beyond our
skill."

Eru said: "I give you authority. The skill ye have already, if ye will
take heed. Look and ye will find that each spirit of My Children
retaineth in itself the full imprint and memory of its former house; and
in its nakedness it is open to you, so that ye may clearly perceive all
that is in it. After this imprint ye may make for it again such a house
in all particulars as it had ere evil befell it. Thus ye may send it
back to the lands of the Living."

Then Manwë asked further: "O Ilúvatar, hast Thou not spoken also of
re-birth? Is that too within our power and authority?"

Eru answered: "It shall be within your authority, but it is not in your
power. Those whom ye judge fit to be re-born, if they desire it and
understand clearly what they incur, ye shall surrender to Me; and I will
consider them."[^460]

Comments
:::

1\. The Valar were troubled, not only because of the case of Finwë and
Míriel but because of the Avari, and of the Sindar; for Middle-earth was
perilous to bodies, and many had died, even before the Eldar came to
Aman. And they discovered that, though those *fëar* that obeyed their
summons were safe from the Darkness, to be naked was
[]{#calibre_link-1781 aria-label="249" role="doc-pagebreak"}against
their nature.[^461] Therefore the Dead were unhappy, not only because
they were bereaved of friends, but because they could do no deed nor
achieve any new design without the body.[^462] Many therefore turned
inwards, brooding upon their injuries, and they were hard to heal.

2\. The Valar feared to meddle with the Children, since they were not in
the design of Eä in which they had assisted. Also Eru had forbidden them
to coerce their wills, daunting their minds by dread of the power of the
Valar, or even amazing them with wonder of their beauty and majesty. But
they deemed that since the rule of Arda was committed them, it was
within their authority to hinder any creature from deeds of evil, or to
restrain it from what might prove hurtful to itself or to others. By
"coercing the will" they understood the domination or enslaving of the
mind of a lesser creature, so that it might say "I will", assenting to
this or that against its true nature and inclination, until it lost,
maybe, the power of choice. But they held it within their authority,
which must otherwise become void in all dealings with those that had
minds and wills, to deny to it, if they could, the means to achieve its
purposes and desires, if these were evil or hurtful. For by the gift of
will, Eru had not guaranteed to any less than Himself that this will
should always be effected, be it good or evil.[^463] And even the lesser
creatures had the power to hinder the deeds of others, and the right to
do so, if they judged the deeds to be wrong, albeit their judgement of
what was evil or hurtful was far less secure than the judgement of the
Valar, who knew clearly (according to their capacity) the will of Eru.
Nonetheless, the removal of the Eldar from Middle-earth went to the
limits of their authority, as they well understood; and not all of the
Valar had believed this to be wise.

3\. It is clear that the Valar had power and skill, among them, to form
from the substance of Arda any thing, however intricate in design, of
which they knew and fully perceived the pattern. But as was seen in the
case of Aulë and the Dwarves they had no power to give free mind and
will to anything that they made. With regard to the Dead, however, the
living mind of the *fëa* already existed, and the Valar had only to make
for it a house in all things the same as the one that it had lost. This
they could now do with the authority of Eru.

4\. Some then asked whether the *fëa* re-housed was the same person as
before the death of the body. It was agreed that it was the same person,
for these reasons. "What means this word *same*?" the loremasters said.
'It means two things: *in all* *respects equivalent*; but also
*identical in history*.'

"With regard to spirits: No *fëa* can be repeated; each proceeds
[]{#calibre_link-1782 aria-label="250" role="doc-pagebreak"}separately
and uniquely from Eru, and so remains for ever separate and unique. It
may indeed resemble some other *fëa* so closely that observers may be
deceived; but it can then only be said to be *like* the other. If it is
said to be the *same* as the other (though this is not said by the
wise), this can only mean that it resembles the other in all features of
its character so closely that the two, unless present together, cannot
be distinguished, save by intimate knowledge of both. We say *by
intimate knowledge*, not meaning knowledge only of the different
histories of these two, but because we hold, and all observation
confirms us, that no two *fëar* are in truth exactly alike or
equivalent.

"With regard to things without life, and to things with life corporeal
only, it may seem that all these also are unique in history, that is in
the Unfolding of Eä and the Tale of Arda. But here two things require
thought. First: 'In what degree things without even life corporeal can
be distinguished as the *same* (or identical) on the one hand, and as
*equivalent* on the other.' Second: 'How does it concern a thing with
life corporeal (still more a person with a life spiritual also), if the
material in which it is embodied is changed, the pattern of the
embodiment being maintained or restored?'

"To speak of things without life. In history, maybe, one quantity of
iron (for example) is not the *same* as any other equal quantity of
iron; for both co-exist in time, occupying different places, and they
will do so while Eä lasts, even though each quantity or aggregation of
iron may be dispersed into smaller quantities. But this difference
concerns IRON only, that is the total of this *nassë* (or material) that
exists in Arda (or in Eä, maybe). For later-made and higher forms,
whether having life (from Eru and his vice-gerents), or the shaping of
art (from minds incarnate), this difference has no importance or
meaning, and all fractions of IRON (or other *nassë*) are in value or
virtue the *same*."[^464] [^465]

[]{#calibre_link-1783 aria-label="251" role="doc-pagebreak"}Thus for all
the purposes of constituting a form that uses (say) IRON in its
embodiment, the substitution of one fraction of IRON for another equal
fraction will have no effect upon life or identity. It is commonly said,
for instance, that two rings (differently shaped by art) are made "of
the same stuff", if they are both made (say) of GOLD. And "same" is
rightly used, when the higher thing that uses lower materials for its
embodiment is considered.

Still more truly is the word "same" used, if we consider things with
life corporeal. For life corporeal consists in a pattern, existing in
itself (from the mind of Eru, directly or mediately), and neither
derived from the *nassi* used in its embodiment, nor imposed by other
living things (as by the art of the Incarnate). Though it may indeed be
part of the nature of the living thing to use certain materials and not
to use others in the development of its pattern.

This is because the living patterns, though conceived as it were outside
Eä, were destined to be realized within Eä (having respect to the
qualities of the *erma* and *nassi* of Eä), and therefore "select" --
not by will or awareness of their own good, but by the nature of the
unfolding pattern, which is to seek realization as near to its primal
and unconditioned form as possible -- those materials by which they may
be "best" realized. "Best", but not perfectly: that is, not in any case
exactly according to the conceived and unrealized pattern. But such
"imperfection" is not an evil, necessarily.[^466] For it does not seem
that Eru designed Eä so that living things should each in their kind
exactly exhibit the primal life-pattern of that kind,[^467] and that all
members of one kind (as, say, beeches) should be exactly alike. Rather
His design is more akin to the Art of the Incarnate, in which the
pattern conceived may be endlessly varied in individual examples, and
according to the chances of materials and conditions in Arda. To
perceive the patterns, and their kinship, through living variation is a
chief delight of those who survey the wealth of the living things of
Arda. Neither is there a []{#calibre_link-1784 aria-label="252"
role="doc-pagebreak"}fast distinction between "kinds" and the variations
of individuals. For some kinds are more akin to others in pattern, and
may seem to be only variations of some older and common pattern. This
the Valar say is how the variety of Arda was indeed achieved: beginning
with a few patterns, and varying these or blending pattern with
pattern.[^468]

Thus it may occur that for a living thing its "proper", that is, its
best, materials are scarce, so that it may be obliged to use these in
different proportions from those which are "proper", or even to use
other materials. If these changes do not actually impair its development
so that it perishes, still its form may be modified; and the
modifications may be thought to be "due" to the *nassi*. But rightly
viewed they are not so. The *nassi* are passive, the living pattern is
active; and though the realization of the pattern may be otherwise than
it would have been with "better" materials, the modified form is due to
the operation of the living upon the unliving.

Another thing which distinguishes the living from the unliving is that
the living employ Time in their realization. In other words it is part
of their nature to "grow", using such material as is needed or is
available to them for their embodiment. So that a living pattern does
not exist fully at any one moment of time (as do unliving patterns); but
is complete only with the completion of its life. It cannot therefore
rightly be seen instantly, and is only imperfectly envisaged even with
the help of memory. Only those who conceived its pattern and whose sight
is not limited to the succession of time can, for instance, see the true
shape of a tree.

We say that unliving things or patterns do "exist fully at any one
instant of time", meaning, for instance, that IRON is always IRON, just
so and nothing more nor less, whenever observed or considered. So long,
that is, as its characteristic inner pattern is maintained. If this is
or could be changed, it would not be IRON, or a portion of IRON,
"growing" and working out the full pattern of IRON according to
iron-nature. It would rather be that iron was changed into something
else, and became another *nassë*, whether by force external applied to
it, or by its own instability. Though in the case of certain *nassi*
that appear "by nature" to be thus "unstable", breaking up or changing
their inner patterns normally under like conditions, it may be thought
that we have an adumbration in a lower order of the normal nature of a
higher order.[^469] For such adumbrations are to be seen in all orders.
Nonetheless they are only "adumbrations" and not the same processes.
Just as the apparent growth of crystals foreshadows but does not
forestall the growth of plants.

[]{#calibre_link-1785 aria-label="253" role="doc-pagebreak"}Some may
say: "But are not many unliving things subject to change without loss of
identity?" We answer: "No. These things are things in name only: that
is, they are distinguished from their surroundings by minds, and not by
their own interior nature. Or they have shapes and individuality derived
also from minds, and imposed upon the unliving material by art."

Thus the Incarnate may distinguish, say, a mountain from the land about
it, giving it a name, such as *Dolmed* \[one of the Blue Mountains\].
But what are the bounds of Dolmed? Some may say "here it begins" or
"here it ends"; but others may say otherwise; and if the bounds are
agreed, it will be by custom or convention of people, not by the nature
of the land. Neither would its bounds in Time be clear, so that one of
the Incarnate living many ages might say "now Dolmed has begun to be" or
"now it has ceased". For this aggregation of materials upon the surface
of Arda has no inner individuality distinguishing it from the adjacent
material. The distinction is applied by minds receiving the impression
of a shape that can be held in memory; and it is by their memory alone
that it is name-worthy.

A face perceived by eyes in the markings on a wall, or in the
weatherings of a rock, or in the discolorations of the Moon, is not a
face in itself, but only for a beholder (and maybe not for all
beholders). Such perceptions are related to Art, and not to the forms
which living things exhibit by their own nature apart from any beholder.

As for works of art or craftsmanship, these things resemble corporeal
living things in having a shape that does not belong to the material
used in their embodiment. But this shape lives (so to speak) only in the
mind of the maker. It is not part of Arda (or Eä) apart from that mind;
and it may indeed only be recognized as a "shape" by that mind, or by
others of like kind. Those who had never had need or thought of a staff,
if they saw one, might not distinguish it from any chance piece of wood.
For the most part the Incarnate do, or think that they do (for they may
be deceived by the chances of Arda), recognize the purposeful touches of
shaping hands in things of art or craft, even when the purpose is not
known. But this is because they are like minds, and have experience in
themselves of this mode of shaping. Moreover shapes of this mode are
only name-worthy when complete, either completely finished, or so far
made that their ultimate form may be foreseen or nearly guessed.

In this way, therefore, living forms (not imposed) may be distinguished
from those given by craftsmen. The living forms grow; but they have at
all stages a true form that is name-worthy. Being part of
[]{#calibre_link-1786 aria-label="254" role="doc-pagebreak"}a total
shape, extending over Time, each instant of their existence partakes in
that reality (or realization). We may speak of a "young" tree (or
"sapling"), and of a "young" man (or "child"), judging the form to be
tree or man, but because of memory and experience deeming (not always
rightly) that this tree or man is in an early stage of its development.
But beholding a craftsman making a chair we should not call its first
stage a "young" chair. We should say at different moments that he was
making something of (say) wood; that he was making a piece of furniture;
and that he was going to make a chair (when the shape was so far
advanced that we could guess this). But we should not call his work "a
chair" until it was finished.

Thus when we speak of things named, we must distinguish three kinds.
Some have a shape and being of their own, which we did not give, and
which would exist so, even if we did not exist: these are living things,
which though we may use them, have as primary purpose to be themselves.
Some have their individuality only in the names given to them by
name-givers, and have only such bounds as the name-givers ascribe to
them. This name-giving is related to the arts of the Incarnate. For
either the mind of the name-giver, though no work of his hands is
involved, selects from Arda a memorable shape that he might have made or
might make if he had the skill and power; or he attributes that which he
sees, as a mountain or lake, to the work of a mind that had purpose
(such as one of the Valar). Some, the third kind, have shapes given to
them by Incarnate minds with purposes belonging to the minds and not to
the materials. But since all things in Arda are akin, the form of Art
respects the nature of the material, and should do so.

All that has been said concerning things of life corporeal applies fully
to the Incarnate also. For they use a body of life corporeal. But with
regard to the Incarnate this must be added: their bodies are governed
indeed, as are bodies without *fëar*, by living and growing patterns;
but over that again is now the indwelling spirit, which exerts power
over the life corporeal, and so over the material also. When the *fëa*
is strong, and when it is not weakened by the Shadow so as to be turned
away from its good, it sustains the life corporeal (as a master may
support and succour a servant), so that it too is strong, to complete
itself and to resist affronts from without, or to heal and restore any
injuries to its embodiment.

Much more, then, than in even a healthy living thing without *fëa*, its
being must be sought in its life-pattern rather than in the material of
its body; so that change in that material, or the substitution of
[]{#calibre_link-1787 aria-label="255" role="doc-pagebreak"}equivalent
materials, as long as these are adequate for the continuation of the
life and coherence of the housing body, will not affect its identity and
individuality.

For the individuality of a person resides in the *fëa*. A *fëa* alone
may be a person. In the case of the Incarnate, though they are by nature
embodied, their identity resides no longer, as it does in things of
corporeal life only, in that embodiment, but in the identity of the
*fëa* and its memory. A *fëa* of this kind requires a "house" by which
it may inhabit Arda and operate in it. But a house exactly equivalent is
sufficient for it -- for it will *exactly* correspond to its memory of
its former house, and that memory being in the mind only and incorporeal
will not be concerned with the history of the material used in the
realization (so long as it is fitted for this purpose) but with the form
only. Therefore, returning, the *fëa* will inhabit the rebuilt house
gladly.

Even so, one might go on a journey, and while he was away lightning
might come and destroy his house. But if he had friends of subtle skill,
who while he was away re-built his house and all its appurtenances that
had been ruined in exactly the same shapes, he would come back to this
house, and call it his own, and continue his life there as before. And
even if his friends reported to him what they had done, would he not
still be content, giving to the house re-built the same name as the old
house had, and deeming that the evil chance had been healed?

He would be content, or at least he would accept with gratitude the work
of his friends and find in it a sufficient means for the carrying on of
his life in the same mode as was his wont. Alas! it might well chance
that the house, or something within it, had for him a value not residing
in itself or its fashion, but attributed to it by him, the owner: as
being, for instance, the gift of one whom he loved. With the counterfeit
(that is, the exact copy) he might then not be wholly content, saying
"this is not the same thing as the one that is lost". But this would be
because he loved the *history of the thing*, rather than any other
quality it had possessed, and because that history was connected with a
loved person he attributed to it part of that love. This is part of the
mystery of love, and of the singling out by love of one thing alone in
its oneness and history unique, which is of the nature of the Incarnate.
Such losses not even the re-housing of the Dead, under the authority of
the One, can avoid, for it deals with the future, not the past. Death is
death; and it may be healed or amended, but it cannot be made not to
have been.

Nonetheless one of the Dead re-housed, with whatsoever regret death may
bring, will remain the same person; and will inhabit and
[]{#calibre_link-1788 aria-label="256" role="doc-pagebreak"}continue the
life of the housing body, as if no evil had befallen it. To doubt this
is as if one were to doubt that a craftsman remained the same person,
when, after a work upon which he laboured was destroyed, he laboured
again with fresh material to make that work again, or to finish it.

It is then, we see, the relation of the *fëa* to its housing that makes
possible the re-building of this house without change of identity in the
whole person. If we return to consideration of living things without
*fëar* this will become clear. Of these it is true to say that they all
are unique in history and according to the Tale of Arda. To speak of
trees, for example. Each tree is unique; for no other tree can occupy
the same situation (comprising both the time and the room of its
growth). If it ends or is destroyed, then it cannot appear again in the
Tale of Arda.

Some may say, nonetheless: "Yet its being resided mainly in its pattern,
as a single exemplar of the pattern of its kind. What then, if after
that embodiment of the pattern was destroyed, the pattern was
reconstituted from the *same materials* (that is, identical) wherewith
it was before embodied? Will then the 'new' tree be other than the 'old'
tree, even in history? All those who knew the tree and mourned its loss
will rejoice; and Arda will suffer no loss or change, for both the
pattern and the materials will be as they were before the damage and in
the same relations. Would it not be truer to say then, even in history:
'This tree at this date suffered the marring (or destruction) of its
body; but soon after *it* (*sc*. the tree) was made again and so
continued its life'? And what if the re-making was accomplished not with
identical materials but with equivalents? The difference between
'equivalents' of the order of *nassi* has, as we have seen, no
importance for forms of a higher order."

To this it may be answered: "This is a proposition of thought only. In
any case we have here to consider not the materials (whether identical
or equivalent), but the nature of corporeal pattern. This is not 'of
Eä', but its embodiment belongs to a particular date or period within
Arda. When this embodiment is destroyed, the co-operation of pattern and
material and Time (which is the being of the tree) is ended. It cannot
be begun again (even if identical materials are used); it can only be
counterfeited. For the pattern is a 'design' extending through a period
of time, which therefore at any moment before its completion envisages
the future and has an energy, as it were, impelling the growth to
continue the development to its end. At the moment of the dissolution of
its work, from whatever cause, that impulse ceases.
[]{#calibre_link-1789 aria-label="257" role="doc-pagebreak"}We may say,
if we limit ourselves to the particular thing considered, not involving
ourselves with wider or deeper matters, that it was the 'fate' in Arda
of this tree to fail of full achievement. This may become clearer, if we
reflect not on premature death but on the natural death of living things
of short duration. If the tree dies, having fulfilled its span, who can
remake it? It was both its 'fate' and its nature by design to live so
long and no longer; its pattern is complete and ended; it is all 'past'
and has no more 'future'."

For this reason the Valar themselves do not claim ever to *re-make the
same* *tree*, whether its loss be mourned or not, but only (if they
will) to restore to the wealth of Arda a thing equivalent. They do not
undo history. This cannot indeed be done without the undoing of Eä.
Therefore, it is only the Elves that the Valar can, under the authority
of Eru, "re-house". For it is their nature *not* to end within Arda.
Those whose nature it is to end within Arda, that is to die naturally,
they cannot and do not re-house, as is seen in the case of Men. Even so,
the restored body of one of the Elves, is only an "equivalent", and it
is the *fëa* which provides continuity, since this still has a "future"
in Arda.

In all this we have not considered the Great Pattern, or the Major
Patterns: to which we refer when we speak of *kinds*, or *families*, or
*descent*. Men often liken these things to Trees with branches; the
Eldar liken them rather to Rivers, proceeding from a spring to their
outflow into the Sea.

Now some hold that as the matters of Eä proceed from a single *erma* (if
this indeed be true), so the life of living things comes from one
beginning or *Ermenië*

Manwë spoke to Eru, saying: "Behold an evil appears in Arda that we did
not look for: thy first-born children, whom thou madest immortal, suffer
now severance of spirit and body, and many of the *fëar* of the Elves
are houseless. These we summon to Aman, to keep them from the Darkness,
and here they abide in waiting, all who obey our voice. What further is
to be done? Is there no means by which their life may be renewed and
follow the courses that thou hast designed? For the *fëa* that is naked
is maimed and can accomplish no new thing according to the desire of its
nature. And what of the bereaved that live still but mourn those that
have gone?"

Eru answered: "Let the houseless be re-housed!"

And Manwë asked: "Is it thy will that we should attempt this? For we
fear to meddle with thy children".

And Eru said: "Verily ye shall not coerce their wills, nor daunt their
minds with wonder or with dread. But ye may instruct them in truth
according to your knowledge; and in Arda Marred ye may hinder them from
evil, and restrain them from what is hurtful to their kind.

"And have I not given to the Valar the rule of Arda, and power over all
the substance thereof, to shape it at their will under my will?

"This then ye may do. The Dead that hear your summons and come to you ye
shall judge. The innocent shall be given the choice to return into the
lands of the Living. If they choose this freely, ye shall send them
back. In two ways this may be done. The former body, as it was before
the injury that caused death, may be restored. Or the *fëa* may be
re-born according to kind.

"Have ye not seen that each *fëa* retaineth in itself the imprint and
memory of its former house (even if it be not itself fully aware of
this)? Behold! the *fëa* in its nakedness may be wholly perceived by
you. Therefore after this imprint ye shall make again for it such a
house in all particulars as it had ere evil befell it. Thus ye may send
it back to the lands of the Living.

"Let this be done soon, for the innocent that desire it; soonest for
those who suffer death as children; for they will have need of their
parents, and their parents of them. Yet of times the choice is committed
to the Valar, according to the needs of each case and the chances of
Arda. Great evils and sorrows will come to pass there; and it may not
always be expedient to send those who have been slain, by wounds or by
grief, too swiftly back into the perils that overcame them.

[]{#calibre_link-1791 aria-label="259" role="doc-pagebreak"}"As for the
wrong-doers, who will increase in Middle-earth, ye shall be their
judges, be their ill deeds great or small. Surely your judgement of the
naked *fëa* shall not go astray. Those who submit to you ye shall
correct and instruct, if they will hear your words; and when ye deem
that they have been healed and brought back to good will, they too may
return in like manner, if they wish. But the obdurate ye shall retain
until the End. The time and place of each return ye shall choose.

"As for re-birth according to kind: those who choose this must know
fully what this meaneth; and the time of return shall be in my will,
which they must await. For understand that, as hath been said, each
*fëa* retaineth the imprint of its former body and of all that it hath
experienced therethrough. That imprint cannot be erased, but it may be
veiled, though not for ever. Even as each *fëa* must of nature remember
Me (from whom it came), yet that memory is veiled, being overlaid by the
impress of things new and strange that it perceives through the body. So
it shall be that for a *fëa* re-born all its past, both in life and in
waiting, will be veiled and overlaid by the strangeness of the new house
in which it will awake again. For the re-born shall be true children,
awaking anew to the wonder of Arda.

"In this the Dead who are re-born shall find recompense for their
injuries. But let those who desire re-birth be assured of this: memory
of the past will return. Slowly, maybe, and fitfully, as by strange
hints and monitions or by knowing things unlearned, the re-born will
become aware of their state, until even as they become full-grown and
the *fëa* cometh to its mastery they will recall their former life.

"This may bring them sorrow, for they will not be able to take up their
former life, but must continue in the state and under the name that they
now bear. Yet this sorrow will be redressed, by greater wisdom (for the
*fëa* of the re-born will be twice nourished by parents); and it will be
strong to endure, and patient and prudent.

"Nonetheless, because of this danger in returning memory, I counsel you
that not to all the houseless shall ye offer this choice of re-birth. In
the first place those who are to be re-born ye should judge to be wise.
Also it were best that they should be the young in death, who have not
had long life nor formed binding ties of love or duty with others. In no
case shall they be those who were wedded.

"For the re-born could not return to their former spouse; neither could
they take another. Marriage is both of the body and of the spirit.
Therefore those who have a different body cannot resume a union made in
another body. But since they are the same person as before, who was
wedded, they cannot take a new spouse: for identity
[]{#calibre_link-1792 aria-label="260" role="doc-pagebreak"}of person
resideth in the *fëa*, and in its memory. This unnatural state shall not
be permitted.

"If there are any who having heard these things still desire re-birth,
say to them: 'It lieth with Ilúvatar. We will present your prayers to
Him. If He denies you, ye shall speedily know, and ye must be content
with other choice. If He assents, He will call you in due time, but
until then you must abide in patience'."

Is it lawful for one of the Dead to summon another from the Living (such
as a beloved spouse) to Mandos? Unlawful, were it possible. For the
Dead, if innocent, may return to those whom they love. If guilty, they
may not meddle again with the Living, not at least until they are
cleansed. But they cannot summon any of the Living unless through the
Valar; and this the Valar must refuse to do.

Is it lawful for two wedded persons (or others that are bound by love)
both (or all of them) to remain in Mandos together, if death shall have
brought them thither together? It is lawful. They may not be compelled
to return. But if they have duties to the Living (as parents to
children, maybe), then ye may dissuade them from abiding with just
argument.

Reincarnation of Elves
:::

Dilemma: It seems an *essential* element in the tales. But:

How accomplished? 1) *Rebirth*? 2) Or re-making of a *counterfeit
equivalent body* (when original one destroyed)? Or *both*?

[]{#calibre_link-1793 aria-label="261" role="doc-pagebreak"}1) Most
difficult in result; much easiest to arrange.

The most *fatal* objection is that it contradicts the fundamental notion
that *fëa* and *hröa* were each *fitted* to the other. Since *hröar*
have a physical descent, the body of rebirth, having different parents,
must be different, and *should* cause acute discomfort or pain to the
reborn *fëa*.

There are *many other* objections: as

\(a\) unfairness to second parents to foist a child on them whose *fëa*
already had experience and a character -- unless they were consulted.
How could they be?

\(b\) Problem of *memory*. Unless identity of *personality*, and
conscious continuity of experience were preserved, re-birth would offer
*no* consolation for death and bereavement. If memory were preserved and
(eventually) regained by the re-born, this would produce difficulties.
Not so much psychological as practical. (The idea in previous
considerations of double joy, and memory of two youths or springs as a
recompense for "death" is good enough psychologically.)

\(c\) But if memory and continuity of personality is preserved (as it
must be) then we must suppose (as has been supposed in previous
treatments) that the reborn *fëa* would assimilate its new body to its
memory of the former, and would when "full grown" become visibly as
interiorly the same person again.

*What then of its relations* to former kin and friends, and especially
to a *former* *spouse*? It could only re-marry the former spouse: in
fact it must do so -- but then there would be a discrepancy of age, and
rebirth must be at least swift. No time for Mandos to consider how long
he should keep them "houseless"!

\(d\) How could re-marriage be arranged for, or opportunity of
re-meeting?

2\) Difficulties are here "mechanical". How could the Valar re-make an
exactly equivalent body -- which of them would do this (or all)? It
could only be done in *Aman* (certainly under such conditions as
prevailed during Exile of Ñoldor). How would the rehoused *fëa* then be
sent back? *The only solution* seems to be this:

There was no provision for re-incarnation in the Music known to the
Valar. Elves were not supposed to die. The Valar soon found many
houseless spirits gathered in Mandos. E.g. some "deaths" probable even
on Great March. (There need only be few.)[^470]

[]{#calibre_link-854 aria-label="262" role="doc-pagebreak"}They did
nothing until the case of Míriel[^471] made the matter immediate.
Because they did not "understand" the Children, and were not competent
or permitted to meddle. Manwë then directly appealed to Eru for counsel.

Eru accepts and ratifies the position -- though clearly he thinks the
Valar should have contested Melkor's domination of Middle-earth earlier,
and made it "safe for the Elves" -- they had not enough *estel*
\['trust'\] that in a *legitimate war* Eru would not have allowed Melkor
to so damage Arda that the Children could not come, or live in it. The
*fëar* of the Dead all go to Mandos in Aman: or rather they are now
summoned thither by the authority given by Eru. A place is made for
them. (They may refuse the summons, because they must remain free
wills.)

The Valar have power in Aman to re-build bodies *for the Elves*. The
naked *fëa* is open to their inspection -- or at least *if it desires
reincarnation it will co-operate* and reveal its memory. The memory is
so detailed that a houseless *fëa* can induce in another *fëa* a picture
of it (if it tries: hence notion of "phantoms" -- which are indeed
mental appearances).[^472] The new body will be made of identical
materials to a precise pattern. Here there will come discussion of
nature of "identity-equivalence" in material constructions.

The rehoused *fëa* will *normally* remain in Aman. Only in very
exceptional cases as Beren and Lúthien will they be transported back to
Middle-earth. (*How* perhaps need not be made any clearer than the mode
by which the Valar in physical form could go from Aman to Middle-earth.)
Hence *death* in Middle-earth had much of same sort of sorrow and
sunderance for Elves and Men. But as Andreth saw the *certainty* of
living again and *doing* things in incarnate form -- if desired -- made
a vast difference in death as a personal terror. After removal of/?
destruction of Aman as physical part of Arda -- there could be no
return. Only way of reunion of bereaved was by death of both parties --
though after end of Beleriand and Battle which destroyed Morgoth the
bereaved could *voyage* to Aman. They usually did! After destruction of
Númenor, *only* the Elves could normally do this.

[]{#calibre_link-1794 aria-label="263" role="doc-pagebreak"}Could
possibly the "houseless" *fëa*, in proper case, be allowed to/instructed
how to rebuild its own "house" from memory?[^473] [^474]

This solution seems to fit the tales well enough. In fact very well. But
of course the exact nature of existence in Aman or Eressëa after its
"removal" must be dubious and unexplained. Also how "mortals" could go
there at all!

The latter not very difficult. Eru committed the Dead of mortals also to
Mandos. (That had been done long before: Manwë knew they would be
mortal.) They waited then a while in recollection before going to Eru.
The sojourn of say Frodo in Eressëa -- then on to Mandos? -- was only an
extended form of this. Frodo would *eventually* leave the world
(desiring to do so). So that the sailing on ship was equivalent to
death.

*Memory* by a *fëa* of experience is evidently powerful, vivid, and
complete. So the underlying suggestion is that "matter" will be taken up
into "spirit", by becoming part of its knowledge -- and so rendered
timeless and under the spirit's command. As the Elves remaining in
Middle-earth slowly "consumed" their bodies -- or made them into
raiments of memory? The resurrection of the body therefore (at least as
far as Elves were concerned) was in a sense *incorporeal*. But while it
could pass physical barriers *at will*, it could *at will* oppose a
barrier to matter. If you touched a resurrected body you *felt* it. Or
*if* *it willed* it could simply elude you -- disappear. Its *position
in space* was *at will*.

On 'rebirth', reincarnation by restoration,\
among Elves. With a note on the Dwarves.[^475]
:::

Restoration of Elvish bodies. The whole matter of Elvish beliefs and
theories concerning their "bodies" and the relations of these to their
"spirits" -- which for the purposes of this mythology are treated as
"true" and derived by the Elvish lore-masters from the Valar -- is set
out in various places elsewhere. But it may here be noted that the Eldar
held that an Elf's spirit (*fëa*) had a complete knowledge of every
detail of its body in general and in particulars peculiar to it as a
unique thing. This knowledge it retained when spirit and body were
divorced: in fact it then became clearer, for Elves in health seldom
*consciously* thought about their bodies, unless they had a special
interest in such "lore"; whereas a disembodied spirit yearned for its
body as its natural and unique housing, and in the Halls of Waiting
dwelt much in memory of its lost companion. Now the Valar, sub-creators
under Eru, could make use of this memory; without any interrogation,
since the mind of a disembodied spirit was open to them completely, and
with far keener insight and knowledge than any possessed by the spirit
itself. From this "inspection", having among them as a whole a complete
power over the physical substances of Middle-earth, they could
reconstitute a body totally suitable to the deprived
spirit.[^476] [^477]

The notion, which appears in some places in the *Silmarillion*, as yet
unrevised, that Elvish reincarnation was achieved, or was sometimes
achieved, by rebirth as a child among their own kindred, must be
abandoned -- or at least noted as a false notion.[^478] For the Elves
[]{#calibre_link-852 aria-label="265" role="doc-pagebreak"}believed and
asserted that they had learned this from the Valar, that Eru alone could
create "spirits" with *independent*, though secondary, being; and that
each of these spirits was individual and unique. Yet He had made the
"spirits" of His Children (Elves and Men) of such a nature that they
needed physical bodies and loved them, and would love and need the
beauties and wonders of the physical world about them. But he delegated
the procreation of bodies to the Children: that is, to be accomplished
according to their wills, and choice of partners and of times and
places, though otherwise the process was beyond their powers and skill.
He, said the Elves, thus designed to produce that strange and marvellous
combination of unique being with a "housing" that had descent and
kinship within the physical order, which was the peculiar character of
His Children. Therefore since the creative power of Eru was infinite
(both outside and within the confines of His great Design in which we
have part) it would be absurd, indeed unthinkable, to imagine him
showing, as it were, a niggardliness in using again an unfortunate
houseless spirit to inhabit a new body. For even if this was produced by
parents of close kinship, it would *not* be its own, nor fully
acceptable to it. Moreover to do this would be wrong; since a spirit
that had already been born preserved a full memory of its former
incarnate life, and if this was in some way veiled so that it was not
immediately accessible to its consciousness, it could not be
obliterated, and this would contribute to its unease: it would be
"maladjusted",[^479] a defective creature. Whereas if it consciously
preserved its memory, as certainly those *fëar* did that the Valar
restored, it would not be a true child, and would have a false relation
to its second parents (whom it would know to be such), to their grief
and to their deprivation of the great joy that Elves had in the early
years of their children.

The matter of the Dwarves, whose traditions (so far as they became known
to Elves or men) contained beliefs that appeared to allow for re-birth,
may have contributed to the false notions above dealt with. But this is
another matter which already has been noted in the *Silmarillion*. Here
it may be said, however, that the reappearance, at long intervals, of
the person of one of the Dwarf-fathers, in the lines of their Kings --
e.g. especially Durin -- is not when examined probably one of re-birth,
but of the preservation of the *body* of a former []{#calibre_link-1796
aria-label="266" role="doc-pagebreak"}King Durin (say) to which at
intervals his spirit would return. But the relations of the Dwarves to
the Valar, and especially to the Vala Aulë, are (as it seems) quite
different from those of Elves and Men.[]{#calibre_link-1797

Christopher Tolkien notes (X:253 n.15) that there is a shift in the text
of *The Statute of Finwë and Míriel*, in which a break -- at "'So be
it!' said Manwë" (X:247), not at the end of a page -- precedes a
continuation at the top of a subsequent page -- with: "Therefore the
Statute was proclaimed ..." -- in a rougher script than what preceded
(usually a mark of Tolkien taking up and resuming a work at a later
date). It happens, though, that an apparently supplanted text, and the
*original* *recto* of the continuation page, intervenes. Though not
struck through, much of it was marked with square brackets, which often
indicates Tolkien considering its deletion, or perhaps removal to
another place. I give this unused/supplanted text here in full.
:::

It was asked, also: What if the bereaved spouse afterwards, by some ill
chance, be also slain or die; or if the second spouse also die. Who then
shall be the spouse of whom?

It was answered: If the bereaved spouse die, while remaining unhoused
clearly he (or she) is the spouse "in will" of the one left among the
Living. For the former union was dissolved and is no more; and moreover
the second one to die may still be reborn and return to the one left,
whereas the first to die is doomed to remain in Mandos. Not otherwise is
it if all three die. Still the union of the first and second is no more,
whereas the second and third may return and take up their marriage
again. But since marriage is of the body, being unachieved or of the
will only in the unhoused, the first and the second and the third may
meet in Mandos (if they will) in friendship. []{#calibre_link-1799
aria-label="269" role="doc-pagebreak"}Nonetheless this is one of the
ways in which the Statute may breed grief and not healing. For the
meeting in Mandos of those that have been willing to dissolve their
union, or of the one that came first in love and the other that
succeeded that, cannot be like to the meeting of those between whom no
shadow of inconstancy has fallen.

It was asked: What those in the Waiting do, and whether they have care
for those that live, or knowledge of the events in Arda. It was
answered: They *do* nothing; for *doing*, in a creature of dual nature,
requires the body, which is the instrument of the *fëa* in all its
actions. If they desire to *do*, they desire to return. They think,
using their minds (so to speak, for they are their minds) as they are
capable, upon their contents. These are the memories of their
life;[^480] but they may also learn in Mandos, if they *seek* knowledge.
As for those whom they have left in life, or the events of Arda, again
they may learn much, if they desire to do so. It is said that they can
see some things from afar through the eyes of others to whom they were
dear, but in no way so as to disturb or influence the minds of the
living, for good or ill. Were they to attempt this, their sight would be
veiled. But in Mandos all the events of the Tale of Arda (such as
knowable to others than Eru; for the secrets of minds are not readable
even by the Valar)[^481] are recorded, and to this knowledge and history
they have access according to their \[?measure\] and will.

This typescript text occupies five sides of four sheets of candidates'
examination script pages from University College Cork, Ireland, where
Tolkien was an external examiner at various times throughout the 1950s
(see TCG II:578). Tolkien added the title of the whole and of part I in
the top margin in red ball-point pen.

There are two pieces of internal evidence bearing on the question of the
date of this text. First is Tolkien's use of the form *Melcor*. In
previously published texts *Melcor* is otherwise found (not including
Tolkien's Anglo-Saxon translations) only in the seemingly contemporary
*Converse of Manwë and Eru* (presented in chap. XV above), the
composition of which followed that of *Laws and Customs* (X:209ff.) in
the late 1950s (see X:300) but preceded the Commentary on the c. 1959
*Athrabeth* (for this date, see X:304). Second, Tolkien initially typed
the form *hrondor* ('bodies') before later altering this to *hröar*; but
there is no independent evidence that the latter word was in use until
after the typescript text B of *Laws and Customs among the Eldar* was
made in c. 1958 (see X:141--3, 209, 304). On balance, this evidence
points to this text having been composed in c. 1957--8.

I. Death of Animals and Plants
:::

Animal bodies "die" when their coherence is destroyed. Their material
then becomes unloosed and dispersed. This is painful to behold
(especially for any who loved some such creature living, vegetable or
beastlike), and is more so as the remains still retain any likeness to
their living shape. It is held by the Eldar that in Arda Unmarred
[]{#calibre_link-1801 aria-label="271" role="doc-pagebreak"}things would
have died that were limited to a period of time (that is, those whose
total shape was small); and that many things were by nature of this
shorter duration. But the end would not have been abhorrent to look
on.[^482] (It would no doubt to the Incarnate have still held the pain
of loss and farewell. But that is in part due to the mystery of love
within Time;[^483] and in part due to the fact that the Incarnate only
entered in to the design of Eä after the rebellion of Melcor; so that
their whole being is bound up with the Marring. This, some hold, it is
the will of Eru that they should redress or atone, by the suffering of
love.) The end of things of short duration would not, the Eldar hold,
have been abhorrent; for living out their lives completely and unmarred,
they would have completely used up and discarded the material of their
embodiments,[^484] waning slowly (as they had begun to wax slowly)
through changes recessive and yet no less beautiful than the changes
progressive at the other end of their lives, until they disappeared. But
herein the Eldar maybe are importing into their thought of Arda Unmarred
the thoughts of hearts destined to live only in Arda Marred and within
Time. Is it not the loss of the thing that was, and the love of its
former shape, now dissolving, that makes the process of this dissolution
painful, or sometimes horrible? (Not all the things that *seem* evil or
unnatural to the Incarnate are the fruit of the works of Melcor.) If the
process of dissolution be the right or natural way of the return of the
material to the common use of Arda, it would not be painful or horrible
to those not bound by Time, who would still see the living thing in all
its duration, as a pattern complete.[^485] The moment that pattern was
complete (which is the precise moment of death) the remaining material
would have no concern for those who loved the living thing. If it became
slime, this would not be felt worse than the slime in which its growth
began. It would be no part of living things loved.[^486]

But to this the Eldar answer: True: regret and sorrow come to the
Incarnate from love that is (for the duration of Arda) bound within
Time. But decay and dissolution is not abhorrent solely because of this.
To speak of *olvar* (that is, plants): The soil in which it springs has
no part in it (until it is taken up as food by the life of the growing
thing, and appears transformed into living and admirable form). The seed
and the soil are clearly different. But at death it is not the
surrounding earth nor the ground upon which the dead thing falls that
seems horrible; it is the material of the thing itself that
disintegrating seems horrible. And in Arda Marred this process may be
long. Indeed death may be slow, and even before all life has departed
the living thing may become sickly, or deformed. We do not think that
this []{#calibre_link-1802 aria-label="272"
role="doc-pagebreak"}sickening and after it decay and putrescence can
seem beautiful (as surely all things in Arda Unmarred should be) or at
least not regrettable, to any minds whatsoever that love Arda, whether
free from Time or bound therein.

Therefore we hold that death and decay in the kinds that we now see
cannot be part of Arda Unmarred, in which we consider only "natural"
death and the end of completed life, and not the deaths of violence.
Also it may be thought that even those things that have by nature a
short duration would in the health of Arda Unmarred have lived longer
and more completely.

To speak of *kelvar* (that is, 'animals' or living things of all other
kinds than the plants).[^487] They do not grow in soil; but their bodies
decay into slimes and loathsome forms before they are dispersed. Their
end cannot therefore be likened to their beginning.

It would seem a wise conclusion that death, or the ending of living
things of short duration, is now otherwise in Arda Marred than it might
have been; and it has been marred in special by Melkor. For he desires
ever new things and loves nothing that has been or already is; and at
first he recked not how things were removed to make room for others, but
came at last in his hatred and despite of all things (even those which
he himself devised) to rejoice in their defilement.[^488] On the other
hand the Incarnate cannot rightly conceive of Arda Unmarred, in this
matter of death, for they in their begetting by Eru belong to Arda
Marred.[^489] And this is most clearly seen herein: they are as it were
the heirs and participators in death by violence. They cannot live
without causing the death or ending untimely of living things that have
corporeal life. Some of the Eldar (and some Men) eschew the slaying of
*kelvar* to use their bodies as meat, feeling that these bodies,
resembling in different degrees their own, are in some way too near
akin. (Yet none of the Eldar hold that the eating of flesh, not being
the flesh of the Incarnate and hallowed by the indwelling of the *fëa*,
is sinful or against the will of Eru.) But even so they must kill and
eat *olvar* or die; for it is their nature to be fed, as to their
*hröar*, by living things corporeal, and things have a right to live
according to their nature. Yet violence is done to the *olvar* (which
have a kinship with the bodies of the Incarnate, be it remote), and
these are denied the fulfilment of their own lives and final shapes.
Therefore we must hold that the Incarnate belong by nature to Arda
Marred and to a world in which death, and death by the violence of
others, is accepted.[^490] Neither Elves nor Men eat willingly things
that have not died by violence.

[]{#calibre_link-1803 aria-label="273" role="doc-pagebreak"}II. Death of
Incarnate Bodies
:::

Incarnate bodies die also, when their corporeal coherence is destroyed.
But not, by necessity, when or because the *fëa* departs. Usually the
*fëa* departs only because the body is injured beyond recovery, so that
its coherence is already broken. But what if the *fëa* deserts a body
which is not greatly injured, or which is whole? It then, it might be
thought, remains a living corporeal body, but without mind or reason; it
becomes an animal (or *kelva*), seeking nothing more than food by which
its corporeal life may be continued, and seeking it only after the
manner of beasts, as it may find it by limbs and senses. This is a
horrible thought. Maybe such things have indeed come to pass in Arda,
where it seems that no evil or perversion of things and their nature is
impossible. But it can have happened only seldom.

For the function of the body of one of the Incarnate is to house a
*fëa*, the absence of which is unnatural to it; so that such a body is
not ever in precisely the like case with a body that has never possessed
a *fëa*: it has suffered loss. Moreover while the *fëa* was with it, the
*fëa* inhabited it in every part or portion, less or greater, higher or
lower.[^491] The departure of the *fëa* is therefore a shock to the
body; and except maybe in rare cases this shock will be sufficient to
unloose its coherence, so that it will fall into decay. Nor in any case
would the deserted body easily turn to feeding itself after the manner
of beasts; for the matter of food (as all matters of governance) had
long been directed by the *fëa*, and carried on by means beyond the
reach of the body in itself; so that the mere beast senses were dulled,
and the body undirected would be less skilful than an ordinary beast.
Unless by chance much food of the kind required by it were ready to
hand, it would therefore most likely soon perish by starvation, even if
it survived the shock of the sunderance.

(The rare cases are those where sunderance has happened in Aman where
there is no decay. Also others more horrible. For it is recorded in the
histories that Morgoth, and Sauron after him, would drive out the *fëa*
by terror, and then feed the body and make it a beast. Or worse: he
would daunt the *fëa* within the body and reduce it to impotence;[^492]
and then nourish the body foully, so that it became bestial, to the
horror and torment of the *fëa*.)

To speak of elf-bodies. An elf-body is by nature and function made to be
the house of a permanent inhabitant, a *fëa* that cannot leave Time, nor
go whence its return to the body is impossible. Such a body, therefore,
will *wait* much longer, maintaining coherence and []{#calibre_link-1804
aria-label="274" role="doc-pagebreak"}resisting decay, but then it will
usually seem to sleep, lying passive and essaying nothing, not even the
search for food, without the command of its master. (It cannot be fed
without waking it, and thus killing it with shock, or rendering it
beastlike.) But man-bodies deserted by the *fëa* perish swiftly. They
are made to be the houses of *fëar* that, once they are severed from the
body, *never return*. The body then has no function (and the shock of
the separation is greater); and for the most part it soon decays and
passes away into Arda.[^493] [^494] It is known to the Eldar that the
*fëar* of Men (many or all, they do not know) go also to Halls of
Waiting in the keeping of Námo Mandos; but what is there their fate, and
whither they go when Námo releases them, the Eldar have no sure
knowledge, and Men knowing little say many different things, some of
which are fantasies of their own devising and are darkened by the
Shadow. The wisest of Men, and those least under the Shadow, believe
that they are surrendered to Eru and pass out of Eä. For which reason
many of the Elves in later days under the burden of their years envied
the Death of Men, and called it the Gift of
Ilúvatar.[]{#calibre_link-1805 aria-label="275" role="doc-pagebreak"}

By 1957 (see the [introduction](#calibre_link-10) to part one of this
book) Tolkien had decided that for astronomical verisimilitude the Sun
and the Moon, instead of being formed from the last flowers of the Two
Trees, long after the creation of Arda and the arrival of the Eldar in
Valinor, must in fact have been (at least) coëval with Arda, and that
the Elves must have known this astronomical fact. Tolkien was however
thereby left with a dilemma that he never fully resolved: namely, how to
incorporate this scientific truth into his mythology without
eviscerating its distinctives. (I have long thought that if Tolkien had
further decided that, when the world was made round at the Downfall of
Númenor and the Undying Lands removed, Ilúvatar had further
"demythologized" Arda and Eä -- by making the Moon be simply a rocky
orb, and the Sun and stars gaseous orbs, and making it appear that they
had always been so, and the world always round -- he could have
preserved both his mythology and a conformance to modern scientific
knowledge, and saved himself much time and thought and doubt.)

Even before this decision, from the mid-1940s on, Tolkien was greatly
concerned to achieve astronomical and chronological verisimilitude in
*The Lord of the Rings*. He expended great effort, for example, to make
the movements of the various members of the separated Fellowship
realistic, in terms of distance covered on foot or mounted each day
(matters of which, as a former British Army officer with equestrian
training, he had much experience); and further, to be accurate and
precise in the matter of the phases and positions of the Moon (see L:74,
80; also VII:179--80, 367--9).

Unsurprisingly, when Tolkien resumed work on his *legendarium* after the
completion of *The Lord of the Rings*, he brought this same concern for
verisimilitude to bear. As seen in part one of this book,
[]{#calibre_link-1809 aria-label="279" role="doc-pagebreak"}"Time and
Ageing", Tolkien expended considerable effort (both of thought and
mathematics) to bring natural realism to the matters of Elvish
population and migration. This third and final part comprises much
wider-ranging texts, showing Tolkien's late consideration, in light of
this concern, of broader aspects of his created world, its lands, and
its inhabitants.

This text, written in an at places exceedingly difficult scrawl in black
ball-point pen, is found among a bundle of late papers, (nearly) all
Allen & Unwin scrap paper dating from the late 1960s, containing
writings in reconsideration of various matters of Elvish vocabulary and
nomenclature.[^495] One of the matters taken up in this bundle concerns
certain Eldarin bases and concepts related to light and darkness. The
first text from this bundle, which exists in three successive versions
(labelled here A--C), shows Tolkien's development of what he describes
as the Elves' "mytho-astronomical" picture of the world and the
phenomena of dark and light.

√PHUY: Noldorin Q. *fuinë*, Vanyarin Q. *huinë*, S. *fuin.*[^496] In
Sindarin *fuin* was the ordinary word for 'night' without (originally)
any sinister tone. It appears far back in Quendian history to have been
imagined by the Elves as a "breath" that came out of the East as the Sun
went down in the West, which brought a cool shadow that grew ever
darker, beginning with \**dōmē* 'twilight' until middle-night, \**mori*;
the process from \**mori* \> \**dōmē* being reversed when the "breath of
light" from the East drove the dark westward, where it was absorbed by
Aman.[^497] \**phuinē* was this 'vapour-like darkness' (but S. *môr* was
† \[i.e. poetic\], *fuin* became 'night')[^498]

followed darkness and began by being starlit still, until it grew to
daylight; *undómë* followed light and became dark, and was the "sad
twilight", an image or sign of the passing of beautiful things.

::: ext
The text ends at the very bottom of the page. On the next sheet, Tolkien
began a new and somewhat different and at points more "scientific"
account of the Elvish conception of light and darkness:
:::

T[EXT]{.small1} 1B

The words for NIGHT, TWILIGHT, DAY were originally governed by the
primitive Quendian imagination of the passage of the Sun; and also by
their imagination of *light*. This they thought of as a "substance",
ever the most tenuous and ethereal of all things, an emanation from
*self-luminous*, light-giving things (such as fire on earth, and the Sun
in heaven in particular) that continued, or could continue, in existence
after issuing from its source, unless quenched, "swallowed", or
extinguished by DARK. (*Dark* was also a substance, only less tenuous
than Light, but was incalculably more abundant and prevalent than
Light.) "Light-substance" was called \**linkwē* (Q. *linque*),
"Dark-substance" was called \**phuine*.[^499]

In light-giving things all the stars and all heavenly lights were
included, except the Moon. The Quendi however seem to have guessed (and
later been confirmed in it) that *Anar* the Sun and chief light-giver
(*Kalantar*) of Arda was especially concerned with Arda and was far
greater than any others because it was far *nearer*, though still very
far away. Also they appear to have known or guessed that the Moon
(*Ithil*) was not a light-giver, but a reflector. KAL = light from a
light-giver (in Arda primarily from the Sun): ÑAL = reflected
[]{#calibre_link-1812 aria-label="282" role="doc-pagebreak"}light.
Certain stars (no doubt those we call planets) and among them especially
Venus, which they called *Elmō* (and later mythologically *Eärendil*),
they early observed were "wayward" and altered their places with regard
to the "far-stars" (fixed stars). These they called companions of the
Sun and thought them quite small heavenly bodies -- derived from the
Sun.

In their primitive mythology they thought that early in the time of Arda
(long before it had been made habitable) the Valar during their strife
with Melkor for the government of Arda, discovering the danger of
darkness, which favoured the secret machinations and works of Melkor,
had made the Moon (some thought out of a part of "Nether Arda", some
thought bringing it from outside the realm of Anar) to reflect the light
of Anar and reduce the darkness of NIGHT.

::: ext
This recapitulation and expansion likewise ends at the bottom of the
page; and again Tolkien starts anew, on the following sheet, with
another and still more "scientific" explanation:
:::

T[EXT]{.small1} 1A

The words for NIGHT, TWILIGHT, DAY, or their forms and applications in
Elvish languages, require for their understanding the primitive Quendian
imagination of the "shape" of *Arda* (our Earth) and the passage of the
Sun (*Anar*); and also for their changes in the divergent Eldarin
tongues a knowledge of the Elvish language.

The Quendian imagination of the shape of Arda and of the visible Heaven
(Menel) above it, was due to the acute minds of a people endowed with
sight far keener than the human norm. It was partly astronomical and
"scientific", but crossed with a mythological or poetic talent. Even
before their first acquaintance with the Valar they had evidently
constructed a picture mytho-astronomical of the world, which was in some
respects far nearer to our recent knowledge and theory than might be
expected. This "picture" endured in their minds and coloured their myths
even after the learned and most scientific among the High-elves who
dwelt with the Valar had, or so it may perhaps be presumed, learnt far
more the scientific truth (or what we now regard as the truth).

Their "imagination" was thus not properly a flat-earth cosmology; and it
was *geocentric* only as regards the Sun, Moon, and certain stars
("companions of the Sun" or wayward stars = our planets). The "Solar
System" -- Sun, Moon, and wayward stars -- was properly
[]{#calibre_link-1813 aria-label="283" role="doc-pagebreak"}called
*Arda* 'the Realm',[^500] but *Arda* was commonly used of the Earth as
the habitation of Elves and Men, to which the Sun etc. were tributary.
The Earth or 'Middle-land' (Q. *en*(*en*)*dor*) was apparently conceived
as *spheroid* (major axis 3, minor 2) with the major axis lying West \>
East. There was no childish pictorial myth of its supports: it was set
there by the Maker (or his agents, and there remained by their will). It
was not possible for terrestrial animals, nor Elves and Men, without
wings, to reach the West and East Poles or the uttermost North or South,
because it was cut by a deep circular chan\[nel\]

::: ext
Tolkien interrupts the text here, mid-word, above the following
representation of the elliptical spheroid just described, its West and
East Poles, a dot indicating its center-point, and perhaps a rough
indication of the "deep circular channel" at its edges:

writing "PTO" after the interrupted word, and starting one more
reconsideration on the verso:

was conceived as an elliptical surface longer (3) than broad (2), its
longer axis lying W--E. It was not flat, but rose up to its central
point gradually. It seems to have been imagined as having an
under-portion of the same shape (nether Arda) which could not be
inhabited since, not knowing of gravitation, the lower surface was
supposed to be bare, solid and \[?trackless,\] and all unattached things
(save only mist) would fall off. Later it was represented as an
elliptical spheroid of \[?some nature\]. But

::: ext
Here Tolkien's attempts at presenting a "mytho-astronomical" account of
the early Elvish conception of Arda was interrupted, at the start of a
sentence, for (it seems) the last time, save for a final accompanying
figure:

shows an elliptical Earth with a major East-West axis, and indicates its
central high-point. There is no indication in these papers what the
western and northern circles indicate, or the dot labelled "k"; but it
can be conjectured that the circle to the extreme west indicates the
abode of the Valar in Aman, and that perhaps "k" stands for *Kuiviénen*,
the 'Water of Awakening', which in the *Annals of Aman* is said to lie
"far off in Middle-earth, eastward of Endon (which is the midmost point)
and northward" (X:72). If so, the northern circle may indicate Melkor's
early northern abode, Utumno.
:::

T[EXT]{.small1} 2

::: ext
Like the preceding text, this discussion is associated with an adjacent
etymological note on an Eldarin base, which itself is reminiscent in its
terminology to texts 1A and 1B above:
:::

√LIK: 'glide, slide, slip, drip', applied to dew, water, \[?watery\]
liquid or half-liquid substance (as sap, etc.). From this was derived
the word \**linkwe* (Q. *linque*) 'light' as conceived as an ethereal
substance independent (when once emitted) of the light-giver from which
it emanates. This was preserved also in T. *limpi*, but not in Sindarin,
where it was used only for 'dew'. \**phuinē*, its opposite (material
substance), Q. *fuine*, became the ordinary Sindarin word, *fuin*, for
night, between the twilights but including the darker parts of these. In
Sindarin (which still conceived "light" and "dark" in the same way) the
words used were: 'dark' *dû* or *dú(wath)*; 'light' *glae*/*glaegal*
(√S. *glay-*).

[]{#calibre_link-1815 aria-label="285" role="doc-pagebreak"}*Limlight*,
modernized from Rohanese *Limliht* (as in Story of Eärnil), which had no
connexion with R. *lim* 'limb', but was a "translation name".[^501] The
original Sindarin name was *Limhír*; and evidently *lim-* was translated
by R. *līht* and combined as a gloss with older *lim-*, leading to R.
*Limliht(ēa)*.[^502] But in what sense (*līht* 'not heavy' or *līht*
'bright') is not now clear; nor is the original meaning of the Sindarin
certain.

Some older spellings, e.g. *Limphîr*, suggest that the first element was
originally S. *limp* (n.) \< \**limpi* \< C.E. \**liŋkwi* (n.), Q.
*linque* (n., adj.) '(bright/clear/gleaming) liquid'. This was applied
(in Quenya) to dew (or to fine rain in sunshine); in Sindarin to pools
or rills of clear clean water. It was probably in origin a
"mythological" word -- referring to the primitive Elvish conception of
"light" as an actual substance (emitted by light-givers, but then
independent), though ethereally fine and delicate. (Its opposite was
\**fuinē*, C.E. \*![phuinē](images/000034.jpg){.middle}*phuįnē* = the
thin shadowy cloud of twilight and darkness that quenched \**linkwi*.)
The Rohirrim enquiring the meaning of *Limhir* might well \[have been\]
told it meant 'clear, bright'; but that there was some uncertainty was
suggested by the unusual, in Rohan, preservation of the old name + a
gloss.

Another possibility is that the name really contains C.E. \**slimbi*, S.
*lhim*, Q. *hlimbë* 'sliding, gliding, slippery, sleek' -- used often
implying sleekness, a shiny or gleaming surface, or quick movement of
swiftly moving or flowing things.[^503][]{#calibre_link-1816

(with draft materials), which reads:

Primal Impulse

"Spirit"

Fragments, incomplete, concerning "The Primal Impulse" and conceptions
of "Spirit" and origins of terms for it in Elvish languages.

The first text, concerning "The Primal Impulse", is presented in this
chapter; the second, concerning "Spirit", is presented as text 2 in
chap. XIII, "Spirit", in part two of this book.

The first five pages after the cover sheet are torn half-sheets of
candidates' examination script pages from University College Cork,
Ireland, where Tolkien was an external examiner at various times
throughout the 1950s (see TCG II:578). The sixth sheet is a single sheet
of unlined paper. The text written on these sheets is all in black
nib-pen, in a hand at points calligraphic and at others very hasty.
Comparison of the text, particularly in points of terminology such as
"pattern" and Q. *erma* 'prime substance' and *nassi* 'materials', with
"The Converse of Manwë with Eru", presented as text 1 of chap. XV,
"Elvish Reincarnation", in part two of this book, indicate that they are
closely related and that this text likewise dates from c. 1959.

The text exists in two versions, called here A (the earlier) and B (the
later). Preceding A is a single page of increasingly rough draft
[]{#calibre_link-1818 aria-label="288" role="doc-pagebreak"}workings. B

The "prime impulse", of which the total unfolding is the Great Pattern
(*Erkantië*),[^504] having continuous life. This life will not be
co-extensive with the Tale of Arda;[^505] for as Arda began with the
*Erma* \['prime substance'\] and then the *nassi* \['materials'\],[^506]
before the entry of the living things,[^507] so doubtless the Great
Pattern will end sooner, leaving the *nassi*, and they will be reduced
to the *Erma*, until the Tale ends as it began.[^508] Yet while it
continues the *Erkantië* is unbroken and unceasing. Many points of its
growth may cease and proceed no further: this is when a living thing
perishes before it has produced any offspring or successor.[^509] But
the whole will not cease until such time as all living things then
surviving shall no longer produce living offspring.[^510]

This might happen by catastrophe, in which all living things
perished;[^511] or by the cessation of the impulse to generate as the
Great Pattern worked at last towards its completion. But, since the
pattern of any one living thing is not held to have ended until the
embodiment is destroyed or dissolved, the Great Pattern could not
strictly be said to have ended while still any living thing lived and
endured, even if it did not generate. On the other hand the Elves are
said to be "immortal within Arda", which should mean, as it is
understood, that they will endure to the utter end of Arda. Thus it may
be that Men and all other races of living things will perish and fail to
generate, whereas (as seems likely since the process may be seen in
operation) the Elves will long before the End have ceased to generate,
and their *bodies* will have been consumed by their *fëar*.

But others hold -- and their view seems to observe more clearly what is
known by lore and experience of history -- that this is not a true
account of the beginning or ending of life in Arda. They maintain that
*Ermenië* does not belong to Eä (and therefore not to Arda). It must be
referred to the uttermost beginning: the "Theme of Eru", as He first
propounded it, before the *Ainulindalë* in which the Spirits whom He had
made and instructed cooperated in the elaboration []{#calibre_link-1819
aria-label="289" role="doc-pagebreak"}and working out of the Theme. Thus
the *Ermenië* (which is a 'Device of Eru')[^512] being before the
*Ainulindalë* is also before *Eä* (the Realization).[^513]

For it is clear in such lore as we have received from the Valar that
they set in motion the unfolding of different living patterns at many
different points in the *Ainulindalë*, and therefore this was repeated
in Eä. Within Eä we have then not one single *Ermenië* or Great Pattern,
but a number of early or Major Patterns (*Arkantiër*).

T[EXT]{.small1} A

For it seems clear in such lore as we have received from the Valar, that
they started the unfolding of living patterns at many different points
in the Music, and so also in Eä -- only so can we understand the power
which the Valar certainly have and certainly exercised in days of old,
of *making things* with life corporeal[^514] -- as if one should set
many springs flowing in different places.[^515] These would not be
related in history nor proceed from one fount; they would be akin or
alike only through the nature of *water*, and because each stream would
perforce obey the laws of the coherence of Eä, that are alike for all
things, though directing them variously according to the situation of
each. (As for instance all streams would flow downwards unless hindered,
and wind swifter or slower according to the figure of the land.)

Thus we may observe the great complexity of corporeal life in Arda.
Derived ultimately from the *Ermenië* of Eru, we have the "devices (or
designs) of the Valar", separate each in time of conception and first
effecting, whether coming successively from one of the Valar, or coming
from more than one. These are the "major patterns" that we have spoken
of.

Their number none but the Valar can know. These are not rightly called
"akin" (unless by later mingling), for they are related only as
proceeding from the same mind (as of one Vala) or from like minds (as of
more than one of these), and their differences are given not developed
within and by the operation of Arda. But these "major patterns"
(*arkantiër*) developing in Arda will diverge whether by the design of
their beginners, or by the varieties caused by the stuff of Arda which
they must use, into different but similar groups of
[]{#calibre_link-1820 aria-label="290" role="doc-pagebreak"}descendants.
These are truly *akin* and members of races or tribes or families or
houses. At last and in our time it is beyond the skill of any but the
Valar to distinguish the likenesses due to the likeness of the minds of
the Valar from those due to descent in Arda.[^516]

And beyond this we have ever over All, Eru. That he introduced new
things into the Music (not in the Theme) we are told; for thus began the
conception of Elves and Men. (The Dwarves are a case rather of the
separate beginnings by the Valar, though \[? unless\] Eru tolerated and
blessed it.)

That he has never done so in other cases (of corporeal life or of
incarnate) or that he never will do so again, none can say. The Valar
report no such \[?intrusive\] things in the Music other than the coming
of the Children. But since Eru was not bound by the Theme, nor by the
*Ainulindalë* (as made by the Ainur), it would be rash to assert that He
is or will be bound by Eä realized; since He is outside Eä but holds the
whole of Eä in thought (by which it coheres).[^517] Some of those things
that appear suddenly in History and \[?continue\] then in obedience to
Eä (or soon cease to be \[?seen\]) may indeed be due directly to Eru.
(These things are called the signs of the Finger of Eru.)[^518]

Now in most living things (not all) succession is by \[?breeding\], and
by the mating or union of two. So those that mate, or \[?bear\] must be
akin. It is possible therefore that those that may mate and produce
offspring are *akin by descent*. Those that may not or do not do so are
not akin however they may resemble others because of the kinship of
their beginners. Yet even among the "kin" mating seems to require no
very great sunderance of branches. So \[?what seems but??? be akin\] by
descent \[?though\] remotely. Little is known of this. But we do know
some things which are nonetheless not easy to understand. For instance
we know that the First Born and the Second Born may mate, though this
has rarely been done, and as for the High Elves, the Eldar, only twice.
In Middle-earth unless tales be now \[?\] thrice: Beren/Lúthien,
Idril/Tuor, Ancestors of Imrahil. We must say that it was the will of
the Beginner of these two streams of life (Elves and Men), that is Eru,
that it should be part of the corporeal nature to be capable of marriage
and begetting -- for certain purposes of the Tale, and no doubt only in
the greater of the Eldar.[^519]

Therefore (though Eru's power is inestimably greater and his will
free)[^520] it may well be that other beginners made interbreeding part
of the capabilities of their respective streams or descents. Study will
show maybe that by interweaving its pattern with an earlier, the earlier
might be refreshed, and new variety come to being.[^521]

But Eru even in intruding the Children took as their shape a form
[]{#calibre_link-1821 aria-label="291" role="doc-pagebreak"}\[?that\]
though altered and refined, resembles in less or even in great degree
the forms of beasts. The Children are not "akin" by descent with the
beasts therefore but are related closely in the thought of Eru to them,
and with the beasts the Children have ever felt kinship, even akin.

The *fëar* of the Elves and Men (and Dwarves via Aulë, Ents via Yavanna)
were *intrusions* into Eä from outside. As the Valar were sent into
Eä.[^522][]{#calibre_link-1822 aria-label="292" role="doc-pagebreak"}

Powers of the Valar[^523]
:::

The Valar had power to endue things that they designed with corporeal
life; but they could not make things with independent minds or spirits:
sc. they could not make things of equal order, but only ones of lower
order. In ultimate truth they did not in fact "make" even corporeal
life, which proceeded from Eru. But they had assisted in the general
design of Eä, and severally, in different degrees and modes, in the
production from the *erma* (or prime substance) of things of many
kinds.[^524] The idea of life and growth came from Eru, but the Valar,
under Him, devised the shapes and forms of living things. When Eru gave
being to this design, in general and particular, and it became Eä,
unfolding in Time, He set in motion life and growth, or those processes
which would in time lead to this. But when he permitted the Valar to
descend into Time, to carry out in Eä (or reality) the things that they
had designed in thought, then viewed in Time they appeared to make
things which were alive. Indeed it is held that being themselves in Time
they experienced the making as a new thing, differing in this experience
little, save in degree of power and art, from the makers or artists
among the Incarnate. Neither they nor the Incarnate could make things
utterly new; they could not "create" after the manner of Eru, but could
only make things out []{#calibre_link-1824 aria-label="294"
role="doc-pagebreak"}of what already existed, the *erma*, or its later
variations and combinations.

The Valar, however, had of course far greater power over their material.
Not only had they enormously greater force of will, scope of mind, and
subtlety of skill, but they had complete understanding of the *erma* and
of the structure of its variations, since they had themselves (under
Eru) designed and brought about these variations, and their
combinations. Or rather, among them all such knowledge was to be found;
for individually they had possessed from their own creation, and had
shown in their assistance in the designing of Eä, different talents, and
each of them possessed some skill or knowledge of his or her own.

The Children, the Incarnate, were introduced into the design of Eä by
Eru, and the Ainur had no part in devising even their corporeal forms.
They had, of course, a vision of them in thought, received from the mind
of Eru; but they were not "in" the thought of any one of the Valar (as
were the forms of things the making of which had been deputed to them).
They were not realized fully until they appeared in history. It was for
this reason that the Valar feared to meddle even in the matter of the
bodies of the Children, until Eru gave them special authority. For they
revered the Children, as beings to them holy (in that they came from Eru
directly and not mediately). Indeed the vision of the Children to be had
great effect upon the minds of the Valar; as was seen in the case of
Aulë and the making of the Dwarves, or above all in the delight that the
Valar had to make for themselves forms like to those of Men and Elves
(according to their foresight, or to their actual sight later). These
forms were to them, as it were, their most favoured raiment, in which
they most often (but not always) were clothed.[^525]

It is said that of the Valar Manwë had the greatest knowledge, so that
no lore or arts of any of the others were to him a mystery; but that he
had less desire to make things of his own, great or small; and under the
cares of the Kingship of Arda the desire ceased, for his mind and heart
were given rather to healing and restoration. The harms and evils of
Melcor[^526] were to him the greatest grief, and he ever sought to
redress them or turn them to good.

Melcor on the other hand desired even with passion to make things of his
own, being restless and unsatisfied with all that he did, were it lawful
or unlawful. Within Eä he had small love for anything that had been,
desiring always new things and strange. He would ever be altering what
he had made, and would meddle with the works of []{#calibre_link-1825
aria-label="295" role="doc-pagebreak"}the other Valar, changing them, if
he could, or destroying them in wrath if he could not. Though his mind
was swift and piercing, so that, if he would, he might have surpassed
all his brethren in knowledge and understanding of Eä and all that is
therein, he was impatient and overweening (believing his powers of mind
greater than they were).[^527] Too quickly he assumed that he had
grasped all the nature of a thing, or all the causes of an event; and
his plans and works often went amiss for that reason. But he learned no
wisdom from this, and charged his failures ever upon the malice of the
Valar, or the jealousy of Eru.

Since he had no love even for the things that he had himself made, he
came at length to reck not at all how things had come into being,
considering neither their natures nor their purposes. Thus he desired
only to possess things, to dominate them, denying to all minds any
freedom outside his own will, and to other creatures any value save as
they served his own plans. Thus it was seen in Arda that the things made
or designed by Melcor were never "new" (though at first he strove to
make them so) but were imitations or mockeries of works of others.

In Elvish legend the secret of the making \[of\] "waybread" -- an
essential preparation for the Great Journey to the Western Shore -- was
taught them by Oromë. He brought as a gift from Manwë and Varda the seed
of wheat, and instructed the Quendi in the manner of growing,
harvesting, and storing it; but the grinding of flour, its kneading, and
baking into (unleavened) "bread" was committed to the
"bread-women".[^528] [^529]

"Waybread": art taught by Oromë to the Three Elderwomen of the
Elves.[^530] It was made from meal \[?ground\] wheat-corn (specially
brought to them by Oromë). This "Western Corn", it is said, slowly
diminished in virtue on the Great Journey, owing to the dim
sunlight,[^531] and there was no more Western Corn seed left when they
arrived in Beleriand. But when the Noldor came back they brought with
them new corn -- and \[it\] by a special grace of pity by Manwë and
Varda did not fail and was still in vigour till the end of the First
Age. Galadriel was one of the chief inheritors of it and of the art. But
at the time of L.R. only in Lórien did the Western Corn survive, and the
art was known only to herself and her daughter Celebrían (wife of
Elrond) and her daughter Arwen. With Galadriel's departure and the death
of Arwen, the Western Corn and Waybread were lost forever in
Middle-earth.

Note on Elvish Economy
:::

*Arable*. The Sindar did not practice agriculture until long after the
departure of the other Eldar.[^532] Of the "economics" of Valinor we
know nothing except that \[?initially\] food was provided for the Eldar
-- *not* without all labour, in which they delighted and made it the
occasion of song and festivals.[^533] But the grain (of some kind not
native to Middle-earth)[^534] was *self-sown* and only needed
*gathering* and the *scattering* of 1/10 (the tithe of Yavanna) of the
seed on the field.

The Dwarves had an agriculture -- which in early times they practiced
when isolated and unable to buy grain etc. by barter. They had invented
a "plough" of some sort -- which they *dragged* as well as steered
themselves: they were tough and strong -- but they did not delight in
such labour of necessity.[^535]

The Kingdom of Doriath was a woodland realm, and had only a little open
ground, except on its east borders where they kept some small kine and
sheep. Beyond the Girdle of Melian (eastward) there
[]{#calibre_link-1829 aria-label="299" role="doc-pagebreak"}was much
open land (prairie) of wide extent. The Sindar (E. Sindar) not under the
rule of Thingol dwelt and practiced not only cattle-rearing and
sheep-farming, but also grain-growing and other food crops; on which
they prospered because both Doriath west and the Dwarves east were ready
to buy what they could. *Flax* was grown in Doriath; and the Sindar
there were adepts in spinning and weaving it. They knew some metallurgy
and had good weapons on the Great Journey owing to the teaching of
Oromë. For long on the Great Journey they had depended on the arms and
swords, spears, bows, etc. made in their first home; or during their
sojourns -- if they could then find metals. In Beleriand they were
eventually aided by the Dwarves, who assisted (very willingly!) in
search for metals. Iron was found in the Gorgoroth![^536] And later also
in western parts of Ered Wethrin. There was silver there also. But of
*gold* they had very little, except what was washed out by Sirion near
Doriath's borders or at its Delta. But the Exiles were heavily
ornamented with gold, of which the total that they brought must have
amounted to a great weight. Before his death Fëanor had explored (as
much as possible) the ground looking for metals. It was the discovery of
*silver*, *copper*, *and* *tin* about Mithrim that contributed greatly
to his rashness in trying too soon to conquer and own, entirely, this
North region. But it was known that the best and most abundant *iron*
*ore* was in Thangorodrim.

The Eldar were not in the Common Eldarin period ignorant of either
horticulture or agriculture. These things they had begun to develop by
their own skill and inventiveness at a date long before the Great
Journey; but by the teaching of Oromë their practice was greatly
improved. The Eldar hoarded a great deal of food before they set out;
but they took with them not only weapons (hunting and defense) but light
cultural tools.[^537] Their sojourns during this age-long journey were
often prolonged -- so prolonged that at each stage some remained content
and stayed behind.[]{#calibre_link-1830 aria-label="300"

This text, which is written for the most part in a clear hand in black
nib-pen, arose in conjunction with a detailed linguistic consideration
of Q. *ambar* 'world' and *umbar* 'fate', and their close relation in
origin. It is located in a bundle of sheets among Tolkien's linguistic
papers that date from c. 1967, and is both near to and associated with
the texts presented in chaps. XI, "Fate and Free Will" (q.v.), and XIV,
"The Visible Forms of the Valar and Maiar", in part two of this book.

This text was published in somewhat different form in *Parma
Eldalamberon* 17 (2007), pp. 104--9. I have omitted here without
indication many passages of primarily linguistic and etymological
matters.
:::

Eldarin \**ambar(a)* 'the Settlement',[^538] Q. *ambar*, S. *amar* had
the sense of settlement, appointed place, as applied to the major
Settlement of all: the Earth as the appointed dwelling place or home of
Elves (and Men). The decision and choice was in this case attributed to
Eru.

It was no doubt the coalescence in form in Sindarin of *ṃbar* and
[]{#calibre_link-1832 aria-label="302" role="doc-pagebreak"}*ambar* that
caused the assimilation of \**amar* in sense of 'fate' to the verb
*amartha-* which had no reference to habitation. In Sindarin *amar*
'settlement' continued to be used in the sense of 'this world, the
Earth', though with the increase of knowledge it often excluded *Aman*
even before its removal from the "circles of the world" after the
Downfall. In Quenya *ambar*, though often apparently used as an
equivalent of 'the Kingdom of Arda' (*Ardaranyë*), in fact meant 'this
Earth', the planet, as a whole, including *Aman* until its removal, but
excluding other parts of "the Kingdom of Arda" under the guardianship
and headship of Manwë (Sun, moon, etc.). *Tenna Ambar-metta* 'Until
World's-end' thus meant "until the end of the finite time during which
the Earth is appointed (by its *umbar*: see below) to endure, at least
as a region inhabited by the Children (Elves and Men)".

In Quenya the other derivative of *√mar*: *umbar* meant a decision,
issuing in an ordinance or decree by some authority; hence also it might
mean the fixed arrangements, conditions, and circumstances proceeding
from such a decree. It was a word of lofty associations, mainly used of
the dispositions and will of *Eru*, with regard to Creation as a whole
(in full, *Eämbar*), to "this World" in particular, or to persons of
great importance in events.[^539]

The simplest form of this base \**mbără* became a much-used word or
element in primitive Eldarin: which may be rendered 'dwelling'. This
application was probably a development during the period of the Great
Journey to the Western Shores, during which many halls of varying
duration were made by the Eldar at the choice of their leaders, as a
whole, or for separate groups. This element survived in various forms in
Quenya and Sindarin with sense-changes due to the divergent history of
the Eldar that passed over Sea and of those remaining in Beleriand.

The principal forms were the primitive simple form P.E. \**mbăr(a)* \>
uninflected *mbār*, inflected *mbăr*; and the derivative form
\**mbardā*. The former survived in Quenya in the archaic word *már*,
which was used with a defining genitive or more often in genitival
compound: as *Ingwemar*, *Valimar*, *Eldamar* (among the Eldar normally
living and dwelling in it). This signified, when added to a personal
name the 'residence' of the (named) head of a family, and included the
adjacent lands attached to the permanent buildings or dwelling-houses
[]{#calibre_link-1833 aria-label="303" role="doc-pagebreak"}developed by
the Eldar in Aman. When added to the name of a "kindred" it referred to
the whole area occupied or owned by them, in which they were settled and
were "at home" as long as they remained a united people. (*Eldamar* is
thus translated *Elvenhome*.) It thus became in many cases synonymous
with Q *nórë* (in composition often reduced to -*nor*), though this was
only applied to large regions or countries, and was not added to the
names of single persons.

The derivative form \**mbardā* became in Quenya *marda* 'a dwelling'.
This normally referred to the actual dwelling place, but was not limited
to buildings, and could equally well be applied to dwellings of natural
origin (such as caves or groves). It was nonetheless the nearest
equivalent to "house" in most of its senses.[^540] The words for
buildings were derived from the base *√tam* 'construct' and *√kaw*
'shelter'. The former is seen in the very primitive and simple form
\**tamō*, translated 'smith', but meaning a craftsman in wood, stone, or
metal: carpenter (carver), mason (sculptor), or smith. The oldest,
derived product word was \**taman*- (Q *taman*, S *tavn*) 'a thing made
by handicraft'. 'Dwelling-house' is thus most closely represented in
Quenya by *martan* (*martam-*) or the longer *martaman* (pl.
*martamni*).

From *√kaw* was made the simple primitive form \**kawā* \> Q *köa*,
applied to any 'shelter' (contrived and not natural), temporary or, in
Aman, more often permanent, and applied to what we might call
"outhouses", huts, sheds, booths. The later and more precise form, using
the old instrumental suffix -*mā*, *kauma* remained in use for any
protection or shelter natural or otherwise, sc. against sun, or rain, or
wind -- or against darts. It was often used = shield.

In Sindarin, owing to the quite different circumstances and history of
the Eldar left behind in Beleriand, the development was different.
Before the coming of the Exiles from Eldamar a large part of the Sindar
lived in primitive conditions, mostly in groves or forest-land;
permanent built dwellings were rare, especially those of smaller kind
corresponding more or less to our "a house". The natural talents of the
Quendi had already begun to develop many crafts before the beginning of
the westward journey of the Eldar. But though the journey had an object,
in this period the Eldar became accustomed to a nomadic mobile life, and
after reaching Beleriand they long []{#calibre_link-1834
aria-label="304" role="doc-pagebreak"}continued with it, even after
those among the Sindar who still desired to cross the Sea had abandoned
hope. Thus the earliest essays of the Sindar in masonry were on the West
Coasts in the realm of Círdan the Shipbuilder: harbour-works, quays, and
towers. After the return of Morgoth to Thangorodrim their building
remained undomestic, being mainly devoted to defensive works. Their
skill developed rapidly during their association with the Dwarves of the
Ered Luin, and later was still more enhanced by the great arts of the
exiled Noldor. These latter had great effect in those regions where the
Exiles and the Sindar were intermingled; but the Exiles' arts and habits
had little or no influence in Doriath, the realm of Thingol, owing to
his hatred of the Sons of Fëanor. In Doriath the only great permanent
dwelling was Menegroth, which had been constructed with the aid and
advice of the Dwarves: excavated not "built", and underground in the
manner of the Dwarves: grim, strong, secret, though made beautiful
within by the Valian arts of Melian. Outside the buildings of this
period, the Siege of Angband, were mainly of defensive or warlike
character: walls and battlements and forts. Even the great "house" of
Finrod, *Minas Tirith*, as its name 'Tower of Watch' signifies, on an
island in Sirion, was primarily a fort intended to command the accesses
into Beleriand from the North. Only in Gondolin, a secret city, was the
art of the Exiles fully employed in building fair houses as dwellings.
But the Noldor generally built family houses in their territories, and
often established communities within encircling walls in the manner of
"towns". The Men who later entered Beleriand and became their allies
adopted the same customs.

:::

\[The Sindarin stem\] *philig-* is mostly confined to specific places in
the old tales of Beleriand. Its chief interest comes from its use in the
"title" or by-name of King Finrod *Felagund* (said traditionally to have
meant 'den-dweller', or specifically 'brock, badger').[^541] This
puzzled the earlier loremasters since the ending -*gund* could not be
interpreted from Eldarin. The Sindarin word *fela* could be derived from
a stem *phelga* or *philga*. It was used of minor excavations made by
wild animals as dens or lairs, and also as temporary dwellings by
wandering folk, Dwarvish or Elvish; it was usually distinguished from
the larger caves of geological formation used and extended by
stone-workers. It was thus naturally used of the "setts" of badgers
(which seem to have existed in great numbers in parts of Beleriand).
There were a number of such *fili* (pl. of *fela*, \< \**felȝi* \<
\**phelgai*) on the west bank of the lower Narog river where it flowed
along the feet of the great hills, "the hunters' Wold". But they were
made or at least long occupied by Dwarves, of the strange and sinister
kind known as []{#calibre_link-1836 aria-label="306"
role="doc-pagebreak"}the Petty Dwarves: in origin, as was later known,
descended from Dwarves banished for evil deeds from the great mansions
of their kind.

During the Siege of Angband, while Morgoth was (or seemed to be)
contained in his fortress by the Elvish armies and most of Beleriand had
peace, Finrod was visited by dark forebodings -- he was the wisest and
most farseeing of the chieftains of the Noldor -- that Morgoth was only
biding his time, and would break and overwhelm the ring of the
besiegers. He therefore made great journeys, exploring the lands,
especially in southern and western Beleriand. It is told that when he
came upon the Narog rushing down its steep course under the hills'
shadow, he resolved to make there a secret fortress and store-houses
against evil days, if he could; but the river could not be crossed at
that place, and in the far banks he saw the opening of many caves. The
tale of his dealings with the Petty Dwarves who still lingered there,
remnant of a once more numerous folk, is told elsewhere. But during the
years of peace that still remained Finrod carried out his design, and
established the great mansions that were later called Nargothrond (\<
*Narog* + *ost-rond*), the cavernous halls beside the Narog. In this
labour he had at first help from the Petty Dwarves and their feigned
friendship; for which he rewarded them generously until Mîm their
chieftain made an attempt to murder him in his sleep and was driven out
into the wild.

This text is located among the "Last Writings" which Christopher Tolkien
dated to the last year of his father's life (see XII:377). It is written
in a clear hand in black nib-pen on the versos of two sheets of a
printed Allen & Unwin "Publication Note" that is dated Feb. 1970. It
arose in connection with, and was originally a part of, the text
*Glorfindel II* that was published at XII:378--82. I supply the
beginning of the first paragraph of this text from that printed at
XII:380.
:::

Elves were destined to be "immortal", that is not to die within the
unknown limits decreed by the One, which at the most could be until the
end of the life of the Earth as a habitable realm. Their death -- by any
injury to their bodies so severe that it could not be healed -- and the
disembodiment of their spirits was an "unnatural" and grievous matter.
It was therefore the duty of the Valar, by command of the One, to
restore them to life, if they desired it. But this restoration could be
withheld or delayed by Manwë, for some grave reason: such as very evil
deeds, or any works of malice of which a disembodied spirit remained
unrepentant.[^542] Now Glorfindel of Gondolin was one of the exiled
Ñoldor, rebels against the authority of Manwë, and they were under a ban
imposed by him: they could not return in bodily form to the Blessed
Realm in any manner.[^543] Not while the Ban was in force.

[]{#calibre_link-1838 aria-label="308" role="doc-pagebreak"}This ban was
as is told in the "Silmarillion" never fully revoked. Though after the
defeat and downfall of Melkor[^544] and his creatures from Middle-earth
a general pardon was granted to all the Exiles who would accept it,
those who then left Middle-earth did not dwell actually in Valinor, but
in a special region of the great Isle of Eressëa that was set aside for
them. There they could visit Valinor from time to time, but could not
abide there long.

It must be supposed that Manwë intended to maintain the Ban -- unless
commanded by The One to lift it in any particular case, or in general --
until some change unforeseen by him in the unfolding of the history of
Middle-earth occurred.

Some of the Lore-masters later,[^545] considering the events which led
to the lifting of the Ban (as far as Elves were concerned) debated this
matter. The One, all-seeing, knew of the imposition of the Ban, and
permitted it; he also permitted its maintenance for long years, in the
terms devised by Manwë, though these might seem too severe even on the
Ñoldor, and were a great loss to the other Elves, and also to other folk
and creatures. In particular, making any communication between the
Ñoldor and the Valar impossible prevented the Ñoldor, in particular or
as a people, from expressed repentance, or pleading for pardon and help.
Some, therefore, of these loremasters concluded that Manwë, and the
Council of the Valar, erred: because of their anger; and also because,
though they possessed foreknowledge of history (since the making of the
Music, and the vision that Eru thereafter presented to them of the
unfolding history that it had generated), certain important matters had
become dark to them. They had had no part in the creation of the
Children of Eru, Elves and Men, and could not ever with complete
assurance foresee the actions working of their independent wills.

But the wiser ones among them rebuked them, saying: Ye cannot say that
the Valar *erred*, in so grave a matter, seeing that Eru knew and
permitted the actions and commands of Manwë, for this is to attribute
error to Him.[^546] Moreover, ye misrepresent and exaggerate the
workings of the Ban and so call in question its justice. As far as
concerns the Ñoldor, they obtained precisely what they demanded: freedom
from the sovereignty of Manwë, and therefore also from any protection or
assistance by the Valar, or indeed any meddling with their affairs. They
had been advised and solemnly taught by Manwë []{#calibre_link-1839
aria-label="309" role="doc-pagebreak"}to what straits and griefs they
would come, relying only on their own wisdom and power. They rejected
him; and even before they had finally left the West Lands and reached
Middle-earth, they did hideous deeds of robbery and bloodshed and
treachery.[^547] Then a large number of the Ñoldor, who had taken no
part in this, went back to Valinor, and sought pardon and were granted
it. Those that did not do so, even if not personally slayers, must share
the blood guilt, if they accepted the freedom gained by it. That none of
the Ñoldor should be allowed again to dwell in bodily form was an
inevitable consequence. That none of the Valar or Maiar should appear in
their lands to aid them was also inevitable. But it is not said that
Manwë abandoned them, peoples over whom he had been appointed by Eru to
be a vice-regent.[^548] His messengers could come from Valinor and did
so, and though in disguised form and issuing no commands, they
intervened in certain desperate events.[^549] [^550]

Moreover the Valar had great knowledge of the war of the Ñoldor and
Sindar against Melkor in Thangorodrim; for great hosts of Elves were
slain in that war, and some came in spirit to Mandos[^551] where all
their deeds in Middle-earth were laid bare. And yet again: great and
grievous as was the revolt of the Ñoldor, it was only a part of the
griefs and anxieties of Manwë, only one aspect of his heavy kingship:
the war against Melkor himself, which had now broken out again into new
malignance. It was indeed Melkor who was the prime malefactor, the
author and deviser of the revolt of the Ñoldor, though that was only
again a small part of his assault upon the Valar and their land, which
he had darkened and robbed of its primeval joy and beauty. From this he
had escaped.[]{#calibre_link-1840 aria-label="310" role="doc-pagebreak"}

*Elvish journeys* on horseback
:::

We are not dealing with the movements of human cavalry with its slow
pace (except in action): e.g., "walk" 3½ mph; "trot-walk" 5; "trot" 7,
etc.![^552] Elves (and their horses) were swifter in movement, hardier,
and of greater endurance. At need an Eldarin rider could remain in the
saddle for long hours with brief halts and light provision, while his
horse maintained a high speed, and they could cover great distances in a
day, with only a brief few hours' rest or sleep before going on again.
But we are in the case of Eöl's journey to *Nogrod* and back not dealing
yet with his desperate pursuit of the fugitives \[Aredhel and Maeglin\].
Eöl was "on a holiday", riding in the wild lands he loved, at ease, and
he had allowed ample time in which to reach *Nogrod* before the Feast.

Riding at ease he would journey about 9 hours, and at what was for him
and his horse the gentle speed of some 9 miles in the hour. Of this 9
hours he would spend about 1½ hours (more or less) in halts. He would
thus only go about 70 miles or less in a day.

Eöl was by choice a night-rider, being night-sighted, and training
[]{#calibre_link-1842 aria-label="312" role="doc-pagebreak"}his riding
horses to suit him. (But he had, of course, no fear of being abroad by
day, or at need of riding in sunlight.) At Midsummer[^553] when sunset
was about 8 pm and sunrise about 4 am, he would start about 7:30 in late
evening and go on about 4:30 in early morning (9 hours).

But he could, without wearying himself or his horse, journey for longer
hours, and at greater speed. For example, he could journey for 10 hours
at an average of 10 mph, spending no more than 1½ hours in halts, and so
cover easily 85 miles in a day.[^554] Speed, however, naturally depended
much upon the ground. From Elmoth to Gelion[^555] the land was, north of
the Andram, and the Falls below the last Ford[^556] over Gelion (just
above the inflow of the River Ascar from the Mountains), mostly rolling
plain, with large regions of big trees without thickets. There were
several beaten tracks made originally by Dwarves from Belegost and
Nogrod, the best (most used and widest) being from the Little Ford past
the north of Elmoth and to the Ford of Aros, it crossed the Bridge of
Esgalduin but went no further for, if the Dwarves wished to visit
Menegroth and Thingol \[?wished to see them they were\][^557]

Though not in fact among Tolkien's late writings, this seems an
opportune place to bring to wider attention a text bearing on the
history of the writing of *The Lord of the Rings*, as well as a charming
if rejected scene involving Legolas and horses. This text is written on
a torn half-sheet, and was originally intended as an insertion in the
drafting of what became the chapter "The White Rider" (ch. 5 of Book III
of *The Lord of the Rings*). At the top of the sheet a note Tolkien
wrote: "If new ending of Chap. XXIII is used, this will not be
required." To the right of this Tolkien wrote the number "XXVI", and at
the far right are the words "3 rider". (As Christopher Tolkien notes,
the chapter "The White Rider" "was numbered 'XXVI' from an early stage";
VII:425). The entire page was ultimately crossed out (the reason for its
rejection is discussed in the commentary following the text). In the
foreword to the 2nd edition of *LR* Tolkien says (xx--xxi), "I went on
and so came to Lothlórien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next
year I wrote the first drafts of the matter that now stands as Book III,
and the beginnings of Chapters 1 and 3 of Book V." This strongly
suggests that Tolkien drafted this rider early in 1942.

This text and the accompanying commentary by Patrick Wynne and
Christopher Gilson were previously published in *Vinyar Tengwar* 27
(1993).
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1845 aria-label="315" role="doc-pagebreak"}"What of our
horses?" said Legolas.

"I was forgetting them," said Aragorn. "We cannot lead them into the
Forest; there will be no food for them in there. They must be set free,
so that they can return as they will to their own master. We do not know
how long our search will take or whither it will lead us."

"But we do not yet know that it will take us into the Forest," said
Gimli. "At least let us take the horses to the edge of the wood! It is a
long walk from here to Theoden's halls, and you promised to ride back
there with our borrowed mounts."

"When our quest was over or proved vain," said Aragorn.

"Let the horses judge!" said Legolas. "I will speak to them." Running
lightly over the grass he returned to the tree under which they had
camped, and going to the horses he untethered them, fondling their heads
and whispering in their ears. "Go free now, Hasofel and Arod!" he said
aloud. "Wait for us a while, but no longer than seems good to you!"

The horses looked solemnly at him for a moment, and then walked together
behind the Elf towards the river-bank. There they stood quietly like
folk on a doorstep when friends are taking their leave. As the
companions went away up the slope they lifted their heads and whinnied,
and then bending to the grass, afar they strayed together, browsing
peacefully as if they were in their home-pasture.

::: ext
The text apparently describes Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas *on the
morning after* their encounter with the old man by the campfire (cf.
"\[Legolas\] returned to the tree under which *they had camped*"), when
they are on the verge of entering Fangorn Forest proper. In *The Lord of
the Rings* as published this occurs in "The White Rider", not "The
Riders of Rohan"; the latter chapter ends on the previous night, with
the three companions still camping by the eaves of the Forest. In
Tolkien's numeration at the time of composition, "The Riders of Rohan"
was numbered 'XXIII', and the significance of the note "If new ending of
Chap. XXIII is used, this will not be required" seems to be this:

In "The Riders of Rohan" as published, at the end of the chapter the
horses run away after the apparition of the mysterious old man: "The
horses were gone. They had dragged their pickets and disappeared."
(LR:443) But that chapter as originally written ended differently; in
the original version, the horses were alarmed but did not flee: "The
horses were restive, straining at their tether-ropes, showing the whites
of their eyes. It was a little while before Legolas could quiet them."
(VII:403) The insertion must have been written []{#calibre_link-1846
aria-label="316" role="doc-pagebreak"}to accord with this earlier
version of the story. Since the horses did not run away in chap. XXIII,
it was necessary to account for what was done with them later in chap.
XXVI when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli finally entered Fangorn. However,
Christopher Tolkien states that by the time of the completion of the
fair copy manuscript of "The White Rider", his father had changed the
ending of "The Riders of Rohan" to its published form (VII:432). This,
of course, is the "new ending of chap. XXIII" referred to in Tolkien's
note at the top of the manuscript, and with this change the insertion to
chap. XXVI became unnecessary.

::: ext
This typescript text exists in three versions: Tolkien's typescript (A),
its carbon copy (B) with no textual value save one brief marginal note
concerning Aldarion's later change of succession law; and (C) an
amanuensis fair copy, likewise with no textual value. The text given
here is therefore A, which occupies four-and-a-half sides. Christopher
Tolkien assembled selections from this text, and from that given in
chap. XIII below, into the chapter *A Description of the Island of
Númenor* in UT:165--72. He dated both of these texts to c. 1965 (UT:7).

In the typescript the text proper is followed by a series of (at times
quite lengthy) author's notes. For the reader's convenience I have
placed all but the longest of these as footnotes; the remaining two
follow the text and are cited in the text with "\[*Author's Note*\]".
The discussion of Númenórean life-spans that opens this text was
referenced and paraphrased by Christopher Tolkien at UT:224--5 n.1. This
discussion further echoes closely the matters and schemes Tolkien
developed at length for the Elves in part one of this book, "Time and
Ageing" (and cf. esp. chap. XVIII, "Elvish Ages & Númenórean", which
likewise dates from 1965, in part one of this book).

Lives of the Númenóreans
:::

*Long life and Peace* were the two things that the Edain asked for when
the Valar offered them reward at the fall of Thangorodrim. Peace was
readily granted; long life not so readily, and only after Manwë had
consulted Eru.

[]{#calibre_link-1848 aria-label="318" role="doc-pagebreak"}Elros was
treated specially. He and his brother Elrond were not actually
differently endowed, so far as the purely physical potentiality of life
was concerned; but since Elros elected to remain among the kindred of
Men, he retained the chief human characteristic as compared with the
Quendi: the "seeking elsewhither", as the Eldar called it, the
"weariness" or desire to depart from the World. He died, or resigned
life, when he was about 500 years old.

The remainder of the people were granted a life-span about five times as
long as that of ordinary Men: that is, they would die, whether by free
resignation or not, somewhere within the limits of 350 to 420
years.[^558] Within these limits individuals, and also families,
\[*Author's Note 1*\] differed in natural life-span, as they did before
the Grace was given. The royal family or "Line of Elros" was in general
longeval, and often lived for 400 years or a little more. In other
families 400 years was less often achieved; though in families who had
become allied with the Line of Elros by marriage (in the earlier
generations) longeval individuals often appeared.

By this is meant that the "weariness" was not felt by the longeval until
about the 400th year; how long they might have lived on into
decrepitude, if they had "clung to life", is not known, because in the
early generations they did not do so. "Clinging to life", and so in the
end dying perforce and involuntarily, was one of the changes brought
about by the Shadow and the rebellion of the Númenóreans. It was also
accompanied by a shrinking of their natural life-span. These things
first appeared in the 14th generation, that is, after the death of
Tar-Atanamir in S.A. 2251.[^559]

The increase of the Númenórean life-span was brought about by
assimilating their life-mode to that of the Eldar, up to a limited
point. They were however expressly warned that they had not become
Eldar, but remained "mortal Men", and had been granted only an extension
of the period of their vigour of mind and body. Thus (as the Eldar) they
"grew" at much the same rate as ordinary Men:[^560] gestation, infancy,
childhood, and adolescence up to puberty and "full-growth" proceeded
more or less as before; but when they had achieved full-growth they then
aged or "wore out" very much slower, so that for them five years had
about the same effect as one year for ordinary mortals.

The first approach of "world-weariness" was indeed for them a sign that
their period of vigour was nearing its end. When it came to an end, if
they persisted in living, then decay would, as growth had done, soon
proceed at more or less the same rate as for other Men. Thus, if a
Númenórean reached the end of vigour at about 400 years,
[]{#calibre_link-1849 aria-label="319" role="doc-pagebreak"}he would
then pass quickly, in about ten years, from health and vigour of mind to
decrepitude and senility.

If one wishes, therefore, to find what "age" a Númenórean was in
ordinary human terms of vigour and aptitude, this may be done so: (1)
Deduct 20: since at 20 years a Númenórean would be at about the same
stage of development as an ordinary person. (2) Add to this 20 the
remainder divided by 5. Thus a Númenórean man or woman of years:

::: section-symbol-break-page-end
![Table Image](images/000035.jpg){.full_width_image}
:::

would be approximately of the "age":

::: section-symbol-break-page-end
![Table Image](images/000036.jpg){.full_width_image}
:::

But this numerical calculation omits certain factors. Númenórean mental
development was also assimilated to some degree to the Eldarin mode.
Their mental capacity was greater and developed quicker than that of
ordinary Men; and it was dominant. After about seven years they grew up
mentally with rapidity, and at 20 years knew and understood far more
than a normal human of that age. A consequence of this, reinforced by
their expectation of long-lasting vigour which left them with little
sense of urgency in the first half of their lives, was that they very
often became engrossed in lore, and crafts, and various intellectual or
artistic pursuits, to a far greater degree than normal. This was
particularly the case with men.

Desire for marriage, the begetting, bearing, and rearing of children,
thus occupied a smaller place in the lives of Númenóreans, even of the
women, than among ordinary Men. Marriage was regarded as natural for
all, and once entered into was permanent;[^561] [^562] but like the
Eldar they tended to make the period of parenthood (or as the Eldar
called it, the "Days of the Children")[^563] a single connected and
limited period of their lives. This limitation was regarded as
[]{#calibre_link-1850 aria-label="320" role="doc-pagebreak"}natural. The
connexion, the treating of the period of child-bearing as an ordered and
unbroken series, was considered proper and desirable, if it could be
achieved. That the married pair should dwell together, with as few and
short times of separation as possible, between say, the conception of
their first child to at least the seventh birthday of the latest, was
held to be the ideal arrangement. It was particularly desired by the
women, who were naturally (as a rule) less engrossed in lore or crafts;
and who had far less desire for moving about. \[*Author's Note 2*\]

Thus the Númenóreans, who seldom had more than four children in each
marriage, would frequently produce these within a period of about 50 to
75 years (between the first conception and the last birth). The
intervals between the children were long as a rule, in ordinary terms:
often ten years, sometimes 15 or even as much as 20 years; never less
than about five years.[^564] But it has to be remembered in this regard
that in proportion to their total life-span this period was only
equivalent to one of about 10 to 15 years of normal human life. The
intervals, if reckoned also according to their degree of approach
towards the end of vigour and fertility, were thus equivalent to a
[]{#calibre_link-1851 aria-label="321" role="doc-pagebreak"}(rare)
minimum of one year, with a more frequent allowance of two, three, or
sometimes four years.

"Vigour", that is primarily bodily health and activity, and the period
of fertility and child-bearing in women, were of course not
co-extensive. The child-bearing period of women was similar to that of
ordinary women, though reckoned in Númenórean terms. That is, it ranged
from puberty (reached by Númenórean women not long before full-growth)
to an "age" equivalent to a normal human 45 (with occasional extension
towards 50). In years this means from about 18 to about 125 or a little
more. But first children were seldom if ever conceived at the end of
this time.

Thus a Númenórean woman might marry when 20 (marriage before full-growth
was not permitted); but most usually she married at about 40 to 45 years
("age" 24 to 25). Marriage was considered unduly delayed in her case if
postponed much beyond her 95th year ("age" about 35).[^565] [^566]

Men seldom married before their year 45 (age 25). Their time from the
year 15 to 45 was usually engrossed in learning, in apprenticeship to
one or more crafts, and (more and more as time went on) in seafaring.
Postponement of marriage to about the 95th year (age 35) was very
common; and, especially in the case of men of rank, high duty, or great
talents, it was not seldom entered into as late as the 120th year (age
40). In the Line of Elros (especially among the children of actual
kings), which was somewhat more longeval than the average and also
provided many duties and opportunities (both []{#calibre_link-1852
aria-label="322" role="doc-pagebreak"}for men and women), marriage was
often later than normal: for women 95 (age 35) was frequent; and for men
might be as late as the 150th year (age 46) or even later. This had one
advantage: that the "Heir to the Sceptre", even if the king's eldest
child, would be able to succeed while still in full vigour, though he
would probably have passed through the "Days of the Children" and be
more free to devote himself to public concerns.[^567]

Númenóreans were strictly monogamous: by law, and by their "tradition":
that is by the tradition of the original Edain concerning conduct,
afterwards re-inforced by Eldarin example and teaching. There were in
the early centuries few cases of the breach of the law, or even of
desire to break it. The Númenóreans, or Dúnedain, were still in our
terms "fallen Men";[^568] but they were descendants of ancestors who
were in general wholly repentant, detesting all the corruptions of the
"Shadow"; and they were specially graced. In general they had little
inclination to, and a conscious detestation of lust, greed, hate and
cruelty, and tyranny. Not all of course were so noble. There were such
things as wickedness among them, at first very rarely to be seen. For
they were not selected by any test save that of belonging to the Three
Houses of the Edain. Among them were no doubt a few of the wild men and
renegades of old days, and possibly (though this cannot be asserted)
actual conscious servants of the Enemy.

A second marriage was permitted, by traditional law, if one of the
partners died young, leaving the other in vigour and still with a need
or desire of children; but the cases were naturally very rare. Death
untimely, whether by sickness or mischance, seldom occurred in the early
centuries. This the Númenóreans recognized as due to the "grace of the
Valar" (which might be withheld in general or in particular cases, if it
ceased to be merited): the land was blessed, and all things, including
the Sea, were friendly to them. In addition the []{#calibre_link-1853
aria-label="323" role="doc-pagebreak"}people, tall and strong, were
agile, and extremely "aware": that is they were in control of their
bodily actions, and of any tool or material they handled, and seldom
made absent-minded or blundering movements; and they were very difficult
to take "off their guard". Accidents were thus unlikely to occur to
them. If any did, they had a power of recovery and self-healing, which
if inferior to that of the Eldar, was much greater than that of Men in
Middle-earth.[^569] Also among the matters of lore that they specially
studied was *hröangolmë* or the lore of the body and the arts of
healing.[^570] Pride was no doubt their chief weakness, increased later
by contact with Men of lesser kinds -- though not at first: their first
sentiments and motives were of pity and benevolence. They were also
proud of their ancestry, in general and in particular, as a people and
as individuals; and all men of all ranks kept scrolls of their descent.
Descent "from Eärendil" or "from Beren and Lúthien" were their chief
titles to nobility.

The later law, or rather custom, by which those of the royal house
(especially the Heir) wedded only members of the Line of Elros, was not
in the early generations possible. But in the days of Tar-Aldarion, or
about the year 1000, there were numerous descendants of Elros
sufficiently divergent in kinship. (Marriage with kin nearer than second
cousin was at all times prohibited, until the latter days of the Shadow,
even in the royal house.) This rule of royal marriage was never a matter
of law, but it became a custom of pride: a symptom of the growth of the
Shadow, since it only became rigid when in fact the
[]{#calibre_link-1854 aria-label="324" role="doc-pagebreak"}distinction
between the Line of Elros and other families, in life-span, vigour, or
ability, had diminished or altogether disappeared.

A[UTHOR'S]{.small1} N[OTES]{.small1}

\[*Note 1*\] The Númenóreans were not of uniform racial descent. Their
main division was between the descendants of the "House of Hador" and
the "House of Bëor". These two groups originally had distinct languages;
and in general showed different physical characteristics. Each House
had, moreover, numerous followers of mixed origin. The people of Bëor
were on the whole dark-haired (though fair-skinned), less tall and of
less stalwart build; they were also less long-lived. Their Númenórean
descendants tended to have a smaller life-span: about 350 years or less.
The people of Hador were strong, tall, and for the most part
fair-haired. But the chieftains of both Houses had already in Beleriand
intermarried. The Line of Elros was regarded as belonging to the House
of Hador through Eärendil (son of Tuor, the great-great-grandson of
Hador); but it was also descended on the distaff side from the House of
Bëor through Elwing wife of Eärendil, daughter of Dior, son of Beren
(last chieftain of the House of Bëor, and seventh in direct descent from
Bëor).

The Númenórean language was in the main derived from the speech of the
people of Hador (much enlarged by additions from the Elven-tongues at
different periods). The people of Bëor had in a few generations
abandoned their own speech (except in the retention of many personal
names of native origin) and adopted the Elven-tongue of Beleriand, the
Sindarin. This distinction was still observable in Númenor. Nearly all
Númenóreans were bilingual. But where the main mass of settlers came
from the people of Bëor, as was the case especially in the North-west,
Sindarin was the daily tongue of all classes and Númenórean (or
*Adûnayân*) a second language. In most parts of the country Adûnayân was
the native language of the people, though Sindarin was known in some
degree by all except the stay-at-home and untravelled of the farming
folk. In the Royal House, however, and in most of the house of the noble
or learned, Sindarin was usually the native tongue, until after the days
of Tar-Atanamir.

Sindarin used for a long period by mortal Men naturally tended to become
divergent and dialectal; but this process was largely checked, at any
rate so far as the nobles and learned were concerned, by the constant
contact that was maintained with the Eldar in Eressëa, and later with
those who remained in Lindon in Middle-earth. The Eldar
[]{#calibre_link-1855 aria-label="325" role="doc-pagebreak"}came mostly
to the West regions of the country. Quenya was not a spoken tongue. It
was known only to the learned, and to the families of high descent (to
whom it was taught in their early youth). It was used in official
documents intended for preservation, such as the Laws, and the Scroll
and Annals of the Kings, and often in more recondite works of lore. It
was also largely used in nomenclature. The official names of all places,
regions, and geographical features in the land were of Quenya form
(though they usually also had local names, generally of the same
meaning, in either Sindarin or Adûnayân). The personal names and
especially the official and public names of all members of the Royal
House, and of the Line of Elros in general, were given in Quenya form.
The same was true of some other families, such as the House of the Lords
of Andúnië.

\[*Note 2*\][^571] Númenor was a land of peace; within it there was no
war or strife, until the last years. But the people were descended from
ancestors of a hardy and warlike kind. The energy of the men was chiefly
transferred to the practice of crafts; but they were also much occupied
in games and physical sports. Boys and young men loved especially to
live, when they could, freely in the open and to journey on foot in the
wilder parts of the land. Many exercised themselves in climbing. There
were no great mountains in Númenor. The sacred Mountain of the
Menel-tarma was near the centre of the land; but it was only about 3,000
feet high, and was climbed by a spiral road from its southern base (near
where was the Valley of the Tombs, in which the kings were buried) up to
its summit. But there were rocky and mountainous regions in the
promontories of the North and North-west and South-west, in which some
heights were about 2,000 feet. The cliffs, however, were the chief
places of climbing for the daring. The cliffs of Númenor were in places
of great height, especially along the west-facing coasts, the haunts of
innumerable birds.

In the Sea the strong men took their greatest delight: in swimming or in
diving; or in small craft for contests of speed in rowing and sailing.
The hardiest of the people were engaged in fishing: fish were abundant,
and at all times one of the chief sources of food for Númenor. The
cities or towns where many people congregated were all by the coast.
From the fisher-folk were mostly drawn the special class of mariners,
who steadily increased in importance and esteem. At first the Númenórean
craft, still largely dependent on Eldarin models, were engaged only in
fishing, or in coastwise journeys from port to port. But it was not long
before the Númenóreans by their []{#calibre_link-1856 aria-label="326"
role="doc-pagebreak"}own study and devices improved their art of
ship-building, until they could venture far out into the Great Sea. It
was in S.A. 600 that Vëantur, Captain of the King's Ships under
Tar-Elendil, first achieved a voyage to Middle-earth and back. He
brought his ship *Entulessë* ('Return') to Mithlond on the Spring winds
(which often blew strongly and steadily from the West) and returned in
Autumn of the following year. After that sea-faring became the chief
outlet for daring and hardihood among the men of Númenor. It was
Aldarion son of Tar-Meneldur who formed the Guild of Venturers to which
all the tried mariners belonged, and many young men even from the inland
regions sought admission.

The women took little part in these things, though they were generally
nearer to men than is the case with most races in stature and strength,
and were agile and fleet of foot in youth. Their great delight was in
dancing (in which many men also took part) at feasts or in leisure time.
Many women achieved great fame as dancers, and people would go on long
journeys to see displays of their art. They did not, however, greatly
love the Sea. They would journey in need in the coastwise craft from
port to port; but they did not like to be long aboard or to pass even
one night in a ship. Even among the fisher-folk the women seldom took
part in the sailings. But nearly all women could ride horses, treating
them honourably, and housing them more nobly than any other of their
domestic animals. The stables of a great man were often as large and as
fair to look upon as his own house. Both men and women rode horses for
pleasure. Riding was also the chief means of quick travel from place to
place; and in ceremony of state both men and women of rank, even queens,
would ride, on horseback amid their escorts or retinues.

The inland roads of Númenor were for the most part "horse-roads",
unpaved, and made and tended for the purpose of riding. Coaches and
carriages for journeying were in the earlier centuries little used; for
the heavier transport went largely by sea. The chief and most ancient
road, suitable for wheels, ran from the greatest port, Rómenna, in the
East, north-west to the royal city of Armenelos (about 40 miles), and
thence to the Valley of Tombs and the Menel-tarma. But this road was
early extended to Ondosto within the border of the Forostar (or
Norlands), and thence straight west to Andúnië in the Andustar (or
Westlands); it was however little used for wheeled vehicles of travel,
being mainly made and used for the transport by wains of timber, in
which the Westlands were rich, or of stone of the Norlands, which was
most esteemed for building.

Though the Númenóreans used horses for journeys and for the
[]{#calibre_link-1857 aria-label="327" role="doc-pagebreak"}delight of
riding they had little interest in racing them as a test of speed. In
country sports displays of agility, both of horse and rider, were to be
seen; but more esteemed were exhibitions of understanding between master
and beast. The Númenóreans trained their horses to hear and understand
calls (by voice or whistling) from great distances; and also, where
there was great love between men or women and their favorite steeds,
they could (or so it is said in ancient tales) summon them at need by
their thought alone.[^572]

So it was also with their dogs. For the Númenóreans kept dogs,
especially in the country, partly by ancestral tradition, since they had
few useful purposes any longer. The Númenóreans did not hunt for sport
or food; and they had only in a few places upon the borders of wild
lands any great need of watch-dogs. In the sheep-rearing regions, such
as that of Emerië, they had dogs specially trained to help the
shepherds. In the earlier centuries country-men also had dogs trained to
assist in warding off or tracking down predatory beasts and birds (which
to the Númenóreans was only an occasional necessary labour and not an
amusement). Dogs were seldom seen in the towns. In the farms they were
never chained or tethered; but neither did they dwell in the houses of
men; though they were often welcomed to the central *solma* or hall,
where the chief fire burned: especially the old faithful dogs of long
service, or at times the puppies. It was men rather than women who had a
liking to keep dogs as "friends". Women loved more the wild (or
"unowned") birds and beasts, and they were especially fond of squirrels,
of which there were great numbers in the wooded country.

Of these matters more is said elsewhere, concerning the tame (or
"owned") animals of Númenor, the native beasts and birds, and the
imported.

Apparently in conjunction with writing the preceding text, and so
probably likewise c. 1965, Tolkien wrote two brief texts, both written
in black nib-pen, giving more precise tabulations of the differences in
the age of maturity and subsequent rates of ageing between the Line of
Elros and other Númenóreans. I give them in what appears to be their
chronological order.

The best time for marriage was held to be in "youth", though it could be
delayed during the years of vigour. For the Line of Elros it was seldom
entered into in the first years of youth; and seldom after the last
years.

Marriage could by nature take place thus between manhood and the end of
the years of vigour; but it was seldom entered into in the first years
of youth or delayed until (or beyond) their end. For the Line of Elros
about the year 100 was held to be the high or best time for wedding; for
others, about the year 50. But many women were []{#calibre_link-1860
aria-label="330" role="doc-pagebreak"}married earlier than this; for
them (in the Royal line) 50 was the high time, and 30 for others, and
they have children seldom after 150.

  --------------------- --------------------------------------- -----------------------------

The time of "maturity" (which implied full-growth of mind as well as
body) was held to be the best time for marriage; normally about the age
50, or for the Line of Elros 100. But marriage was often delayed by men
of keen mind, eager in various pursuits, and especially by those who
turned towards the Sea. It could be delayed until near the end of the
years of "vigour"; but this was seldom done.

Women came to womanhood and full-growth in the same time as men, but
their "youth" (beyond which they seldom bore children) lasted less long.
They were married younger (as a rule), and thus for the most part took
husbands older than themselves. Yet their lives were often longer than
those of men, for they were more tenacious of the world and their
pursuits therein, wearying less soon, and less willing to depart.

I give here a note from the same bundle of papers, separate from the
above, but consonant with it:
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1861 aria-label="331" role="doc-pagebreak"}The long
life of the Númenóreans was in answer to the actual prayers of the Edain
(and Elros). Manwë warned them of its perils. They asked to have more or
less the "life-span of old", because they wanted to learn more.

As Erendis said later, they became a kind of imitation Elves; and their
Men had so much in their heads and desire of doing that they ever felt
the pressure of time, and so seldom rested or rejoiced in the present.
Fortunately their wives were cool and busy -- but Númenor was no place
for great love.

This typescript text follows directly on from the text given in chap.
XI, "Lives of the Númenóreans", above, and occupies most of ten sides;
it is extant in precisely the same three versions, A--C, and again the
text given here is that of A. Significant portions of this text were
incorporated, with some modifications, into *A Description of the Island
of Númenor* (UT:165--72), hereinafter DN. There are however considerable
portions that have not previously been published. Christopher Tolkien
dated this text as well to c. 1965 (UT:7).

Of the land and beasts of Númenor

The opening paragraph of the text is echoed in that of *DN* (UT:165) but
it is there much compressed:
:::

Accurate charts of Númenor were made at various periods before its
downfall; but none of these survived the disaster. They were deposited
in the Guildhouse of the Venturers, and this was confiscated by the
kings, and removed to the western haven of Andúnie; all its records
perished. Maps of Númenor were long preserved in the archives of the
Kings of Gondor, in Middle-earth; but these appear to have been derived
in part from old drawings made from memory by early settlers; and (the
better ones) from a single chart, with little detail beyond
sea-soundings along the coast, and descriptions of the ports and their
approaches, that was originally in the ship of Elendil,
[]{#calibre_link-1863 aria-label="333" role="doc-pagebreak"}leader of
those who escaped the downfall. Descriptions of the land, and of its
flora and fauna, were also preserved in Gondor; but they were not
accurate or detailed, nor did they distinguish clearly between the state
of the land at different periods, being vague about its condition at the
time of the first settlements. Since all such matters were the study of
men of lore in Númenor, and many accurate natural histories and
geographies must have been composed, it would appear that, like nearly
all else of the arts and sciences of Númenor at its high tide, they
disappeared in the downfall.

::: ext
*DN* then follows the present text closely, though the description of
the general shape of Númenor provides a few additional details:
:::

The promontories, though these were not all of precisely the same shape
or size, were roughly 100 miles across and rather more than 200 miles
long. A line drawn from the northernmost point of the Forostar to the
southernmost of the Hyarnustar lay more or less directly north and south
(at the period of the maps); this line was somewhat more than 700 miles
long, and each line drawn from the end of one promontory to the end of
another and passing through the land (along the borders of the
Mittalmar) was more or less of the same length.

The Mittalmar was above the general level of the promontories, not
reckoning the height of any mountain or hills in these; and at the
settlement appears to have had few trees and to have consisted mainly of
grasslands and low downs. Nearly at its centre, though somewhat nearer
the eastern edge, stood the tall mountain, called the Menel-tarma,
Pillar of the Heavens. It was about 3,000 feet high above the
plain.[^576]

::: ext
The text again continues as in *DN* with few significant differences
save for the details that: the position of the Meneltarma in Mittalmar
was "nearly at its centre, though somewhat nearer the eastern edge",
that it "was about 3,000 feet high above the plain", and that it was "in
places" unscalable in the "last 500 feet" before the summit; "Towards
the great North Cape the land rose to rocky heights of some 2,000 feet,
the highest of which (*Sorontil*) rose straight from the sea in
tremendous cliffs"; that Tar-Meneldur's []{#calibre_link-1864
aria-label="334" role="doc-pagebreak"}tower was "the first and greatest
of the observatories of the Númenóreans"; that the "great curved
indentation" of the Bay of Eldanna was "warm, almost as warm as the
southernmost lands"; that Eldalondë was "almost at \[the Bay's\] centre,
not far from the borders of the Hyarnustar"; that the *yavanna-mírë* had
"rose-like flowers and globed and scarlet fruits"; that in Númenor the
*mallorn* reached "at its tallest height almost 600 feet", that its
fruit "was a small nut-like fruit, with a silver shale, pointed at the
end", and some were "given as a gift by Tar-Aldarion to King Finellach
Gilgalad of Lindon \[*deleted*: and there the *malinorni* grew during
the Second Age of Middle-earth\]"; that the river Siril "became in the
last 50 miles of its course a slow and winding stream; for the land here
was almost flat, and not high above sea level"; that the village
Nindamos lay "upon the east side of the Siril close to the sea" and that
"Great seas and high winds hardly ever troubled this region. In later
times much of this land was reclaimed, and formed into a region of great
fish-haunted pools with outlets to the sea, about which were rich and
fertile lands".

Where *DN*, however, comes to describe the Hyarrostar and the Orrostar
(UT:168--9), the present text shows significant differences, including a
long discussion of the fauna and flora of Númenor not found in the later
text, as well as considerable detail of distances and populations in the
island. I therefore give this middle section here in full.
:::

The south-facing and south-western parts of the Hyarrostar closely
resembled the corresponding parts of the Hyarnustar; but the remainder,
though high above the sea, was flatter and more fertile. Here grew a
great variety of timber; and after the days of Tar-Aldarion, who began
the regular care of forestry, some of the chief plantations were in this
region: devoted largely to the production of materials for ship-yards.

The Orrostar was cooler, but was protected from the north-east (whence
came the colder winds) by highlands that rose to a height of 2,100 feet
near the north-eastern end of the promontory. In the inner parts,
especially in those adjacent to the Kingsland, much grain was grown.

The chief feature of Númenor were the cliffs, already often mentioned.
The whole land was so posed as if it had been thrust upward out of the
Sea, but at the same time slightly tilted southward. Except at the
southern point, already described, in nearly all places the land
[]{#calibre_link-1865 aria-label="335" role="doc-pagebreak"}fell steeply
towards the sea in cliffs, for the most part steep, or sheer. These were
at the greatest height in the north and north-west, where they often
reached 2,000 feet, at the lowest in the east and south-east. But these
cliffs, except in certain regions such as the North Cape, seldom stood
up directly out of the water. At their feet were found shorelands of
flat or shelving land, often habitable, that ranged in width (from the
water) from about a quarter of a mile to several miles. The fringes of
the widest stretches were usually under shallow water even at low tides;
but at their seaward edges all these strands plunged down again sheerly
into profound water. The great strands and tidal flats of the south also
ended in a sheer fall to oceanic depths along a line roughly joining the
southernmost ends of the south-west and south-east promontories.

It would appear that neither Elves nor Men had dwelt in this island
before the coming of the Edain. Beasts and birds had no fear of Men; and
the relations of Men and animals remained more friendly in Númenor than
anywhere else in the world. It is said that even those that the
Númenóreans classed as "predatory" (by which they meant those that would
at need raid their crops and tame cattle) remained on "honourable terms"
with the newcomers, seeking their food so far as they could in the wild,
and showing no hostility to Men, save at times of declared war, when
after due warning the husbandmen would, as a necessity, hunt the
predatory birds and beasts to reduce their numbers within limits.

As has been said, it is not easy to discover what were the beasts and
birds and fishes that already inhabited the island before the coming of
the Edain, and what were brought in by them. The same is also true of
the plants. Neither are the names which the Númenóreans gave to animals
and plants always easy to equate with or relate to the names of those
found in Middle-earth. Many, though given in apparently Quenya or
Sindarin forms, are not found in the Elvish or Human tongues of
Middle-earth. This is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that the animals
and plants of Númenor, though similar and related to those of the
mainlands, were different in variety and seemed to require new names.

As for the major animals, it is clear that there were none of the canine
or related kinds. There were certainly no hounds or dogs (all of which
were imported). There were no wolves. There were wild cats, the most
hostile and untameable of the animals; but no large felines. There were
a great number, however, of foxes, or related animals. Their chief food
seems to have been animals which the []{#calibre_link-1866
aria-label="336" role="doc-pagebreak"}Númenóreans called *lopoldi.*
These existed in large numbers and multiplied swiftly, and were
voracious herbivores; so that the foxes were esteemed as the best and
most natural way of keeping them in order, and foxes were seldom hunted
or molested. In return, or because their food-supply was otherwise
abundant, the foxes seem never to have acquired the habit of preying
upon the domestic fowl of the Númenóreans. The *lopoldi* would appear to
have been rabbits, animals which had been quite unknown before in the
north-western regions of Middle-earth.[^577] The Númenóreans did not
esteem them as food and were content to leave them to the foxes.

There were bears in considerable numbers, in the mountainous or rocky
parts; both of a black and brown variety. The great black bears were
found mostly in the Forostar. The relations of the bears and Men were
strange. From the first the bears exhibited friendship and curiosity
towards the newcomers; and these feelings were returned. At no time was
there any hostility between Men and bears; though at mating times, and
during the first youth of their cubs they could be angry and dangerous
if disturbed. The Númenóreans did not disturb them except by mischance.
Very few Númenóreans were ever killed by bears; and these mishaps were
not regarded as reasons for war upon the whole race. Many of the bears
were quite tame. They never dwelt in or near the homes of Men, but they
would often visit them, in the casual manner of one householder calling
upon another. At such times they were often offered honey, to their
delight. Only an occasional "bad bear" ever raided the tame hives. Most
strange of all were the bear-dances. The bears, the black bears
especially, had curious dances of their own; but these seem to have
become improved and elaborated by the instruction of Men. At times the
bears would perform dances for the entertainment of their human friends.
The most famous was the Great Bear-dance (*ruxöalë*)[^578] of Tompollë
in the Forostar, to which every year in the autumn many would come from
all parts of the island, since it occurred not long after the
Eruhantalë, at which a great concourse was assembled. To those not
accustomed to the bears the slow (but dignified) motions of the bears,
sometimes as many as 50 or more together, appeared astonishing and
comic. But it was understood by all admitted to the spectacle that there
should be no open laughter. The laughter of Men was a sound that the
bears could not understand: it alarmed and angered them.[^579]

The woods of Númenor abounded in squirrels, mostly red, but some dark
brown or black. These were all unafraid, and readily tamed. The women of
Númenor were specially fond of them. Often they would live in trees near
a homestead, and would come when []{#calibre_link-1867 aria-label="337"
role="doc-pagebreak"}invited into the house. In the short rivers and
streams there were otters. Badgers were numerous. There were wild black
swine in the woods; and in the west of the Mittalmar at the coming of
the Edain were herds of wild kine, some white, some black. Deer were
abundant on the grasslands and in and about the forest-eaves, red and
fallow; and in the hills were roe-deer. But all seem to have been
somewhat smaller of stature than their kin in Middle-earth. In the
southern region there were beavers. About the coasts seals were
abundant, especially in the north and west. And there were also many
smaller animals, not often mentioned: such as mice and voles, or small
preying beasts such as weasels. Hares are named; and other animals of
uncertain kind: some that were not squirrels, but lived in trees, and
were shy, not of men only; others that ran on the ground and burrowed,
small and fat, but were neither rats nor rabbits. In the south there
were some land-tortoises, of no great size; and also some small
freshwater creatures of turtle-kind. The animals named *ekelli* seem to
have been urchins or hedgehogs of large size, with long black quills.
They were numerous in some parts, and treated with friendship, for they
lived mostly upon worms and insects.

There seem to have been wild goats in the island, but whether the small
horned sheep (which were one of the varieties of sheep-kind that the
Númenóreans kept) were native or imported is not known. A small kind of
horse, smaller than a donkey, black or dark brown, with flowing mane and
tail, and sturdy rather than swift, is said to have been found in the
Mittalmar by the settlers. They were soon tamed, but throve and were
well-tended and loved. They were much used in the farms; and children
used them for riding.

Many other beasts there were no doubt that are seldom named since they
did not generally concern Men. All must have been named and described in
the books of lore that perished.

Sea-fish were abundant all about the coasts of the island, and those
that were good to eat were much used. Other beasts of the sea there were
also off the shores: whales and narwhal, dolphins and porpoises, which
the Númenóreans did not confuse with fish (*lingwi*), but classed with
fish as *nendili* all those that lived wholly in the water and bred in
the sea. Sharks the Númenóreans saw only upon their voyages, for whether
by the "grace of the Valar" as the Númenóreans said, or for other cause
they did not ever come near the shores of the island. Of inland fish we
hear little. Of those that live in the sea partly, but enter the rivers
at times, there were salmon in the Siril, and also in the Nunduinë, the
river that flowed into the sea at Eldalondë, and on its way made the
small lake of Nísinen (one of the few in []{#calibre_link-1868
aria-label="338" role="doc-pagebreak"}Númenor) about three miles inland:
it was so called because of the abundance of sweet-smelling shrubs and
flowers that grew on its banks. Eels were abundant in the meres and
marshes about the lower course of the Siril.

The birds of Númenor were beyond count, from the great eagles down to
the tiny *kirinki* that were no bigger than wrens, but all scarlet, with
high piping voices the sounds of which were on the edge of human
hearing. The eagles were of several kinds; but all were held sacred to
Manwë, and were never molested nor shot, not until the days of evil and
the hatred of the Valar began. Not until then did they on their part
molest men or prey on their beasts. From the days of Elros until the
time of Tar-Ankalimon, son of Tar-Atanamir, some two thousand years,
there was an eyrie of golden eagles in the summit of the tower of the
king's palace in Armenelos. There one pair ever dwelt and lived on the
bounty of the king.

The birds that dwell near the sea, and swim or dive in it, and live upon
fish, abode in Númenor in multitudes beyond reckoning. They were never
killed or molested by intent by the Númenóreans, and were wholly
friendly to them. Mariners said that were they blind they would know
that their ship was drawing near home because of the great clamour of
the shore-birds. When any ship approached the land seabirds in great
flocks would arise and fly above it for no purpose but welcome and
gladness. Some would accompany the ships on their voyages, even those
that went to Middle-earth.

Inland the birds were not so numerous, but were nonetheless abundant.
Some beside the eagles were birds of prey, such as the hawks and falcons
of many kinds. There were ravens, especially in the north, and about the
land other birds of their kin that live in flocks, daws and crows and
about the sea-cliffs many choughs. Smaller song-birds with fair voices
abounded in the fields, in the reedy meres, and in the woods. Many were
little different from those of the lands from which the Edain came; but
the birds of finch-kind were more varied and numerous and
sweeter-voiced. There were some of small size all white, some all grey;
and others all golden, that sang with great joy in long thrilling
cadences through the spring and early summer. They had little fear of
the Edain, who loved them. The caging of song-birds was thought an
unkind deed. Nor was it necessary, for those that were "tame", that is:
who attached themselves of free will to a homestead, would for
generations dwell near the same house, singing upon its roof or on the
sills, or even in the *solmar* or chambers of those that welcomed them.
The birds that dwelt in cages were for the most part reared from young
whose parents died by []{#calibre_link-1869 aria-label="339"
role="doc-pagebreak"}mischance or were slain by birds of prey; but even
they were mostly free to go and come if they would. Nightingales were
found, though nowhere very abundant, in most parts of Númenor save the
north. In the northern parts there were large white owls, but no other
birds of this race.

Of the native trees and plants little is recorded. Though some trees
were brought in seed or scion from Middle-earth, and others (as has been
said) came from Eressëa, there seems to have been an abundance of timber
when the Edain landed. Of trees already known to them it is said that
they missed the hornbeam, the small maple, and the flowering chestnut;
but found others that were new to them: the wych-elm, the holm-oak, tall
maples, and the sweet chestnut. In the Hyarrostar they found also
walnuts; and the *laurinquë* in which they delighted for its flowers,
for it had no other use. This name they gave it ('golden rain') because
of its long-hanging clusters of yellow flowers; and some who had heard
from the Eldar of Laurelin, the Golden Tree of Valinor, believed that it
came from that great Tree, being brought in seed thither by the Eldar;
but it was not so. Wild apple, cherry, and pear also grew in Númenor;
but those that they grew in their orchards came from Middle-earth, gifts
from the Eldar. In the Hyarnustar the vine grew wild; but the
grape-vines of the Númenóreans seem also to have come from the Eldar. Of
the many plants and flowers of field and wood little is now recorded or
remembered; but old songs speak often of the lilies, the many kinds of
which, some small, some tall and fair, some single-bloomed, some hung
with many bells and trumpets, and all fragrant, were the delight of the
Edain.

To the land the Edain brought many things from Middle-earth: sheep, and
kine, and horses, and dogs; fruiting trees; and grain. Water-fowl such
as birds of duck-kind or geese they found before them; but others they
brought also and blended with the native races. Geese and ducks were
domestic fowls on their farms; and there also they kept multitudes of
doves or pigeons in great houses or dovecotes, mainly for their eggs.
Hen-fowl they had not known and found none in the island; though soon
after the great voyages began mariners brought back cocks and hens from
the southern and eastern lands,[^580] and they throve in Númenor, where
many of them escaped and lived in the wild, though harried by the foxes.

The legends of the foundation of Númenor often speak as if all the Edain
that accepted the Gift set sail at one time and in one fleet. But this
is only due to the brevity of the narrative. In more detailed histories
it is related (as might be deduced from the events and the
[]{#calibre_link-1870 aria-label="340" role="doc-pagebreak"}numbers
concerned) that after the first expedition, led by Elros, many other
ships, alone or in small fleets, came west bearing others of the Edain,
either those who were at first reluctant to dare the Great Sea but could
not endure to be parted from those who had gone, or some who were far
scattered and could not be assembled to go with the first sailing.

Since the boats that were used were of Elvish model, fleet, but small,
and each steered and captained by one of the Eldar deputed by
Círdan,[^581] it would have taken a great navy to transport all the
people and goods that were eventually brought from Middle-earth to
Númenor. The legends make no guess at the numbers, and the histories say
little. The fleet of Elros is said to have contained many ships
(according to some 150 vessels, to others two or three hundred) and to
have brought "thousands" of the men, women, and children of the Edain:
probably between 5,000 or at the most 10,000. But the whole process of
migration appears in fact to have occupied at least 50 years, possibly
longer, and finally ended only when Círdan (no doubt instructed by the
Valar) would provide no more ships or guides. In that time the number of
the Edain that crossed the Sea must have been very great, though small
in proportion to the extent of the island (probably some 180,000 square
miles). Guesses vary between 200,000 and 350,000 people.[^582] After a
thousand years the population seems not to have much exceeded 2 million.
This was greatly increased later; but outlet was found in the Númenórean
settlements in Middle-earth. Before the Downfall the population of
Númenor itself may have been as many as 15 million.[^583]

The Edain brought with them much lore, and the knowledge of many crafts,
and numerous craftsmen who had learned from the Eldar, directly or
through their fathers, besides preserving lore and traditions of their
own.

Many things made could of course be so used: axes, and spears, and bows.
The bowyers were a great craft. They made bows of many kinds: long bows,
and smaller bows, especially those used for shooting from horse-back;
and they also devised cross-bows, at first used mainly against predatory
birds. Shooting with bows was one of the great sports and pastimes of
men; and one in which young women also took part. The Númenórean men,
being tall and powerful, could shoot with speed and accuracy upon foot
from great long bows, whose shafts would carry to great distance (some
600 yards or more), and at lesser range were of great penetration. In
later days, in the wars upon Middle-earth, it was the bows of the
Númenóreans that were most greatly feared.

hints of the later shadows appeared before that. Indeed it was their
very arming to take part in the defence of the Eldar and Men of the West
of Middle-earth against the wielder of the Shadow (at length revealed as
Sauron the Great) that brought about the end of their peace and content.
Victory was the herald of their Downfall.[]{#calibre_link-1872

\[The Drúedain's\] knowledge of all growing things was almost equal to
that of the Elves (although untaught by them), discerning those that
were poisonous, or useful as medicaments, or good as food. To the
astonishment of Elves and other Men they ate funguses with pleasure,
many of which looked to others (Men and Hobbits) dangerous; some kinds
which they specially liked they caused to grow near their dwellings. The
Eldar did not eat these things. The Folk of Haleth, taught by the
Drúedain, made some use of them at need; and if they were guests they
ate what was provided in courtesy, and without fear. The other Atani
eschewed them, save in great hunger when astray in the wild, for few
among them had the knowledge to distinguish the wholesome from the bad,
and the less wise called them ork-plants and supposed them to have been
cursed and blighted by Morgoth.

::: ext
This text, written in a somewhat hasty hand in black nib-pen, occupies
three half-sides of the recto and verso of a folded sheet. It follows on
immediately from the text presented as text 2 in chap. XV, "Elvish
Reincarnation", in part two of this book, and appears to be contemporary
with that text, thus likewise dating from c. 1959.
:::

::: ext
The Númenórean Catastrophe & End of "Physical" Aman[^584]
:::

Is Aman "removed" or destroyed at the Catastrophe?

It *was* physical. Therefore it could not be removed, without remaining
visible as part of Arda or as a new satellite! It must either remain as
a landmass bereft of its former inhabitants or be destroyed.

I think now that it is best that it should *remain* a physical
*landmass* (America!). But as Manwë had already said to the Númenóreans:
"It is not the *land* that is hallowed (and free of death), but it is
hallowed by the dwellers there" -- the Valar.

It would just become *an ordinary land*, an addition to Middle-earth,
the European-African-Asiatic contiguous landmass. The *flora and fauna*
(even if different in some \[?items\] from those of Middle-earth) would
become ordinary beasts and plants with usual conditions of mortality.

*Aman and Eressëa* would be the memory of the *Valar and Elves* of the
former land.

[]{#calibre_link-1875 aria-label="345" role="doc-pagebreak"}The
Catastrophe would no doubt do great damage and change to the
configuration of Aman. Partly, especially on West \[*sic*; read
"East"?\] side, sunk into Sea.

But how then would the corporeal union of *fëar* and *hröar* be
maintained in an Aman of memory only?

The answer, I think, is this.

The *Catastrophe* represents a definite *intervention* of *Eru* and
therefore in a sense a change of the primal plan. *It is a foretaste of
the End of Arda.* The situation is much later than "conversation of
Finrod and Andreth"[^585] and could not then be foreseen by anyone, *not
even Manwë*. In a sense Eru moved forward the *End of Arda* as far as it
concerned the Elves. They had fulfilled their function -- and we
approach the "Dominion of Men". Hence the vast importance of the
*marriages* of Beren and Tuor -- *providing continuity of the Elvish
element*! The tales of the *Silmarillion* and especially of *Númenor*
and *the Rings* are in a *twilight*. We do not *see* as it were a
catastrophic end, but viewed against the enormous stretch of ages the
*twilight period* of 2^nd^/3^rd^ Ages is surely quite short and abrupt!

The Elves are *dying.* They whether in Aman or outside will become
*fëar* housed only in *memory* until the true End of Arda. They must
await the issue of the War \[?and\] only then; and of their *redemption*
foreglimpsed by Finrod:[^586] for their true returning (corporeal or in
Eru's equivalent!) in Arda Remade.

NB Melkor (*inside* Eä) only really becomes evil after the achievement
of Eä in which he played a great and powerful part (and in its early
stages in accord with the fundamental Design of Eru). It was jealousy of
Manwë and desire to dominate the Eruhíni that drove him mad. It was the
matter of Arda (as a whole but particularly of *Imbar*)[^587] that he
had corrupted. The Stars were not (or most of them were not) affected.

He became more and more incapable (like Ungoliantë!) of extricating
himself and finding scape in the vastness of Eä, and became more and
more physically involved in it.

::: ext
It is evident from the haste of his writing and the fluidity of his
conceptions that Tolkien is here thinking on paper (as he often did).
Not only does some of this thinking apparently contradict long-standing
"facts" of the then-unpublished mythology: e.g., the discord, envy, and
desire for dominance of Melkor -- in short, rebellion against Eru and
His design -- *during* the Music and *prior t*o entering Eä; but also
[]{#calibre_link-1876 aria-label="346" role="doc-pagebreak"}events
depicted in the already-published *Lord of the Rings*: e.g., Frodo's
bodily journey to a seemingly very physical Tol Eressëa.

Concerning Galadriel & Celeborn
:::

*Galadriel*: daughter of Finarphin and sister of Finrod (Felagund).
Quenya name *Alatáriel* 'blessed queen', Sindarized as *Galadriel*
(*galad* = 'bliss'). She wedded Celeborn (grandson of Elmo, brother of
Thingol)[^588] at about the end of the First Age. For love of Celeborn
(who did not wish to leave Middle-earth), at the downfall of Angband and
the ruin of Beleriand she crossed the Eryd Lindon into Eriador.
Celebrían was born c. S.A. 300; Amroth c. 350.[^589]

Eventually Galadriel and Celeborn, with a following mainly of Noldor
(but of course also Sindar and perhaps? some Nandor) established (c.
S.A. 750) the realm of Eregion west of the Misty Mountains, and
maintained friendship with the Dwarves of Moria. []{#calibre_link-1878
aria-label="348" role="doc-pagebreak"}They had access to the great
Nandorin realm on the other side of the Mountains (where afterwards
Lórien was: as a remnant of much greater woods joining up with Mirkwood
on both sides of Anduin). This realm was then called *Lōrinand* because
of its golden trees: 'Golden Vale' (N\[andorin\] *lōri* 'gold' = Q.
*laurë*); and also *Norlindon* -- because its people still called
themselves *Lindē* (*Lindar*) -- 'land of the Lindar'.[^590] The chief
craftsman of Eregion was Celebrimbor.

Galadriel and Celeborn are regarded as High Lord and Lady of all the
Eldar of the West.

Sauron visited the Elves; but was rejected by Gil-galad in S.A. 1200. He
visits Eregion and is rejected by Galadriel and Celeborn. He sees that
he has met his match (or at least a very serious adversary) in
Galadriel; he dissembles his wrath, and gets round Celebrimbor. The
Noldorin Smiths under Celebrimbor admit him and begin to learn from him
(so in a sense the story of Fëanor is repeated). Galadriel and Celeborn
leave Eregion c. S.A. 1300 and retreat (through Moria) to Lórinand (with
many of their *non*-Noldorin following): they are well received, and
teach to the Lindar many things, warning them especially against Sauron.

1697: At fall of Eregion many fleeing Elves come through (via Moria) and
swell the ranks of Sindarin speakers. The Lindar become more and more
Sindarized.

::: ext
The text ends here, at the bottom of a page;[^591] but on the next page
Tolkien begins an expanded account of Celebrimbor's dealings with
Sauron:
:::

But Sauron was more successful with the Ñoldor of Eregion, especially
with Celebrimbor (secretly anxious to rival the skill and fame of
Fëanor). When Sauron visited Eregion he sees quickly that he has met his
match in Galadriel -- or at least that in her he would have a chief
obstacle. So he concentrated on Celebrimbor; and soon had all the Smiths
of Eregion under his influence. Eventually he gets them to revolt
against Celeborn and Galadriel. These pass through Moria and take refuge
in Lórinand (c. S.A. 1350).

When Celebrimbor discovers the designs of Sauron and repents -- and
hides the Three Rings -- Sauron invades Eriador from the south, and
besieges Eregion. Celeborn and Amroth with Nandor and Dwarves come
through Moria to the west. Gilgalad sends help under Elrond from Lindon.
But he is not in time to assist much. Sauron breaks into Eregion and
lays it waste. Celebrimbor is slain personally by Sauron, but Sauron
does not get the Three Rings. His wrath now []{#calibre_link-1879
aria-label="349" role="doc-pagebreak"}blazes. Elrond with all (the few)
refugees from Eregion he can gather fight a vanguard action and draw
away N.W. He founds a stronghold in Imladris.

When Celeborn heard of onset of Sauron (fearing to keep the Three Rings
himself) he sent one to Galadriel in Lórinand by Amroth. Celeborn makes
a sortie and breaks out and joins Elrond but cannot get back.

::: ext
In the top margin of this page Tolkien made various calculations based
on the dates cited in this text, and corresponding time-spans in *yéni*
(the "long years" of the Elves, equating to 144 solar years). These
accompanied the following statement:
:::

Amroth was already prince in S.A. 850, only 32 *yên* \[when he\] passed
in T.A. 1981.[^592]

::: ext
In the accompanying calculations it can be discerned that Tolkien
assigned his birth to S.A. 750, and that Amroth was thus 32 *yéni* plus
64 solar years = 4,672 solar years old when he passed. A different
chronology, in which Amroth is made somewhat older at his passing, is
worked out in the left-hand margin:
:::

Amroth born S.A. 300. 2 in S.A. 588. In S.A. 1350 he was 29. In S.A.
1697 he was 31. In S.A. 3441 nearly 44 (43/117). In T.A. 1693 \[he was\]
11/109 older = 55/82.

::: ext
These ages, however (with the exception of the first, being precisely 2
*yéni* after S.A. 300), cannot be reconciled with a *yên* of 144 solar
years. The accounting of Amroth's ages through the end of the Second Age
in 3441 must refer rather to an apparent age, in terms of human
maturation, not actual age in *yéni* (e.g., in S.A. 1350 Amroth would
have been just over 7 *yéni* old, not 29; and in S.A. 3441 he would have
been just under 22 *yéni* old, not 44).[^593] As is shown in part one of
this book, the intertwined issues of the age and maturation rate of the
Elves, and implications for the chronology, occupied Tolkien greatly in
his later years.

In the top margin of the (apparently much later) cover page, above the
prominent title, Tolkien very roughly wrote (and then struck through)
the following:
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1880 aria-label="350" role="doc-pagebreak"}Galadriel is
made *sister* of Finrod. In youth she was fond of wandering afar. She
often visited the Teleri of Alqualondë (her mother was sister of Olwë
and Elwë). There she was often a companion of Teleporno ('silver-tall').
Celeborn's kinship from a younger brother of Olwë and Elwë: Nelwë.

Account of Galadriel's quarrel with the sons of Fëanor at sack of
Alqualondë. How she fought with Celeborn. She nonetheless went into
Exile because though she did not love the sons of Fëanor she was
personally proud and rebellious and wished for freedom.

::: ext
The Names *Galadriel*, *Celeborn* & *Lórien*[^594]
:::

The name *Alatáriel* is Telerin in form; its original meaning was 'maid
of the glittering coronal'. It was a compound of three elements, in
Common Eldarin (C.E.) form (1) \**ñalatā* 'a glitter' (of reflected
light); (2) the base RIȜ 'to wreathe'; (3) the feminine suffix \*-*el*,
-*elle*. From \**rīȝā* and the suffix was made the word \**rīȝelle* 'a
woman bearing a garland', specially applied to maidens wearing garlands
at festivals. In Telerin initial *ñ* was lost; and with loss of medial ȝ
and shortening of the word at the end of long names *-riel* was
produced; the whole name thus became Alatáriel.[^595]

The name *Telepornë* is also Telerin in form. It meant 'silver tree'. It
was a compound of C.E. \**kyelep-* 'silver' and \**ornē* 'tree'
(originally and usually applied to the taller, straighter, and more
slender trees, such as birches),[^596] a noun form related to the adj.
\**ornā* 'uprising, tall' (and straight). C.E. \**kyelep-* became in T.
*telep-*. In Sindarin its form was *celeb*. Its true Quenya form was
*tyelpë*, *tyelep-* (as in the surname of Írildë, S. *Idril*:
*tyeleptalëa* 'silver-footed'). This was still the form in Old Quenya,
and survived in many old names; but later the form *telpë* became usual.
This was due to the influence of Telerin. The Teleri prized silver above
gold; and their skill as silversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor.
For a similar reason *Telperion* was more generally used than
*Tyelperion* as the name of the White Tree of Valinor. This
[]{#calibre_link-1881 aria-label="351" role="doc-pagebreak"}was held in
great honour by the Teleri (who it is said devised its name), though the
Vanyar and Noldor gave greater love to Laurelin the Golden.

The base \**ñal-* fell out of use in Quenya, surviving only in the
derivatives *ñalda* 'bright, polished', and *angal* 'a mirror' from
\**aññala* (cf. *Angal-limpe* 'Mirrormere').[^597] There was no Quenya
form of C.E. \**ñalatā* (it would have been *\*ñalta*).

These names were later given a Sindarin form in Middle-earth. This
presented no difficulty, and the names became naturally *Galadriel* and
*Celeborn*. But when later Celeborn and Galadriel became the rulers of
the Elves of Lórien (who were mainly in origin Silvan Elves and called
themselves the Galaðrim) the name of Galadriel became associated with
trees, an association that was aided by the name of her husband,
Celeborn, which also appeared to contain a tree-word (his name was
however in fact derived from \**ornā* 'upraised, high, tall', of
stature),[^598] so that outside Lórien among those whose memories of the
ancient days and Galadriel's history had grown dim her name was often

*Lórien* is probably an alteration of an older name now lost. It is
actually the Quenya name of a region in Valinor, often also used as the
name of the Vala to whom it belonged: it was a place of rest and shadowy
trees and fountains, a retreat from cares and griefs. The resemblance
cannot be accidental. The alteration of the older name may well have
been due to Galadriel herself. As may be seen generally, and especially
in her song (I 389),[^600] she had endeavoured to make Lórien a refuge
and an island of peace and beauty, a memorial of ancient days, but was
now filled with regret and misgiving, []{#calibre_link-1882
aria-label="352" role="doc-pagebreak"}knowing that the golden dream was
hastening to a grey awakening. It may be noted that Treebeard (II
70)[^601] interprets *Loth-lórien* as 'Dreamflower'.

A Gondorian commentator states that the older name was *Lawarind*. He
names no authority; but it seems likely. It probably contains the C.E.
stem \**(g)lawar-* 'golden light', and is a derivative that in Quenya
form would be \**laware-nde* \> *laurende* (with the suffix frequent in
place-names): cf. Q. *laure*, S. *glawar*, T. *glavare.* The reference
was to the mallorn-trees. Treebeard also says that the earlier name
given by the Elves was *Laurelindórenan*. This is very likely a
composition in Treebeard's manner of *Laurelinde-nan(do)*, and
*Laure-ndóre*, both Quenya names and probably also due to Galadriel. The
second contains -*ndor* 'land'; the first is assimilated to
*Laure-linde* (meaning more or less 'singing gold'), the name of the
Golden Tree of Valinor. Both are easily taken as based on \**lawarind*
and alterations of it to resemble the names of Valinor, for which
Galadriel's yearning had increased as the years passed to an
overwhelming regret. *Lórien* was the name most used since in form it
could be Sindarin.[^602]

The element -*nan* 'valley' was derived from C.E. base NAD 'hollow' of
structures or natural features more or less concave with rising
sides.[^603] In Sindarin this gave *nand* which as other words ending in
*nd* remained in stressed monosyllables but \> *nann* \> *nan* in
compounds.[^604]

*Galadhon*, only in *Caras Galadhon*, which evidently meant 'Fortress of
the Trees'; but the word *caras* is not found in Sindarin: it may derive
from the same Silvan dialect as the reported name *Lawarind*, and be
related to Q. *caraxë*, applied to a defensive earth wall surmounted by
sharp stakes or standing stones; though in Caras Galadhon the palisade
had disappeared and only the deep moat remained outside the great wall
reinforced by stone. The adjectival/genitival *-on* is not
Sindarin,[^605] and was probably taken over from the older Silvan name
of what was no doubt originally a much more []{#calibre_link-1883
aria-label="353" role="doc-pagebreak"}primitive structure, though the
first element was Sindarized -- the tree word was probably still
recognizable as a descendant of C.E. \**galada* (Q. *alda*, T. *galada*,
S. *galað*).[]{#calibre_link-1884 aria-label="354"

Nomenclature

Silvan Elvish (SE), and names recorded as being derived from (dialects
of) that language.
:::

This language was evidently related to Sindarin; but its characteristics
have not been defined. For (as may be supposed) little information is
available, beyond a few personal names and place names. The Wood-elves
played a valiant part in the War of the Ring, []{#calibre_link-1888
aria-label="358" role="doc-pagebreak"}but appear to have given no
assistance in the ancient War of the Three Jewels.[^606]

In the fragmentary survivals of the legends of the Great Journey there
are mentions of several secessions from the march, either by accident
(some small parties lost their way) or by deliberate abandonment of the
journey through weariness and loss of hope. For the most part these
secessions were made by groups of the Lindar, the most numerous of the
Eldar, who had been the most reluctant to leave their ancient home, and
marched more slowly westward, always in the rear.[^607] [^608] The Eldar
of Ossiriand, the Green Elves, though wood-dwellers, were of quite
different origin, which does not here concern us; they were probably in
origin of Noldorin kinship.[^609] The Wood-elves of the time of the War
of the Ring appear to have been those Teleri and their descendants who
were dismayed by the Hithaeglir or Misty Mountains[^610] and abandoning
the march settled in the then greater and denser forests between the
Anduin and the mountains, in the region in later days bounded north and
south by the rivers Gladden and Limlight.[^611] How the Eldar had
crossed the Anduin is not told,[^612] but the legends appear to describe
that river as very different from its later shape in that region: wider
and slower and forming great lakes at intervals in what were afterward
the grassy lands of the Vales of Anduin. Such land would be attractive
to the Lindar, who from their earliest days had a greater love of water
than the other kindreds, and had already devised small boats to row or
sail on the lakes of their own land before the days of the Great
Journey. It was no doubt by their craft that eventually all three hosts
reached the feet of the mountains and were faced by the labour and
perils of finding ways through them. The legends speak of a sojourn of
many years and long debates before the Vanyar and Noldor after long
exploration began the crossing "by the pass under the Red
Mountain".[^613] They were followed by some two-thirds of the Teleri. A
third, mainly belonging to the folk of Olwë, had become during the delay
well contented, and []{#calibre_link-1889 aria-label="359"
role="doc-pagebreak"}remained behind. There was no contact between these
Silvan Elves and the Grey Elves, the Sindar, who in the event also
remained in Middle-earth and never crossed the Great Sea, until the
Second Age and the ruin of Beleriand. In Mannish terms that was a time
as long maybe as all the years that now lie between us and the War of
the Ring.[^614] Any tongues of Men, however close akin, would in such a
time have diverged beyond recognition. It was not so with the Elvish
languages. They changed indeed, in Middle-earth at any rate, in much the
same ways as do our languages, but much more slowly. For as Elvish sight
and hearing were limited in range as ours are, and yet were keener and
of greater range, so were their memories of things seen and heard. In
the First Age after the end of the Great Journey, in a thousand years
the unheeded change in the speech of the Elves that remained "on the
hither shores", that is in Middle-earth, was no more than in two
generations of Men.[^615] Thus, although the dialects of the Silvan
Elves, when they again met their long separated kindred, had so far
diverged from Sindarin as to be hardly intelligible, little study was
needed to reveal their kinship as Eldarin tongues.[^616] Though the
comparison of the Silvan dialects with their own speech greatly
interested the loremasters, especially those of Noldorin origin, little
is now known of the Silvan Elvish. The Silvan Elves had invented no
forms of writing, and those who learned this art from the Sindar wrote
in Sindarin as well as they could. By the end of the Third Age the
Silvan tongues had probably ceased to be spoken in the two regions that
had importance at the time of the War of the Ring: Lórien and the realm
of Thranduil in northern Mirkwood. All that survived of them in the
records was a few words and several names of persons and places.[^617]

Those names that are Elvish (at least in form) in the North East may
naturally be supposed to have been originally devised in the Silvan
tongue of Thranduil's realm, which had extended into the woods
surrounding the Lonely Mountain, before the coming of the Dwarves in
exile from Moria, and the invasions of the Dragons []{#calibre_link-1890
aria-label="360" role="doc-pagebreak"}of the far North. The Elvish folk
of this realm had migrated from the south, being the kin and neighbours
of the Elves of Lórien, but they had dwelt east of Anduin. Their
movement had at first been slow, and they had for a long time remained
in contact with their kin west of the river. Their unrest did not begin
until the Third Age. They had been little concerned in the wars of the
Second Age; but in that age they had grown to a numerous people, and
their king Oropher[^618] led a great host to join Gilgalad in the Last
Alliance; but he was slain and many of his following in the first
assault upon Mordor.[^619] Afterwards they lived in peace, until a
thousand years of the Third Age had passed. Then as they said a Shadow
fell upon Greenwood the Great and they retreated before it as it spread
ever northward, until at last Thranduil established his realm in the
North-east of the forest and delved there a fortress and great halls
underground.[^620], [^621] Maybe now more than 500 years had passed
between the loss of all communication between []{#calibre_link-1891
aria-label="361" role="doc-pagebreak"}Thranduil's folk and their
southern kindred before disaster befell Lórien and their last king,
Amroth, was lost. In that time their Silvan tongue would have suffered
no perceptible changes.

In the records of the Third Age all that remains of the Silvan language
is a few local words and several names of persons and places. These are
mostly derived from Lórien; but the names that are Elvish in form found
in the Northeast must have originally been devised in the Silvan tongue
of King Thranduil's realm, which had extended into the woods surrounding
the Lonely Mountain and growing along the west shores of the Long Lake,
before the coming of the Dwarves exiled from Moria and the invasion of
the dragon.

\[Thranduil\] had not long returned when the disaster of the Gladden
Fields occurred. When he retreated from the War in the first year of the
Third Age he heard ill news: the Orks of the north regions of the Misty
Mountains had also multiplied and spread southwards and many had crossed
the Anduin and were infesting the eaves of Greenwood.

The history of the Orks is naturally obscure and whence these Orks had
come is not known. In the final destruction of Thangorodrim and the
casting out of Morgoth, their begetter, those in his immediate service
had been destroyed, though no doubt some escaped and fled east into
hiding. But in the Second Age Sauron, when he turned back to evil, had
gathered to his service all the Orks that were scattered far and wide in
the Northern world, cowed and masterless, furtive lurkers in dark
places. He rekindled the lusts of their black hearts; and to some
[]{#calibre_link-1892 aria-label="362" role="doc-pagebreak"}he showed
favour and fed them lavishly, breeding and training them into tribes of
strong and cruel warriors.

In the Second Age the presence of the lesser and more furtive Orks in
the mountains between Carn Dûm and the Ettenmoors had long been known to
the Elves and the Dúnedain; but they were not yet much troubled by
them.[^624] These Orks feared the Elves and fled from them; and they did
not dare to approach the dwellings of Men or to assail them on their
journeys, unless a lone man or a few rash adventurers strayed near their
hiding places. But things had changed. While the greater part of the
strength of Elves and Men had been drawn away south to the war with
Mordor, they had become more bold and their scattered tribes had become
leagued together and had dug a deep stronghold beneath Mount Gundabad.
Slowly they were creeping southward.

But these Orks could not have caused the disaster of the Gladden Fields;
they would not have dared even to show themselves to Isildur. For though
he was marching north with only a small company, maybe no more than two
hundreds,[^625], [^626] they were his picked bodyguard, tall knights of
the Dúnedain, war-hardened, grim and fully armed.[^627] There can be no
doubt that Sauron, well informed of the Alliance and the gathering of
great forces to assail him, had sent out such troops of Orks as

In L.R. I 355[^629] Legolas speaks of this custom \[dwelling in trees\]
as if it was universal among the Galadhrim of Lórien, and was used "even
before the Shadow came",[^630] but it was not in fact a habit of the
Silvan Elves in general. It was developed in Lórien by the nature and
situation of the land: a flat land with no good stone, except what might
be quarried in the mountains westward and brought with difficulty down
the Celebrant.[^631] Its chief wealth was in its trees, a remnant of the
great forests of the Elder Days, of which the chief were the great
*mellyrn* ('golden-trees') of vast girth and immense height. East and
west the land was bounded by the Anduin and by the mountains, but it had
no clearly defined borders northward and southward.

::: ext
The text continues with the excerpt given at UT:260--1, resuming with:
:::

But in the later days of which we speak Lórien had been a land of uneasy
vigilance. The dwelling in trees was not universal. The *telain* or
'flets' were in origin either refuges in trees to be used in cases of
[]{#calibre_link-1894 aria-label="364" role="doc-pagebreak"}attack or
invasion, or most often (especially those high up in great trees)
outlook posts from which the land and its borders could be surveyed by
Elvish eyes. Such an outlook post, used by the wardens of the north
marches, was the flet in which Frodo spent the night. The abode of
Celeborn in Caras Galadon was also of the same origin: its highest flet,
which the Fellowship of the Ring did not see, was the highest point in
the land. Earlier the great flet of Amroth at the top of the great mound
or hill of Cerin Amroth (piled by the labour of many hands) had been the
highest, and was principally designed to watch Dol Guldur across the
Anduin. The conversion of these telain into permanent dwellings was a
later development, and only in Caras Galadon were such dwellings
numerous. But Caras Galadon was itself a fortress, and only a small part
of the Galadhrim dwelt within its walls. Living in such lofty houses was
no doubt at first thought remarkable, and Amroth was probably the first
to do so.[^632] It is thus from his living in a high *talan* that his
name -- the only one that was later remembered in legend -- was most
probably derived.

If so it is connected with a stem RATH meaning 'climb' -- with hands and
feet, as in a tree or up a rocky slope. This is recorded in Quenya only
in *raþillo* (*rasillo*) 'squirrel' and *rantala* 'ladder' (\<
\**ranthlā*).[^633] In Lindarin *rath-* was still the stem of a normal
"strong" verb 'to climb'; a (professional or habitual) climber was
*rathumo*, but in compounds the agental form was *-rathō*, as in
*orotrātho* 'mountain-climber'. In Sindarin, clearly connected
derivatives are not found.[^634]

Both Quenya and Lindarin also possessed a word *ratta*, which might be a
derivative (by lengthening the medial consonant, a frequent device in
Primitive Eldarin) from either \**rattha* or \**ratta* from the stem
RAT,[^635] [^636]\] and in senses seems to be a blend of both. It meant
'a track'; though often applied to ways known to mountaineers, to
[]{#calibre_link-1895 aria-label="365" role="doc-pagebreak"}passes in
the mountains and the climbing ways to them, it was not confined to
ascents. It could be used of tracks across a marshland, or trails
(blazed or sometimes marked by guide-stones) in forests. This is
evidently the origin also of S. *rath*, the short vowel of which shows
that it had a double consonant medially and was not derived from a
simple form of RAT such as \**rathā*. It had the same senses as Q., L.
*ratta*, though in mountainous country it was most used of climbing
ways. In Minas Tirith, in the Númenórean Sindarin that was used in
Gondor for the nomenclature of places, *rath* had become virtually
equivalent to 'street', being applied to nearly all the paved ways
within the city. Most of these were on an incline, often steep.

The naming had probably come down from the early days of Gondor when the
rocky hill of Amon Anor was yet uninhabited, except by a small fort on
its summit reached by winding paths and rough-hewn steps. It was in
those days of less importance than Minas Ithil, the centre of the Watch
that was kept on the deserted land of Mordor. The chief purpose of the
fort (Minas Anor) was then to guard the place of the Tombs of the Kings
which were built on a long pier of rock which joined the outlier, Amon
Anor, to the main mass of the great Mindolluin behind it. Thus one of
the oldest of the *raths* of Minas Tirith must have been the steep
winding way that led down to the Tombs and then along the rocky way
between them: the Rath Dínen, the Silent Street, as it was called;
though in the time of the L.R. this name was applied only to the great
way between the numerous tombs. The ancient *rath* had been replaced by
a broad winding way, cut in the rock of the hill, that wound down
without steps, and fenced on the outward edge with a low wall and carved
balusters: *Dúnad in Gyrth*, the Descent of the
Dead.[]{#calibre_link-1896 aria-label="366"

Note on the delay of Gil-galad and the Númenóreans\
in attacking Sauron, *before* he could gather his forces.
:::

It is now vain, and indeed unjust, to judge them foolish not to do, as
in the end they were obliged to do, to have quickly gathered their
forces and assailed Sauron. (See the *Debate of the Loremasters upon the
Ban of Manwë* and his conduct as the Lord of Arda.)[^637] They could not
have any certain knowledge of Sauron's intentions, or his power, and it
was one of the successes of his cunning and deceits that they were
unaware of his actual weakness, and his need for a long time in which to
gather armies sufficient to assail an alliance of the Elves and Western
Men. His occupation of Mordor he no doubt would have kept secret if he
could, and it would appear from later events that he had secured the
allegiance of Men that dwelt in lands adjacent, even those west of
Anduin, in those regions where afterwards was Gondor in the Ered Nimrais
and Calenardhon. But the Númenóreans occupying the Mouths of Anduin and
the shorelands of Lebennin had discovered his devices, and revealed them
to Gil-galad. But until \[S.A.\] 1600 he was still using the disguise of
beneficent friend, and often journeyed at will in Eriador with few
attendants, and so could not risk any rumour that he was gathering
armies. At this time he []{#calibre_link-1901 aria-label="371"
role="doc-pagebreak"}perforce neglected the East (where Morgoth's
ancient power had been) and though his emissaries were busy among the
multiplying tribes of eastern Men, he dared not permit any of them to
come within sight of the Númenóreans, or of Western Men.[^638]

The Orcs of various kind (creatures of Morgoth) were to prove the most
numerous and terrible of his soldiers and servants; but great hosts of
them had been destroyed in the war against Morgoth, and in the
destruction of Beleriand. Some remnant had escaped to hidings in the
northern parts of the Misty Mountains and the Grey Mountains, and were
now multiplying again. But further East there were more and stronger
kinds, descendants of Morgoth's kingship, but long masterless during his
occupation of Thangorodrim, they were yet wild and ungovernable, preying
upon one another and upon Men (whether good or evil). But not until
Mordor and the Barad-dûr were ready could he allow them to come out of
hiding, while the Eastern Orcs, who had not experienced the power and
terror of the Eldar, or the valour of the Edain, were not subservient to
Sauron -- while he was obliged for the cozening of Western Men and Elves
to wear as fair a form and countenance as he could, they despised him
and laughed at him. Thus it was that though, as soon as his disguise was
pierced and he was recognized as an enemy, he exerted all his time and
strength to gathering and training armies, it took some ninety years
before he felt ready to open war. And he misjudged this, as we see in
his final defeat, when the great host of Minastir from Númenor landed in
Middle-earth. His gathering of armies had not been unopposed, and his
success had been much less than his hope. But this is a matter spoken of
in notes on "The Five Wizards".[^639] He had powerful enemies behind his
back, the East, and in the Southern lands to which he had not yet given
sufficient thought.

It is false to make Dwarves \[?uncreative\] or poor linguists. They had
great interest in languages -- which was more or less dormant until they
began to associate with other peoples -- but they could not conceal
their *voices*. Phonetically they were acute and could pronounce learned
languages well, but their voices were very deep in tone with laryngeal
coloration, and they among themselves spoke in a laryngeal whisper.

They started with a \[?purely\] spoken language \[?but????\]

But it is said in L.R. App[^640] that the *Cirth* were first devised in
Beleriand by the Sindar -- in a simple form they spread to the Dwarves;
the \[?elaborating\] of the Cirth under the influence of the Tengwar is
attributed to Daeron.

NB: the *invention* ascribed to Dwarves by Elrond[^641] was of the
invisible runes in moonletters only. All the same do not exaggerate
Dwarvish linguistic ability. Though devised by the Sindar (owing to
their enmity with the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost) it is probable
(and was held true by the Noldor) that the idea of runes cut in stone
etc. was derived ultimately from the Dwarves who had friendship with the
sons of Fëanor.

This typescript text, located in Tolkien's linguistic papers, is
associated with but now separated from the late text, *The Disaster of
the Gladden Fields* (UT:271--87).[^642] It is typed on the verso of a
sheet of a printed Allen & Unwin publication notice dated 1968. An
apparently later version was paraphrased and partially quoted at
UT:280--1 n.14, but this draft gives additional details on the history
of the Dwarf Road. In the *UT* text there is no indication that the
Dwarf Road extended south to Moria, but instead it descends from the
Pass of Imladris.
:::

The Dwarf Road, *Menn-i-Naugrim* had been made with great labour by the
Longbeard Dwarves of Moria and their kin in the Iron Hills (Emyn Engrin)
in the North-east.[^643] The Dwarves of Moria had made a road from their
gates north along the east skirts of the Misty Mountains, over the upper
course of the Gladden, and so to the lowest point at which the Anduin
could be bridged, somewhat above the beginning of its sudden descent.
There they built a stone-bridge from which the Dwarf Road ran, straight
and due east, across the vale and through the Forest to a bridge across
the Celduin (River Running) made by the Dwarves of the Iron Hills,
whence it ran on over open land, north-east to their iron mines.[^644]

The making of the bridges and the first miles of the road through the
forest was work of the First Age; the road was completed early in the
Second Age when the population of Moria (and to a less extent also of
the Iron Mines) was much increased by emigrants from the mansions in the
Ered Luin. There was great traffic on the road in those days, until the
forging of the Great Ring and the war between []{#calibre_link-1904
aria-label="374" role="doc-pagebreak"}Sauron and the Elves and their
Númenórean allies, in which the Dwarves of Moria became involved because
of their close friendship with the Noldor of Eregion. Sauron's power was
however not full grown, and was far to the south and east. He invaded
Eriador from the south and did not greatly trouble the north-lands.

## [FROM *THE HUNT FOR THE RING*](#calibre_link-798){.toc-link} {#from-the-hunt-for-the-ring .chapter-title1}

::: ext
This text, written in a clear hand in brown nib-pen, is associated with
the mass of writings that Christopher Tolkien published as *The Hunt for
the Ring* in *Unfinished Tales*, and describes as being "written after
the publication of the first volume \[of *The Lord of the Rings*\] but
before that of the third" (UT:11). Cf. LR:1091. The two Nazgûl involved
are distinguished here as "E" (elsewhere identified as Khamûl, UT:348)
and "F'.
:::

Sat. Sept. 24 \[3018\]. (Gandalf speeds across Enedwaith.) E picks up
the Stock Road and overtakes Frodo at approaches to Woody End --
probably by accident; he becomes uneasily aware of the Ring, but is
hesitant and uncertain because of the bright sun. He turns into the
woods and waits for night. After dark, becoming acutely aware of the
Ring, he goes in pursuit; but is daunted by the sudden appearance of the
Elves and the song of Elbereth.[^645] While Frodo is surrounded by the
Elves he cannot perceive the Ring clearly.

Sun. 25^th^. As soon as the Elves depart he renewed his hunt, and
reaching the ridge above Woodhall is aware that the Ring has been there.
Failing to find the Bearer and feeling that he is drawing away, E
summons F by cries. E is aware of the general direction that the Ring
has taken, but not knowing of Frodo's rest in the wood, and believing
him to have made straight eastwards, he and F ride over the fields. They
visit Maggot while Frodo is still under the trees. E then makes a
mistake (probably because he imagines the Ringbearer as some mighty man,
strong and swift): he does not lurk near the farm, but sends F *down*
the Causeway towards Overbourn, while he goes []{#calibre_link-1906
aria-label="376" role="doc-pagebreak"}north along it towards the Bridge.
They tryst to return and meet one another at night; but do so just too
late. F joins him soon after.

E is now well aware that the Ring has crossed the river; but the river
is a barrier to his sense of movement. Also E and F (and all the Nazgûl)
hate water; and they will not touch the Baranduin: its waters were to
them "elvish", for it rose in Nenuial, which the Elves still controlled.
(Frodo spends night at Crickhollow; Gandalf is drawing near to Tharbad.)

::: ext
This text has been previously published in *Vinyar Tengwar* 42 (2001). I
describe and present it here much as I did in *VT*, though I have
reduced considerably the more strictly linguistic and etymological
content and (my own) commentary, without indication, and updated the
editorial cross-references to *The Lord of the Rings* to match the
current standard edition (which has continuous page-numbering).

This historical and etymological essay, titled only "*Nomenclature*" by
its author, belongs with other, similar writings that Christopher
Tolkien has dated to c. 1967--9 (XII:293--4) -- including *Of Dwarves
and Men*, *The Shibboleth of Fëanor*, and *The History of Galadriel and
Celeborn* -- and that were published, in whole or in part, in
*Unfinished Tales* and *The Peoples of Middle-earth*. Indeed,
Christopher Tolkien gave numerous excerpts from this essay as well in
*Unfinished Tales*. He prepared a fuller presentation of the text for
*The Peoples of Middle-earth*, but it was omitted from that volume on
consideration of length. Christopher kindly provided me with both the
full text of the essay and of his own edited version intended for *The
Peoples of Middle-earth*. I have retained, with his gracious consent, as
much of Christopher's own commentary as practicable, clearly identified
as such throughout, while providing some additional commentary and notes
of my own.

The essay consists of thirteen typescript pages, numbered 1 to 13 by
Tolkien. A torn, unnumbered half-sheet bearing a manuscript
[]{#calibre_link-1908 aria-label="378" role="doc-pagebreak"}note headed
"*Far too complicated"* (amidst and referring to a lengthy, discursive
discussion of the Eldarin number system, in particular the explanation
of the numeral 5) was placed between pages 8 and 9 of the typescript.
Another unnumbered sheet follows the last page of the typescript,
bearing a manuscript note on the name *Belfalas* (which is paraphrased
at UT:247). All of these sheets are various forms of printed Allen &
Unwin notices, with Tolkien's writing confined to the blank sides,
except in the case of the last sheet. Here, the printed side was used
for manuscript drafting of Cirion's Oath in Quenya (already very near to
the published version; cf. UT:305), which was continued on the top
(relative to the printing) of the blank side. The note on *Belfalas* is
written upside-down beginning at the bottom of the sheet (with respect
to this drafting and the printing).

Concerning the origin and date of this essay, Christopher Tolkien
writes: "On 30 June 1969 my father wrote a letter to Mr Paul Bibire, who
had written to him a week before, telling him that he had passed the
Bachelor of Philosophy examination in Old English at Oxford: he referred
a little disparagingly to his success, achieved despite neglect of
certain parts of the course which he found less appealing, and notably
the works of the Old English poet Cynewulf (see *Sauron Defeated*, p.
285 note 36). At the end of his letter Mr Bibire said: 'Incidentally,
there's something that I've been wondering about since I saw the
relevant addition to the second edition \[of *The Lord of the Rings*\]:
whether the River Glanduin is the same as the Swanfleet' (for the
reference see *Sauron Defeated*, p. 70 and note 15)." Christopher
Tolkien has provided the relevant portions of his father's reply (which
was not included in the collection of letters edited with Humphrey
Carpenter):
:::

It was kind of you to write to me again. I was very interested in your
news of yourself, and very sympathetic. I found and find dear Cynewulf a
lamentable bore -- lamentable, because it is a matter for tears that a
man (or men) with talent in word-spinning, who must have heard (or read)
so much now lost, should spend their time composing such uninspired
stuff.[^646] Also at more than one point in my life I have endangered my
prospects by neglecting things that I did not at that time find amusing!
...

I am grateful to you for pointing out the use of *Glanduin* in the
Appendix A, III, p. 319.[^647] I have no index of the Appendices and
must get one made. The Glanduin is the same river as the Swanfleet, but
the names are not related. I find on the map with corrections that are
[]{#calibre_link-1909 aria-label="379" role="doc-pagebreak"}to be made
for the new edition to appear at the end of this year that this river is
marked by me as both Glanduin and various compounds with *alph*
'swan'.[^648] The name *Glanduin* was meant to be 'border-river', a name
given as far back as the Second Age when it was the southern border of
Eregion, beyond which were the unfriendly people of Dunland. In the
earlier centuries of the Two Kingdoms *Enedwaith* (Middle-folk) was a
region between the realm of Gondor and the slowly receding realm of
Arnor (it originally included Minhiriath (Mesopotamia)). Both kingdoms
shared an interest in the region, but were mainly concerned with the
upkeep of the great road that was their main way of communication except
by sea, and the bridge at Tharbad. People of Númenórean origin did not
live there, except at Tharbad, where a large garrison of soldiers and
river-wardens was once maintained. In those days there were drainage
works, and the banks of the Hoarwell and Greyflood were strengthened.
But in the days of *The Lord of the Rings* the region had long become
ruinous and lapsed into its primitive state: a slow wide river running
through a network of swamps, pools and eyots: the haunt of hosts of
swans and other water-birds.

If the name Glanduin was still remembered it would apply only to the
upper course where the river ran down swiftly, but was soon lost in the
plains and disappeared into the fens. I think I may keep Glanduin on the
map for the upper part, and mark the lower part as fenlands with the
name *Nîn-in-Eilph* (water-lands of the Swans), which will adequately
explain Swanfleet river, III.263.[^649]

*alph* 'swan' occurs as far as I remember only on III, p. 392.[^650] It
could not be Quenya, as *ph* is not used in my transcription of Quenya,
and Quenya does not tolerate final consonants other than the dentals,
*t*, *n*, *l*, *r* after a vowel.[^651] Quenya for 'swan' was *alqua
(alkwā)*. The "Celtic" branch of Eldarin (Telerin and Sindarin) turned
*kw* \> *p*, but did not, as Celtic did, alter original *p*. The much
changed Sindarin of Middle-earth turned the stops to spirants after *l*,
*r*, as did Welsh: so \**alkwā* \> *alpa* (Telerin) \> S. *alf* (spelt
alph in my transcription).[^652]

::: ext
At the end of the letter Tolkien added a postscript:
:::

I am myself much recovered -- though it has taken a year, which I could
ill afford.[^653] I can walk about fairly normally now, up to two miles
or so (occasionally), and have some energy. But not enough to cope with
both continued composition and the endless "escalation" of my business.

::: ext
[]{#calibre_link-1910 aria-label="380" role="doc-pagebreak"}At the head
of the present essay, Tolkien wrote "*Nomenclature*", followed by:
"Swanfleet river (L.R. rev. edition, III 263) and *Glanduin*, III App.
A. 319"; and then by: "Queried by P. Bibire (letter June 23, 1969; ans.
June 30). As more briefly stated in my reply: *Glanduin* means
'border-river'." The essay is thus seen to have arisen as an expansion
and elaboration of the remarks in his reply.
:::

::: ext
*The names of the Rivers*
:::

::: ext
The essay begins with the lengthy excerpt and author's note given at
UT:264--5 (and so not reproduced here). A few variances between the
published text and the typescript are noteworthy: where the published
text has *Enedwaith* the typescript reads *Enedhwaith* (this was an
editorial change made in all excerpts from this essay containing the
name in *Unfinished Tales*; cf. XII:328--9 n.66); and where the
published text has *Ethraid Engrin*, the typescript has *Ethraid
Engren*. In addition, a sentence referring to the ancient port called
Lond Daer Enedh was omitted before the last sentence of the author's
note on UT:264; it reads: "It was the main entry for the Númenóreans in
the War against Sauron (Second Age 1693--1701)" (cf. LR:1083; and
UT:239, 261--5). Also, against the discussion of the approach to Tharbad
that closes the first paragraph on UT:264, Tolkien provided the
cross-reference "I 287, 390".[^654]

Tolkien then comments: "The names of the Rivers give some trouble; they
were made up in a hurry without sufficient consideration", before
embarking upon a consideration of each name in turn. Significant
portions of this section of the essay have been given in *Unfinished
Tales*. Extended passages are not repeated here, but their places in the
essay are indicated.
:::

*Adorn*

This is not on the map, but is given as the name of the short river
flowing into the Isen[^655] from the west of Ered Nimrais in App. A, III
346.[^656] It is, as would be expected in any name in the region not of
Rohanese origin, of a form suitable to Sindarin; but it is not
interpretable in Sindarin. It must be supposed to be of Pre-Númenórean
origin adapted to Sindarin.[^657]

::: ext
Of this entry, Christopher Tolkien notes: "On the absence of the name on
the map -- referring of course to my original map to *The
[]{#calibre_link-1911 aria-label="381" role="doc-pagebreak"}Lord of the
Rings*, which was replaced long after by the redrawing made to accompany
*Unfinished Tales* -- see UT:261--2, footnote."
:::

*Gwathló*

Of the next entry, headed "*Gwathlo (ló)*", Christopher Tolkien writes:
"The long discussion arising from this name is found in UT:261--3, with
the passage concerning the Púkel-men removed and cited in the section on
the Drúedain, UT:383--4. In the latter passage the sentence 'Maybe even
in the days of the War of the Ring some of the Drú-folk lingered in the
mountains of Andrast, the western outlier of the White Mountains'
contains an editorial change: the original text has 'the mountains of
Angast (Long Cape)', and the form *Angast* occurs again more than once
in the essay. This change was based on the form *Andrast* communicated
by my father to Pauline Baynes for inclusion, with other new names, on
her decorated map of Middle-earth; see UT:261, footnote."[^658] A
further editorial change may be noted: where the published text has
*Lefnui* (UT:263, repeated in the extracted note on Púkel-men, UT:383)
the typescript reads *Levnui*; cf. the entry for *Levnui* below.

An unused note against "the great promontory ... that formed the north
arm of the Bay of Belfalas" (*ibid*.) reads: "Afterwards called still
*Drúwaith (Iaur)* '(Old) Púkel-land', and its dark woods were little
visited, nor considered as part of the realm of Gondor." Also, a
sentence struck through by Tolkien, following "huge trees ... under
which the boats of the adventurers crept silently up into the unknown
land", (UT:263), reads: "It is said that some even on this first
expedition came as far as the great fenlands before they returned,
fearing to become bewildered in their mazes."

The discussion originally continued with the following etymological
note, struck through at the same time as the deleted sentence:

The element *-ló* was also of Common Eldarin origin, derived from a base
*(s)log*: in Common Eldarin *sloga* had been a word used for streams of
a kind that were variable and liable to overflow their banks at seasons
and cause floods when swollen by rains or melting snow; especially such
as the Glanduin (described above) that had their sources in mountains
and fell at first swiftly, but were halted in the lower lands and flats.

::: ext
[]{#calibre_link-1912 aria-label="382" role="doc-pagebreak"}The deleted
passage was replaced with that given at UT:263 starting at "So the first
name they gave to it was 'River of Shadow', *Gwath-hîr*, *Gwathir*". It
may be noted that the word *lô* in this passage was corrected on the
typescript from *lhô*. A note on the name *Ringló*, omitted from the
passage in *Unfinished Tales*, occurs after the words "*Gwathló*, the
shadowy river from the fens". For this note, and its development, see
the entry for *Ringló* below. After this note, an etymological statement
intervenes before the last full paragraph of the excerpt published in
*Unfinished Tales*:
:::

*Gwath* was a common Sindarin word for 'shadow' or dim light -- not for
the shadows of actual objects or persons cast by sun or moon or other
lights: these were called *morchaint* 'dark-shapes'.

*Erui*

Though this was the first of the Rivers of Gondor it cannot be used for
'first'. In Eldarin *er* was not used in counting in series: it meant
'one, single, alone'. *erui* is not the usual Sindarin for 'single,
alone': that was *ereb* (\< *erikwa*; cf. Q. *erinqua*); but it has the
very common adjectival ending --*ui* of Sindarin. The name must have
been given because of the Rivers of Gondor it was the shortest and
swiftest and was the only one without a tributary.

*Serni*

Christopher Tolkien writes: "The statement about this name is given in
the Index to *Unfinished Tales*, but with a misprint that has never been
corrected: the Sindarin word meaning 'pebble' is *sarn*, not *sern*."
The opening sentence reads: "An adjectival formation from S. *sarn*
'small stone, pebble' (as described above), or a collective, the
equivalent of Q. *sarnie* (*sarniye*) 'shingle, pebble-bank'." An unused
sentence, occurring before "Its mouth was blocked with shingles", reads:
"It was the only one of the five to fall into the delta of the Anduin."

*Sirith*

This means simply 'a flowing': cf. *tirith* 'watching, guarding' from
the stem *tir-* 'to watch'.

[]{#calibre_link-1913 aria-label="383" role="doc-pagebreak"}*Celos*

Christopher Tolkien writes: "The statement about this name is given in
the Index to *Unfinished Tales*. On the erroneous marking of Celos on my
redrawn map of *The Lord of the Rings*, see VII:322 n. 9."

*Gilrain*

A significant portion of the remarks on this river name was given in
UT:242--5; but the discussion begins with a passage omitted from
*Unfinished Tales:*

This resembles the name of Aragorn's mother, *Gilraen*; but unless it is
misspelt must have had a different meaning. (Originally the difference
between correct Sindarin *ae* and *ai* was neglected, *ai* more usual in
English being used for both in the general narrative. So *Dairon*, now
corrected, for *Daeron* a derivative of S. *daer* 'large, great': C.E.
\**daira* \< base DAY; not found in Quenya. So *Hithaiglir* on map for
*Hithaeglir* and *Aiglos* \[for *Aeglos*\].)[^659] The element *gil-* in
both is no doubt S. *gil* 'spark, twinkle of light, star', often used of
the stars of heaven in place of the older and more elevated *el-,*
*elen-* stem. (Similarly *tinwë* 'spark' was also used in Quenya). The
meaning of *Gilraen* as a woman's name is not in doubt. It meant 'one
adorned with a tressure set with small gems in its network', such as the
tressure of Arwen described in L.R. I 239.[^660] It may have been a
second name given to her after she had come to womanhood, which as often
happened in legends had replaced her true name, no longer recorded. More
likely, it was her true name, since it had become a name given to women
of her people, the remnants of the Númenóreans of the North Kingdom of
unmingled blood. The women of the Eldar were accustomed to wear such
tressures; but among other peoples they were used only by women of high
rank among the "Rangers", descendants of Elros, as they claimed. Names
such as *Gilraen*, and others of similar meaning, would thus be likely
to become first names given to maid-children of the kindred of the
"Lords of the Dúnedain". The element *raen* was the Sindarin form of Q.
*raina* 'netted, enlaced'.

::: ext
In an accompanying etymological note Tolkien provides this detail
regarding S. *raen*, Q. *raina*:
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1914 aria-label="384" role="doc-pagebreak"}C.E. base
RAY 'net, knit, contrive network or lace'; also \[*deleted*: 'catch',\]
'involve in a network, enlace' ... The word was only applied to work
with a single thread; weaving with cross-threads or withes was
represented by the distinct base WIG.

::: ext
Of this note Christopher Tolkien writes: "*Tressure*, a net for
confining the hair, is a word of medieval English which my father had
used in his translation of *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight* (stanza
69): 'the clear jewels / that were twined in her tressure by twenties in
clusters', where the original has the form *tressour*."

The entry then continues:
:::

In *Gilrain* the element *-rain* though similar was distinct in origin.
Probably it was derived from base RAN 'wander, stray, go on uncertain
course', the equivalent of Q. *ranya*. This would not seem suitable to
any of the rivers of Gondor ...

::: ext
The portion given in *Unfinished Tales* begins here (p. 242). The final
sentence of the first extract from the discussion of *Gilrain* in UT:243
omits the ending; the whole sentence reads: "This legend \[of Nimrodel\]
was well-known in the Dor-en-Ernil (Land of the Prince) and no doubt the
name \[*Gilrain*\] was given in memory of it, or rendered in Elvish form
from an older name of the same meaning." Also omitted was the paragraph
following this sentence, which reads: "The flight of Nimrodel was dated
by the chronologists at Third Age 1981. An error in Appendix B appears
at this point. The correct entry read (still in 1963): 'The Dwarves flee
from Moria. Many of the Silvan Elves of Lórien flee south. Amroth and
Nimrodel are lost.' In subsequent editions or reprints 'flee from Moria
...' to 'Silvan Elves' has been for reasons unknown omitted." The
correct reading of this entry has been restored in later editions
(LR:1087). In addition, the first sentence of the following paragraph,
introducing the passage with which the extract given in *Unfinished
Tales* resumes (p. 243), reads: "At that time Amroth was, in the legend,
named as King of Lórien. How this fits with the rule of Galadriel and
Celeborn will be made clear in a precis of the history of Galadriel and
Celeborn." Finally, the last sentence of the last paragraph given on
UT:244 was omitted; it reads: "Communication was maintained constantly
with Lórien."

A typescript note appended after the first sentence on UT:245, against
the phrase "the sorrows of Lórien, which was now left without a ruler",
and subsequently struck through by Tolkien, reads:
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1915 aria-label="385" role="doc-pagebreak"}Amroth had
never taken a wife. For long years he had loved Nimrodel, but had sought
her love in vain. She was of Silvan race and did not love the Incomers,
who (she said) brought wars and destroyed the peace of old. She would
speak only the Silvan Tongue, even after it had fallen into disuse among
most of the people. But when the terror came out of Moria she fled away
distraught, and Amroth followed her. He found her near the eaves of
Fangorn (which in those days drew much nearer to Lórien). She dared not
enter that wood, for the trees (she said) menaced her, and some moved to
bar her way. There they had long converse; and in the end they plighted
their troth, for Amroth vowed that for her sake he would leave his
people even in their time of need and with her seek for a refuge of
peace. 'But there is no such"

::: ext
The deleted note ends here, in mid-sentence. As Christopher Tolkien
notes (UT:242), this passage is the germ of the version of the legend of
Amroth and Nimrodel given in UT:240--2.

The discussion of *Gilrain* concludes (following the first paragraph
given on UT:245) with this note:
:::

The river *Gilrain* if related to the legend of Nimrodel must contain an
element derived from C.E. RAN 'wander, stray, meander'. Cf. Q. *ranya*
'erratic wandering', S. *rein*, *rain*. Cf. S. *randír* 'wanderer' in
*Mithrandir*, Q. *Rána* name of the spirit (Máya) that was said to abide
in the Moon as its guardian.

*Ciril, Kiril*

Uncertain, but probably from KIR 'cut'. It rose in Lamedon and flowed
westward for some way in a deep rocky channel.

*Ringló*

For the element *-ló* see discussion of *Gwathló* above. But there is no
record of any swamps or marsh in its course. It was a swift (and cold)
river, as the element *ring-* \['cold'\] implies. It drew its first
waters from a high snowfield that fed an icy tarn in the mountains. If
this at seasons of snowmelting spread into a shallow lake, it would
account for the name, another of the many that refer to a river's
source.

::: ext
Cf. the entry *Ringló* in the index to *Unfinished Tales*. This
explanation of the name *Ringló* only arose in the course of the writing
of []{#calibre_link-1916 aria-label="386" role="doc-pagebreak"}this
essay; for in the discussion of *Gwathló* that Tolkien struck out he had
originally added this note:
:::

It the element *ló*\] appears also in the name *Ringló*, the fourth of
the Rivers of Gondor. It may be translated *Chillflood*. Coming down
cold from the snows of the White Mountains in swift course, after its
meeting with the Ciril and later with the Morthond it formed
considerable marshes before it reached the sea, though these were very
small compared with the fens of the Swanfleet (Nîn-in-Eilph) about
Tharbad.

::: ext
In the revised discussion of *Gwathló* (UT:263) this note was replaced
by the following:
:::

A similar name is found in *Ringló*, the fourth of the rivers of Gondor.
Named as several other rivers, such as Mitheithel and Morthond
(black-root), after its source *Ringnen* 'chill-water', it was later
called *Ringló*, since it formed a fenland about its confluence with the
Morthond, though this was very small compared with the Great Fen (*Lô
Dhaer*) of the Gwathló.

::: ext
Tolkien then struck out the latter part of this note (from "since it
formed a fenland" through the end), replacing it with a direction to see
the final explanation of *Ringló* given above, in which the element *lô*
is not derived from fenlands near the coast ("there is no record of any
swamps or marsh in its course") but from the lake that formed at the
river's source "at seasons of snowmelting" in the mountains.
:::

*Morthond*

Similarly the *Morthond* 'Black-root', which rose in a dark valley in
the mountains due south of Edoras, called *Mornan* \['dark valley'\],
not only because of the shadow of the two high mountains between which
it lay, but because through it passed the road from the Gate of the Dead
Men, and living men did not go there.

*Levnui*

There were no other rivers in this region, "further Gondor," until one
came to the *Levnui*, the longest and widest of the Five. This was held
to be the boundary of Gondor in this direction; for beyond it lay the
promontory of Angast and the wilderness of 'Old Púkel-land'
[]{#calibre_link-1917 aria-label="387" role="doc-pagebreak"}(Drúwaith
Iaur) which the Númenóreans had never attempted to occupy with permanent
settlements, though they maintained a Coast-guard force and beacons at
the end of Cape Angast.

*Levnui* is said to mean 'fifth' (after Erui, Sirith, Serni, Morthond),
but its form offers difficulties. (It is spelt *Lefnui* on the Map; and
that is preferable. For though in the Appendices *f* is said to have the
sound of English *f* except when standing at the end of a word,[^661]
voiceless *f* does not in fact occur medially before consonants (in
uncompounded words or names) in Sindarin; while *v* is avoided before
consonants in English).[^662] The difficulty is only apparent.

::: ext
Tolkien then immediately embarks on a long, elaborate, and complex
discussion of the Eldarin numerals. Following this discussion, Tolkien
(continuing westward on the map from Levnui) reintroduced the name
*Adorn*, and repeated the substance of his earlier remarks: "This river,
flowing from the West of Ered Nimrais into the River Isen, is fitted in
style to Sindarin, but has no meaning in that language, and probably is
derived from one of the languages spoken in this region before the
occupation of Gondor by Númenóreans, which began long before the
Downfall." He then continued:
:::

Several other names in Gondor are apparently of similar origin. The
element *Bel-* in *Belfalas* has no suitable meaning in Sindarin.
*Falas* (Q. *falasse*) meant 'shore' -- especially one exposed to great
waves and breakers (cf. Q. *falma* 'a wave-crest, wave'). It is possible
that *Bel* had a similar sense in an alien tongue, and *Bel-falas* is an
example of the type of place-name, not uncommon when a region is
occupied by a new people, in which two elements of much the same
topographical meaning are joined: the first being in the older and the
second in the incoming language.[^663] Probably because the first was
taken by the Incomers as a particular name. However, in Gondor the
shore-land from the mouth of Anduin to Dol Amroth was called *Belfalas*,
but actually usually referred to as *i·Falas* 'the surf-beach' (or
sometimes as *Then-falas* 'short beach', in contrast to *An-falas* 'long
beach', between the mouths of Morthond and Levnui). But the great bay
between Umbar and Angast (the Long Cape, beyond Levnui) was called the
Bay of Belfalas (*Côf Belfalas*) or simply of Bel (*Côf gwaeren Bêl*
'the windy Bay of Bêl'). So that it is more probable that Bêl was the
name or part of the name of the region afterward usually called
*Dor-en-Ernil* 'land of the Prince': it was perhaps the most important
part of Gondor before the Númenórean settlement.

Tolkien writes: "With 'the windy Bay of Bêl' cf. the poem *The Man in
the Moon came down too soon* in *The Adventures of Tom Bombadil* (1962),
where the Man in the Moon fell 'to a foaming bath in the windy Bay of
Bel', identified as Belfalas in the preface to the book. -- This passage
was struck through, presumably at once, since the next paragraph begins
again 'Several other names in Gondor are apparently of similar origin'.
A page of rapid manuscript found with the typescript essay shows my
father sketching an entirely different origin for the element *Bel.* I
have referred to this text and cited it in part in *Unfinished Tales*
(p. 247), observing that it represents an altogether different
conception of the establishment of the Elvish haven (*Edhellond*) north
of Dol Amroth from that given in *Of Dwarves and Men* (XII:313 and 329
n.67), where it is said that it owed its existence to 'seafaring Sindar
from the west havens of Beleriand who fled in three small ships when the
power of Morgoth overwhelmed the Eldar and the Atani'. The manuscript
page obviously belongs to the same very late period as the essay, as is
seen both from the paper on which it is written and from the fact that
the same page carries drafting for the Oath of Cirion in Quenya
(UT:305)." This manuscript page is given here in full:
:::

*Belfalas*. This is a special case. *Bel-* is certainly an element
derived from a pre-Númenórean name; but its source is known, and was in
fact Sindarin. The regions of Gondor had a complex history in the remote
past, so far as their population was concerned, and the Númenóreans
evidently found many layers of mixed peoples, and numerous islands of
isolated folk either clinging to old dwellings, or in mountain-refuges
from invaders.[^664] But there was one small (but important) element in
Gondor of quite exceptional kind: an Eldarin settlement.[^665] Little is
known of its history until shortly before it disappeared; for the
Eldarin Elves, whether Exiled Noldor or long-rooted Sindar, remained in
Beleriand until its desolation in the Great War against Morgoth; and
then if they did not take sail over Sea wandered westward \[*sic*; read
"eastward"\] in Eriador. There, especially near the Hithaeglir (on
either side), they found scattered settlements of the *Nandor*, Telerin
Elves who had in the First Age never completed the journey to the shores
of the Sea; but both sides recognized their kinship as Eldar. There
appears, however, in the beginning of the Second Age, to have been a
group of Sindar who []{#calibre_link-1919 aria-label="389"
role="doc-pagebreak"}went south. They were a remnant, it seems, of the
people of Doriath, who harboured still their grudge against the Noldor
and left the Grey Havens because these and all the ships there were
commanded by Círdan (a Noldo). Having learned the craft of
shipbuilding[^666] they went in the course of years seeking a place for
havens of their own. At last they settled at the mouth of the Morthond.
There was already a primitive harbour there of fisher-folk; but these in
fear of the Eldar fled into the mountains. The land between Morthond and
Serni (the shoreward parts of Dor-en-Ernil)

::: ext
The manuscript page ends mid-sentence, and without reaching an
explanation of the element *Bel-*. Christopher Tolkien writes: "It was
perhaps a purely experimental extension of the history, at once
abandoned; but the assertion that Círdan was a Noldo is very strange.
This runs clean counter to the entire tradition concerning him -- yet it
is essential to the idea sketched in this passage. Possibly it was his
realization of this that led my father to abandon it in mid-sentence."

The typescript resumes with a replacement of the rejected passage on
*Belfalas* (and now avoiding discussion of that problematic name):
:::

Several other names in Gondor are apparently of similar origin.
*Lamedon* has no meaning in Sindarin (if it was Sindarin it would be
referred to \**lambeton-,* \**lambetân-*, but C.E. *lambe-* 'language'
can hardly be concerned). *Arnach* is not Sindarin. It may be connected
with Arnen on the east side of Anduin. Arnach was applied to the valleys
in the south of the mountains and their foothills between Celos and
Erui. There were many rocky outcrops there, but hardly more than in the
higher valleys of Gondor generally. Arnen was a rock outlier of the
Ephel Dúath, round which the Anduin, south of Minas Tirith, made a wide
bend.

Suggestions of the historians of Gondor that *arn-* is an element in
some pre-Númenórean language meaning 'rock' is merely a guess.[^667]
More probable is the view of the author (unknown) of the fragmentarily
preserved *Ondonórë Nómesseron Minaþurië* ('Enquiry into the Place-names
of Gondor'). On internal evidence he lived as far back as the reign of
Meneldil, son of Anárion -- no events later []{#calibre_link-1920
aria-label="390" role="doc-pagebreak"}than that reign are mentioned --
when memories and records of the early days of the settlements now lost
were still available, and the process of naming was still going on. He
points out that Sindarin was not well-known to many of the settlers who
gave the names, mariners, soldiers, and emigrants, though all aspired to
have some knowledge of it. Gondor was certainly occupied from its
beginning by the Faithful, men of the Elf-friend party and their
followers; and these in revolt against the "Adunaic" Kings who forbade
the use of the Elvish tongues gave all new names in the new realm in
Sindarin, or adapted older names to the manner of Sindarin. They also
renewed and encouraged the study of Quenya, in which important
documents, titles, and formulas were composed. But mistakes were likely
to be made.[^668] Once a name had become current it was accepted by the
rulers and organizers. He thinks therefore that *Arnen* originally was
intended to mean 'beside the water', sc. Anduin; but *ar-* in this sense
is Quenya, not Sindarin. Though since in the full name *Emyn Arnen* the
*Emyn* is Sindarin plural of *Amon* 'hill', *Arnen* cannot be a Sindarin
adjective, since an adjective of such shape would have a Sindarin plural
*ernain*, or *ernin*. The name must therefore have meant 'the hills of
Arnen'. It is now forgotten, but it can be seen from old records that
*Arnen* was the older name of the greater part of the region later
called *Ithilien*. This was given to the narrow land between the Anduin
and the Ephel Dúath, primarily to the part between Cair Andros and the
southern end of the bend of Anduin, but vaguely extended north to the
Nindalf and south towards the Poros. For when Elendil took as his
dwelling the North Kingdom, owing to his friendship with the Eldar, and
committed the South Kingdom to his sons, they divided it so, as is said
in ancient annals: "Isildur took as his own land all the region of
Arnen; but Anárion took the land from Erui to Mount Mindolluin and
thence westward to the North Wood" (later in Rohan called the Firien
Wood), "but Gondor south of Ered Nimrais they held in common."

*Arnach*, if the above explanation is accepted, is not then related to
*Arnen*. Its origin and source are in that case now lost. It was
generally called in Gondor *Lossarnach*. *Loss* is Sindarin for 'snow',
especially fallen and long-lying snow. For what reason this was prefixed
to Arnach is unclear. Its upper valleys were renowned for their flowers,
and below them there were great orchards, from which at the time of the
War of the Ring much of the fruit needed in Minas Tirith still came.
Though no mention of this is found in any chronicles -- as is often the
case with matters of common knowledge -- it seems []{#calibre_link-1921
aria-label="391" role="doc-pagebreak"}probable that the reference was in
fact to the fruit blossom. Expeditions to Lossarnach to see the flowers
and trees were frequently made by the people of Minas Tirith. (See index
Lossarnach, Imloth Melui 'sweet flower-valley', a place in Arnach.) This
use of 'snow' would be specially likely in Sindarin, in which the words
for fallen snow and flower were much alike, though different in origin:
*loss* and *loth*, \[the latter\] meaning 'inflorescence, a head of
small flowers'. *Loth* is actually most often used collectively in
Sindarin, equivalent to *goloth*; and a single flower denoted by
*elloth* (*er-loth*) or *lotheg*.

*The names of the Beacon hills*
:::

The full beacon system, that was still operating in the War of the Ring,
can have been no older than the settlement of the Rohirrim in
Calenardhon about 500 years before; for its principal function was to
warn the Rohirrim that Gondor was in danger or (more rarely) the
reverse. How old the names then used were cannot be said. The beacons
were set on hills or on the high ends of ridges running out from the
mountains, but some were not very notable objects.

*Eilenach and Eilenaer*

This entry is given in the same note in *Unfinished Tales*, but in this

*Eilenach* (better spelt *Eilienach*). Probably an alien name; not
Sindarin, Númenórean, or Common Speech. In true Sindarin *eilen* could
only be derived from \**elyen*, \**alyen*, and would normally be written
*eilien*. This and *Eilenaer* (older name of Halifirien: see that below)
are the only names of this group that are certainly pre-Númenórean. They
are evidently related. Both were notable features.

The name and parenthetical note on *Eilenaer* entered here, as

father intended to introduce it, but before he did so he rejected that
account in its entirety, as will be seen." At the end of the description
of Eilenach and Nardol as given in *Unfinished Tales*, where it is said
that the fire on Nardol could be seen from Halifirien, Tolkien added a
note:
:::

The line of beacons from Nardol to Halifirien lay in a shallow curve
bending a little southward, so that the three intervening beacons did
not cut off the view.

::: ext
There follow statements concerning Erelas and Calenhad, elements of
which were used in the index to *Unfinished Tales.*
:::

*Erelas*

*Erelas* was a small beacon, as also was *Calenhad*. These were not
always lit; their lighting as in *The Lord of the Rings* was a signal of
great urgency. *Erelas* is Sindarin in style, but has no suitable
meaning in that language. It was a green hill without trees, so that
neither *er* 'single' nor *las(s)* 'leaf' seem applicable.

*Calenhad*

*Calenhad* was similar but rather larger and higher. *Calen* was the
usual word in Sindarin for 'green' (its older sense was 'bright', Q.
*kalina*). *-had* appears to be for *sad* (with usual mutation in
combinations); if not misspelt this is from SAT 'space, place, sc. a
limited area naturally or artificially defined' (also applied to
recognized periods or divisions of time), 'divide, mark off', seen in S.
*sad* 'a limited area naturally or artificially defined, a place, spot',
etc. (also *sant* 'a garden, field, yard, or other place in private
ownership, whether enclosed or not'). *Calenhad* would thus mean simply
'green space', applied to the flat turf-covered crown of the hill. But
*had* may stand for S. *-hadh* (the maps do not use *dh*, but this is
the only case where *dh* might be involved, except *Caradhras* which is
omitted, and *Enedhwaith* which is misspelt *ened*).[^669] *-hadh* would
then be for *sadh* (in isolated use *sâdh*) 'sward, turf' -- base SAD
'strip, flay, peel off', etc.[^670]

[]{#calibre_link-1923 aria-label="393" role="doc-pagebreak"}*Halifirien*

The essay ends (unfinished) with a long and notable discussion of the
Halifirien; Tolkien's interspersed notes are collected together at the
end of this discussion. With this account cf. UT:300--1, 303--5.

*Halifirien* is a name in the language of Rohan. It was a mountain with
easy approach to its summit. Down its northern slopes grew the great
wood called in Rohan the Firien Wood. This became dense in lower ground,
westward along the Mering Stream and northwards out into the moist plain
through which the Stream flowed into the Entwash. The great West Road
passed through a long ride or clearing through the wood, to avoid the
wet land beyond its eaves. The name Halifirien (modernized in spelling
for *Háligfirgen*) meant Holy Mountain. The older name in Sindarin had
been *Fornarthan* 'North Beacon'; the wood had been called *Eryn Fuir*
'North Wood'. The reason for the Rohan name is not now known for
certain. The mountain was regarded with reverence by the Rohirrim; but
according to their traditions at the time of the War of the Ring that
was because it was on its summit that Eorl the Young met Cirion, Steward
of Gondor; and there when they had looked forth over the land they fixed
the bounds of the realm of Eorl, and Eorl swore to Cirion the Oath of
Eorl -- "the unbroken oath" -- of perpetual friendship and alliance with
Gondor. Since in oaths of the greatest solemnity the names of the Valar
were invoked[^671] [^672] -- and though the oath was called "the Oath of
Eorl" in Rohan it was also called "the Oath of Cirion" (for Gondor was
equally pledged to aid Rohan) and he would use solemn terms in his own
tongue -- this might be sufficient to hallow the spot.

But the account in annals contains two remarkable details: that there
was at the place where Cirion and Eorl stood what appeared to be an
ancient monument of rough stones nearly man-high with a flat top; and
that on this occasion Cirion to the wonder of many invoked the One (that
is God). His exact words are not recorded,[^673] but they probably took
the form of allusive terms such as Faramir used in explaining to Frodo
the content of the unspoken "grace" (before communal meals)[^674] that
was a Númenórean ritual, e.g. "These words shall stand by the faith of
the heirs of the Downfallen in the keeping of the Thrones of the West
and of that which is above all Thrones for ever."

[]{#calibre_link-1924 aria-label="394" role="doc-pagebreak"}This would
in effect hallow the spot for as long as the Númenórean realms endured,
and was no doubt intended to do so, being not in any way an attempt to
*restore* the worship of the One on the Meneltarma ('pillar of heaven'),
the central mountain of Númenor,[^675] but a reminder of it, and of the
claim made by "the heirs of Elendil" that since they had never wavered
in their allegiance they[^676] were still permitted to address the One
in thought and prayer direct.

The "ancient monument" -- by which was evidently meant a structure made
before the coming of the Númenóreans -- is a curious feature, but is no
support to the view that the mountain was already in some sense
"hallowed" before its use in the oath-taking. Had it been regarded as of
"religious" significance it would in fact have made this use impossible,
unless it had at least been completely destroyed first.[^677] [^678] For
a religious structure that was "ancient" could only have been erected by
the Men of Darkness, corrupted by Morgoth or his servant Sauron. The
Middle Men, descendants of the ancestors of the Númenóreans, were not
regarded as evil nor inevitable enemies of Gondor. Nothing is recorded
of their religion or religious practices before they came in contact
with the Númenóreans,[^679] and those who became associated or fused
with the Númenóreans adopted their customs and beliefs (included in the
"lore" which Faramir speaks of as being learned by the Rohirrim). The
"ancient monument" can thus not have been made by the Rohirrim, or
honoured by them as sacred, since they had not yet []{#calibre_link-1925
aria-label="395" role="doc-pagebreak"}established themselves in Rohan at
the time of the Oath (soon after the Battle of the Field of Celebrant),
and such structures in high places as places of religious worship was no
part of the customs of Men, good or evil.[^680] [^681] It may however
have been a tomb.

::: ext
At the words "It may however have been a tomb", Tolkien abandoned this
text, and (no doubt immediately) marked the entire account of the
Halifirien for deletion.

Christopher Tolkien writes: "These last words may well signify the
precise moment at which the tomb of Elendil on Halifirien \[cf. UT:304\]
entered the history; and it is interesting to observe the mode of its
emergence. The original 'Firien' was the 'black hill' in which were the
caverns of Dunharrow (VIII:251); it was also called 'the Halifirien'
(VIII:257, 262), and Dunharrow was 'said to be a *haliern*' (Old English
*hálig-ern* 'holy place, sanctuary') 'and to contain some ancient relic
of old days before the Dark'; while *Dunharrow*, in my father's later
words, is 'a modernisation of Rohan *Dūnhaerg* "the heathen fane on the
hillside", so-called because this refuge of the Rohirrim ... was on the
site of a sacred place of the old inhabitants' (VIII:267 n.35). The name
*Halifirien* was soon transferred to become the last of the beacon-hills
of Gondor, at the western end of the chain (VIII:257), which had been
first named *Mindor Uilas* (VIII:233); but there is no indication at all
of what my father had in mind, with respect to the very express meaning
of the name *Halifirien*, when he made this transference. The account
given above, written so late in his life, seems to be the first
statement on the subject; and here he assumed without question that
(while the hill had earlier borne the Sindarin name *Fornarthan* 'North
Beacon') it was the Rohirrim who called it 'the Holy Mountain': and they
called it so, 'according to their traditions at the time of the War of
the Ring', because of the profound gravity and solemnity of the oath of
Cirion and Eorl taken on its summit, in which the name of Eru was
invoked. He refers to a record in the 'annals' that 'an ancient
[]{#calibre_link-1926 aria-label="396" role="doc-pagebreak"}monument of
rough stones nearly man-high with a flat top' stood on the summit of the
Halifirien -- but he at once proceeds to argue strongly that its
presence can be 'no support to the view that the mountain was in some
sense "hallowed" before its use in the oath-taking', since any such
ancient object of 'religious' significance 'could only have been erected
by the Men of Darkness, corrupted by Morgoth or his servant Sauron.'
But: 'It may however have been a tomb.'

"And thus the 'hallowing' of the hill (anciently named Eilenaer) was
carried back two and a half thousand years before the Rohirrim settled
in Calenardhon: already at the beginning of the Third Age it was the
Hill of Awe, Amon Anwar of the Númenóreans, on account of that tomb on
its summit. I have no doubt that the account of the Oath of Cirion and
Eorl given, with the closely related texts, in *Unfinished Tales*,
followed very shortly and perhaps with no interval at all the
abandonment of this essay on the names of the rivers and beacon-hills of
Gondor.

"It is thus seen that not only the present work but all the history of
the Halifirien and Elendil's tomb arose from Mr. Bibire's brief query.

"This is a convenient place to notice a stage in the development of the
story of Elendil's tomb that was not mentioned in *Unfinished Tales*.
There is a rejected draft page for the passage recounting the definition
of the bounds of Gondor and Rohan by Cirion and Eorl, which scarcely
differs from the text printed in *Unfinished Tales* until the paragraph
beginning: 'By this pact only a small part of the Wood of Anwar ...'
(UT:306). Here the rejected text reads:
:::

By this agreement originally only a small part of the Wood west of the
Mering Stream was included in Rohan; but the Hill of Anwar was declared
by Cirion to be now a hallowed place of both peoples, and any of them
might now ascend to its summit with the leave of the King of the Éothéod
or the Steward of Gondor.

For the following day after the taking of the oaths Cirion and Eorl with
twelve men ascended the Hill again; and Cirion let open the tomb. "It is
fitting now at last," he said, "that the remains of the father of kings
should be brought to safe-keeping in the hallows of Minas Tirith.
Doubtless had he come back from the war his tomb would have been far
away in the North, but Arnor has withered, and Fornost is desolate, and
the heirs of Isildur have gone into the shadows, and no word of them has
come to us for many lives of men."

::: ext
[]{#calibre_link-1927 aria-label="397" role="doc-pagebreak"}"Here my
father stopped, and taking a new page wrote the text as it stands in
*Unfinished Tales*, postponing the opening of the tomb and the removal
of the remains of Elendil to Minas Tirith to a later point in the story

all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in
the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the
story and the symbolism." (L:172)

"Among the exiles, remnants of the Faithful who had not adopted the
false religion nor taken part in the rebellion, religion as divine
worship (though perhaps not as philosophy and metaphysics) seems to have
played a small part ..." (L:194 fn.)

::: ext
As stated in my introduction to part two of this book, Tolkien's claim
that "*The Lord of the Rings* is of course a fundamentally religious and
Catholic work" has puzzled many critics, because both *The Lord of the
Rings* and Tolkien's wider *legendarium* are all but devoid of
references to any religious *cultus* (let alone a *Catholic* system of
rites and worship). And as I suggest, I think this claim puzzles many
critics because they have overlooked what I believe is
[]{#calibre_link-1932 aria-label="402" role="doc-pagebreak"}the most
important word in the claim: sc. *fundamentally*. I take this word quite
literally, and not merely as a throwaway rhetorical intensifier; that
is, I take it that Tolkien is saying that *The Lord of the Rings* and,
by extension, his broader *legendarium* (of which the *LR* is a
deliberate part, and its lengthy coda), is *at its core and foundation*,
or as one might say *in its essential nature*, based on religious, and
specifically Catholic, beliefs and thought. Tolkien says as much in the
third (seldom quoted) passage from *Letters* given above: "a tale, which
is *built on or out of* certain 'religious' ideas" (emphasis added).

As I also stated there, it is my hope that the writings collected in
this volume will support this. For some with knowledge of the Catholic
faith -- which in addition to a set of dogmas and religious rites
entails a worldview encompassing *inter alia* a distinctive theology,
metaphysics, cosmogony, and anthropology -- many of the Catholic
elements and themes highlighted and briefly explored here will have
already been noted. But these will be opaque to many readers, and so I
provide this concise guide for those readers who wish to know to what I
believe Tolkien is apparently alluding or referring at various points
that may otherwise only perplex or seem thoroughly abstruse.

A[GES OF THE]{.small} W[ORLD]{.small}

[Here](#calibre_link-839): "we being in 1960 of the 7^th^ Age ..."

While many are familiar with the concept of named Ages of the World as
found in classical mythology, e.g. the Golden Age, the Silver Age, etc.,
it is far less well known that the Catholic Church has long espoused a
system of *numbered* Ages of the World, extending through at least a
Sixth Age. Throughout Tolkien's life the Proclamation of the Birth of
Christ, just before the start of the Christmas Vigil Mass, flatly stated
that Christ was born "in the sixth age of the world". The text of the
proclamation comes from the *Martyrologium Romanum* (Roman Martyrology),
the Roman Rite Catholic Church's official list of martyrs and saints,
with associated calendrical information. It reads in part (emphasis

::: ext
Since the Enlightenment, and particularly stemming from the hugely
influential theory of mind-body dualism espoused by seventeenth-century
century philosopher, mathematician, and scientist René Descartes, it has
become commonplace, even among many Christians, to regard the human
person as a spirit (soul) that *inhabits* and *uses* a body, which
however is of no particular importance to the nature or integrity of the
human person. In this view, a human person is in no essential way
incomplete when a soul leaves their body; in fact, for many the
departure of a soul is actually regarded as liberating, as it frees the
human person from material needs and burdens.

Though most who have adopted this view (in considered fashion or not)
will be unaware of it, this dualist anthropology is in fact a
[]{#calibre_link-1934 aria-label="404" role="doc-pagebreak"}revival of
the ancient Platonic/Gnostic/Manichaean belief in the superiority of the
spiritual to the material; and in their extremes, the belief that the
material world, including the body, is inherently evil, a trap for the
human soul, whose primary goal is, or ought to be, to free itself from
the body and the material world.

In Catholic anthropology, on the other hand, the nature of the human
person, and the relation of body and spirit in the human person, is
precisely that which Tolkien ascribes to Incarnates, here and elsewhere,
repeatedly and forcefully. That is, it is the nature of incarnate
persons, both Elves and Men, to be a unity of body and spirit, such that
if either is lost or separated, the incarnate person is incomplete, and
has suffered a grievous loss and disruption to its nature. Neither the
body nor the material world are inherently inferior to spirit, or
something that a spirit has a duty to seek to escape.
:::

[Here](#calibre_link-111): "by the birth of Lúthien \[Melian\] became
enmeshed in 'incarnation', unable to lay it aside while husband and
child remained in Arda alive, and her powers of mind (especially
foresight) became clouded by the body through which it must now always
work."

[Here](#calibre_link-843): "Pengolodh also cites the opinion that if a
'spirit' (that is, one of those not embodied by creation) uses a *hröa*
for the furtherance of its personal purposes, or (still more) for the
enjoyment of bodily faculties, it finds it increasingly difficult to
operate without the *hröa*. The things that are most binding are those
that in the Incarnate have to do with the life of the *hröa* itself, its
sustenance and its propagation. Thus eating and drinking are binding,
but not the delight in beauty of sound or form. Most binding is
begetting or conceiving."

::: ext
In marked contrast with that of Incarnates, the situation with spirits
like the Valar and Maiar that are not incarnate by nature, but instead
fashion bodies for themselves in order to more easily interact with
Incarnates and the material world, turns out in one important aspect to
be Platonic, as shown by this passage in Plato's *Phaedo* (*Plato:
Complete Works*, Hackett, 1997, [here](#calibre_link-844)):
:::

"The soul of the true philosopher thinks that this deliverance \[from
the body and the senses\] must not be opposed and so keeps away from
pleasures and desires and pains as far as he can; he reflects that
violent pleasure or pain or passion does not cause merely such evils as
one might expect, such as one suffers when one has been sick or
extravagant through desire, []{#calibre_link-1935 aria-label="405"
role="doc-pagebreak"}but the greatest and most extreme evil, though one
does not reflect on this.

What is that, Socrates? asked Cebes.

That the soul of every man, when it feels violent pleasure or pain in
connection with some object, inevitably believes at the same time that
what causes such feelings must be very clear and very true, which it is
not. Such objects are mostly visible, are they not?

Certainly.

And doesn't such an experience tie the soul to the body most completely?

How so?

Because every pleasure or pain provides, as it were, another nail to
rivet the soul to the body and to weld them together. It makes the soul
corporeal ... As it shares the beliefs and delights of the body, I think
it inevitably comes to share its ways and manner of life ..."

E[XISTENCE,]{.small} C[ONTINGENCY OF]{.small}

[Here](#calibre_link-845): "He \[Eru\] is outside Eä but holds the whole
of Eä in thought (by which it coheres)."

::: ext
In Catholic metaphysics, the existence of the material universe and all
that is in it, is *contingent*: both in the sense that it does not exist
by necessity but rather by a gratuitous act of Divine creation, and in
the sense that its continued existence, in all its parts down to the
most minute particle, and at all moments, is due to God's continuous
(from a temporal view) willing of its existence. Its Catholic
formulation (as so much else of Catholic metaphysics) is due to St.
Thomas Aquinas, who greatly elaborated and expanded upon the contingency
of existence.

Tolkien's particular statement here, that the whole of material and
temporal existence (Eä, "the World that Is") "coheres" (\< Latin
*co-haerere*, literally 'stick together') in Eru's thought, also clearly
echoes Scripture, in particular Col. 1:17: "He \[Christ\] is before all
things, and in Him all things hold together". The ongoing contingency of
existence is also reflected in Acts 17:28, where St. Paul, quoting
(ultimately) Epimenides (who however had Zeus in mind), says to the
gathered Athenians: "For 'In him we live and move and have our being,'
as even some of your poets have said".
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1936 aria-label="406"
role="doc-pagebreak"}E[VIL]{.small} ([AS]{.small} L[ACK OF]{.small}
P[ERFECTION]{.small})

[Here](#calibre_link-36): "*√man* 'good'. This implies that a
person/thing is (relatively or absolutely) 'unmarred': that is in Elvish
thought unaffected by the disorders introduced into Arda by Morgoth: and
therefore is true to its nature and function."

[Here](#calibre_link-846): "'Best', but not perfectly: that is, not in
any case exactly according to the conceived and unrealized pattern. But
such 'imperfection' is not an evil, necessarily."

::: ext
Aquinas, like Augustine and Plato before him, held that evil has no
independent existence. Certainly, rational beings can *do* evil things,
but evil itself has no "being". Rather, in much the same way that dark
has no independent existence, but is rather merely a lack or absence of
light, evil for Aquinas is likewise some deficiency or lack of the good
in/for created things. In Thomistic terms, this is held to mean a lack
in a thing's *perfection of form*: that is, a failure or prevention of a
thing to fully be or become that which by its nature it ought to be, in
all its essentials. Hence it is in this sense evil if, say, a squirrel,
which has the *form* (in Tolkien's parlance, *pattern*) of a quadrupedal
tree-dwelling rodent with a bushy tail that typically feeds on nuts and
seeds, either lacks or is deprived of one or more limbs: it does not
fully realize, or no longer fully realizes, its form. This of course
does not mean that such a squirrel is itself *evil*, only that it has
suffered an evil (in this Thomistic sense). Obviously, too, there are
degrees of such evil: if, losing one or more limbs, a squirrel is no
longer able to dwell in trees or even obtain food for itself, then it
suffers more of an evil than if, say, it lacked/lost part of its tail.

Even so, the Elvish definition of good, and of impairments to the good,
hinges on the degree to which a thing or being realizes, or fails or is
impeded from realizing, its particular *pattern*; that is, on the degree
to which a thing or being is "unmarred". The unmarred state of Arda and
its beings was perfectly "true to its nature and function"; but this
perfection of all things was impaired by Morgoth, so that every thing in
Arda has been subjected to an evil, and every being in Arda is in turn
susceptible to an inclination to do evil.
:::

E[VOLUTION]{.small} (T[HEISTIC]{.small})

[Here](#calibre_link-847): "This the Valar say is how the variety of
Arda was indeed achieved: beginning with a few patterns, and varying
these or blending pattern with pattern."

[]{#calibre_link-1937 aria-label="407"
role="doc-pagebreak"}[Here](#calibre_link-848): "For it is clear in such
lore as we have received from the Valar that they set in motion the
unfolding of different living patterns at many different points in the
*Ainulindalë,* and therefore this was repeated in Eä. Within Eä we have
then not one single *Ermenië* or Great Pattern, but a number of early or
Major Patterns (*Arkantiër*)."

[Here](#calibre_link-848): "... these 'major patterns' (*arkantiër*)
developing in Arda will diverge whether by the design of their
beginners, or by the varieties caused by the stuff of Arda which they
must use, into different but similar groups of descendants."

::: ext
A long-standing feature of what has come to be known as "young-Earth
creationism" is the belief in "special creation": that is, that the
first living things in all their species were created, if not "at once",
nonetheless within a short period of time. This belief was (is) rooted
in a literal interpretation of the creation account of Genesis, such
that all varieties of life were created within a span of four days.
Coupled with commitment to a theory of invariable, immutable forms (see
H[YLOMORPHISM]{.small} below), there is no time or mechanism available
for any sort of descent of species: all species must therefore have been
directly created by God at the beginning of the world.

Tolkien's theory of *patterns* (forms) here, on the other hand, allows
both for beginnings at different times of various species, from a
variety of patterns (though always subordinate to and ultimately derived
from Eru's own Great Pattern, and subject to the will of Eru), and even
for their change, by blending or divergence, over time. (A time greatly
lengthened by the alteration of the length of the Valian Year, though of
course still nothing like geologic time.) It should be noted that this
sort of theistic evolution is *not* the same as what is now commonly
called "Intelligent Design", one form at least of which has God
repeatedly intervening in time to shape and guide the development of
species. Rather, the ability of patterns to blend and diverge over time
is in a sense "built into" them. (Note that the term *evolve* itself, in
origin and in this context, indicates a "rolling out" of some inherent
potentiality already possessed by a living being, or in Tolkien's
terminology, that "unfolds" over time.)
:::

F[ALL OF]{.small} M[AN,]{.small} T[HE]{.small}

[Here](#calibre_link-849): "The Eldar thought that some disaster,
perhaps even amounting to a 'change of the world' (sc. something that
affected all []{#calibre_link-1938 aria-label="408"
role="doc-pagebreak"}its later history), had befallen Men which altered
their nature, especially with regard to 'death' ... Andreth believed
that death (and especially the fear of it) had come upon Men as a
punishment or result of some disaster -- rebellion against Eru the Eldar
guessed."

::: ext
In the Catholic view, the Fall of Man occurred when our "first parents",
who are called Adam and Eve in the book of Genesis, transgressed against
God's command that they not eat of the fruit of the Tree of the
Knowledge of Good and Evil. Having done so at the instigation of Satan
in the form of a serpent, they separated themselves from God's grace,
and were expelled from the earthly paradise of the Garden of Eden. And
because they were the first parents of all mankind, the consequence of
their sin, called "original sin", was passed on to their children and so
to all subsequent generations of the human race. It is for this reason
that all of mankind is subject to toil, hardship, evil desires, and (at
least bodily) death.
:::

[Here](#calibre_link-850): "The Quendi never 'fell' as a race -- not in
the sense in which they and Men themselves believed that the Second
Children had 'fallen'. Being 'tainted' with the Marring (which affected
all the 'flesh of Arda' from which their *hröar* were derived and were
nourished), and having also come under the Shadow of Melkor before their
Finding and rescue, they could *individually* do wrong. But they *never*
(not even the wrong-doers) rejected Eru, nor worshipped either Melkor or
Sauron as a god -- neither individually or as a whole people. Their
lives, therefore, came under no general curse or diminishment; and their
primeval and natural life-span, as a race, by 'doom' co-extensive with
the remainder of the Life of Arda, remained unchanged in all their
varieties."

::: ext
Unlike Men, Elves did not fall corporately. They are thus in many ways a
portrait of what Tolkien imagined unfallen Men could have been.
:::

[Here](#calibre_link-851): "childbirth is not among the Eldar
accompanied by pain"

::: ext
Genesis 3:16 states that painful childbirth is one of the consequences
of the Fall: "in pain you shall bring forth children". The Eldar, being
unfallen, do not experience pain in childbirth. Moreover, since the
Catholic Church teaches that the Virgin Mary was, as Tolkien says "the
only *unfallen* \[purely human\] person" (L:286 fn.),
[]{#calibre_link-1939 aria-label="409" role="doc-pagebreak"}i.e.,
preserved from original sin by an act of Christ's prevenient grace (the
actual meaning of the Immaculate Conception), it likewise teaches that
she did not experience pain during Jesus' birth.
:::

[Here](#calibre_link-852): "The Númenóreans, or Dúnedain, were still in
our terms 'fallen Men'; but they were descendants of ancestors who were
in general wholly repentant, detesting all the corruptions of the
'Shadow'; and they were specially graced. In general they had little
inclination to, and a conscious detestation of lust, greed, hate and
cruelty, and tyranny."

::: ext
Again, the early Númenóreans, though being fallen, by a special grace
generally approach nearest to the unfallen Quendi, particularly in their
right relations to God, to incarnate existence and self-mastery, to the
natural world, and in their interests and arts.
:::

H[YLOMORPHISM]{.small}

[Here](#calibre_link-593): "In the first shapings this primary substance
or *erma* became varied and divided into many secondary materials or
*nassi*, which have within themselves various patterns, whereby they
differ one from another inwardly, and outwardly have different virtues
and effects."

::: ext
The Aristotelean-Thomistic metaphysic of *hylomorphism* (from Greek ὕλη,
*hylē*, 'wood, matter', and μορφή, *morphē*, 'form'), holds that all
material things (including human beings and all other things, living and
unliving) are comprised of *matter* (ultimately derived from
P[RIME]{.small} M[ATTER]{.small}, q.v. below) and *form*, that is, a
Divinely-willed organizing principle that shapes prime matter into the
thing that it is. In a living being, its *form* is its *spirit*; in a
human being (any Child of Eru) its *form* is its soul. In Tolkien's
terms, living beings comprise *erma* 'prime substance' and an ultimately
Divinely-willed *arkantië* 'great pattern'. A Tolkienian distinctive is
that the *arkantiër* were developed in response to the Great Pattern,
*Erkantië*, of Eru, and so represented a subcreative act; and yet were
both permitted and willed by Eru. Another distinctive is that the nature
of Incarnates consists of an unity of both body (in Tolkien's terms a
*hröa*) and, as its pattern, a soul (in Tolkien's terms, a *fëa*).
:::

I[NCORRUPTIBILITY OF]{.small} S[AINTS]{.small}

[]{#calibre_link-1940 aria-label="410"
role="doc-pagebreak"}[Here](#calibre_link-624): "Men report that the
bodies of some of their Dead long maintain their coherence, and even
sometimes endure in fair form as if they slept only. That this is true
the Elves know by proof; but the purpose or reason is not to them clear.
Men say that it is the bodies of the holy that sometimes remain long
incorrupt: meaning those of whom the *fëar* were strong and yet were
turned ever towards Eru in love and hope."

::: ext
The Catholic Church recognizes as *incorruptible* a body that, without
having been embalmed or otherwise artificially preserved, nonetheless
shows little or no sign of decomposition even long after death.
Incorruptibility is most often associated with saints, and among the
laity at least incorruptibility is considered evidence that the deceased
is a saint, whether (yet) canonized or not. Some incorruptible bodies
are further said to exude the O[DOUR OF]{.small} S[ANCTITY]{.small}
(q.v.).
:::

M[ARRIAGE]{.small}

[Here](#calibre_link-109).: "The 'desire' for marriage and bodily union
was represented by *√yer*; but this never in the uncorrupted occurred
without 'love' *√mel*, nor without the desire for children."

[Here](#calibre_link-853): "Elves married in *perpetuity* and as long as
a first mate was alive and incarnate they had no thought of other
marriage. In Aman the only case of a breach was Míriel/Finwë ... If a
wife was left widowed (or vice versa) forever remarriage was
permissible, but seldom occurred."

::: ext
Two distinctives of the Catholic view of sex and marriage are 1) that
sex has two natural and inseparable ends, sc. spousal unity and
procreation; and 2) that marriage is permanent while both spouses are
alive, and so indissoluble save by and at the death of one or the other
of the spouses. (It is this latter fact that presented Tolkien with a
conundrum when considering the case of Finwë and Míriel, as well as when
considering the phenomenon of Elvish reincarnation.)
:::

[Here](#calibre_link-854): "Marriage was regarded \[by Númenóreans\] as
natural for all, and once entered into was permanent."

::: ext
[]{#calibre_link-1941 aria-label="411" role="doc-pagebreak"}As
highlighted above (T[HE]{.small} F[ALL OF]{.small} M[AN]{.small}), while
the Númenóreans were nonetheless fallen, like all mankind, they were
(initially, and for long) granted a special grace to return to a state
nearer to that of unfallen Man (and thus nearer to that of the Eldar).
This state is exemplified not only in their increased lifespan, but in
their moral character, including their attitudes and behaviours
concerning marriage, which in these matters is the same as that of the
(corporately) unfallen Eldar.
:::

O[DOUR OF]{.small} S[ANCTITY]{.small}

[Here](#calibre_link-855): "the Maiar were usually invisible unclad, but
their presence was revealed by their fragrance ... This applied only to
those uncorrupted."

::: ext
Writing in the fourth century, St. Cyril of Jerusalem taught: "In each
person, Scripture says, the Spirit reveals his presence in a particular
way for the common good. The \[Holy\] Spirit comes gently and makes
himself known by his fragrance." (Catechetical Lecture 16, *De Spiritu
Sancto*)

The bodies of holy people are also reported to emit a fragrance, often
compared to flowers, known as the *odor sanctitatis*, 'odour of
sanctity', while alive and, more often, at and after the moment of
death. The incorruptible bodies of saints have also been reported to
emit the *odor sanctitatis* even long after their death.
:::

P[RIME]{.small} M[ATTER]{.small}

[Here](#calibre_link-593): "Some of the loremasters hold that the
substance of Arda (or indeed of all Eä) was in the beginning one thing,
the *erma* \['prime substance'\]".

[Here](#calibre_link-856): "the matters of Eä proceed from a single
*erma*"

[Here](#calibre_link-857): "Arda began with the *Erma* \['prime
substance'\] and then the *nassi* \['materials'\], before the entry of
the living things"

[Here](#calibre_link-57): "\[The Valar\] had assisted in the general
design of Eä, and severally, in different degrees and modes, in the
production from the *erma* (or prime substance) of things of many kinds
... Neither they nor the Incarnate could make things utterly new; they
could not "create" after the manner of Eru, but could only make things
out of what already existed, the *erma*, or its later variations and
combinations."

::: ext
[]{#calibre_link-1942 aria-label="412" role="doc-pagebreak"}In
Aristotelean-Thomistic metaphysics, "prime matter" (*prima* *materia*)
is the fundamental, created, but undifferentiated matter from which all
material things are made, through the agency of ultimately
Divinely-willed forms, that organize and shape a portion of prime matter
into the thing that it is. In Tolkienian terms, it is the *erma* 'prime
substance', from which all *nassi* 'materials' derive, by the agency of
*kantiër* 'patterns' that derive mediately from the Valar, but
ultimately from Eru.

### PART ONE: TIME AND AGEING {#part-one-time-and-ageing .a-head-space-after}

### II Valinorian Time-Divisions {#ii-valinorian-time-divisions .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** But since the light of Valinor was quite independent of
earth-rotation, and depended on the length of the light of the Trees --
which from the opening of Telperion to the closing of Laurelin occupied
1 Day or Sun-year exactly -- all smaller fractions of time were reckoned
in descending twelfths. These were, of course, exact and accurate for
Valinorian purposes, but owing to the inexactitude of the Sun-year in
relation to earth-rotations, were complicated if stated in relation to
Middle-earth times (in days, hours, seconds).

### III Of Time in Arda {#iii-of-time-in-arda .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Or as the Eldar said "met love". In this matter the Elven
tongues make distinctions. To speak of Quenya: "love", which Men might
rather call "friendship" or even "liking" (but for the greater warmth,
strength, and permanency with which it was felt by the Quendi) was
represented by words derived from √*mel*. *Emel* (or *melmë*, a
particular case) was primarily a motion or inclination of the *fëa*, and
therefore could occur between those of the same or of difference sexes.
In itself it included no sexual (or rather procreative) desire; though
naturally in Incarnates a difference of sex altered the emotion, since
sex is held by the Eldar to belong also to the *fëa*, and not solely to
the *hröa*, and is not therefore wholly included in procreation. Sexual
desire (for marriage and procreation) was represented by the term
*yermë*; but since this did not occur normally without *melmë* on both
sides the relations of lovers before marriage, or of husbands and wives,
were often described also by *melmë*.

Two other groups of words also referred to feelings that we should often
call "love": those related to √*ndil* and to √*ndur*. √*ndil* may be
compared with the Greek element *phil*, occurring in such words as
*Anglophile* and *bibliophile*, or in such as *philosophy*. It expressed
a deep concern for or interest in things or objects of thought, rather
than in individuals or persons, and so was equivalent to the arts and
sciences of Men, though it surpassed them in intensity and in the
element of affection. Thus *eärendil* 'a lover of the sea', or
*ornendil* 'a lover of trees'. It was often found in names, such as
*Elendil* (\< *eledndil*) 'Ælfwine, lover of the Elves', *Valandil*
'Oswine, lover of the Valar'. √*ndil* (*nilmë*) may be called "love",
because while its mainspring was a concern for things other than self
for their own sakes, it included a personal satisfaction in that the
inclination was part of the "lover's" native character, and study or
service of the things loved were necessary to their fulfilment.

### IV Time-scales {#iv-time-scales .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Elf-men 24, women c. 18.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-863)

**fn2** In this matter the Elven-tongues make distinctions. To speak of
Quenya: *Love*, which Men might call "friendship" (but for the greater
strength and warmth and permanency with which it was felt by the Quendi)
was represented by √*mel*. This was primarily a motion or inclination of
the *fëa*, and therefore could occur between persons of the same sex or
different sexes. It included no sexual or *procreative* desire, though
naturally in Incarnates the difference of sex altered the emotion, since
"sex" is held by the Eldar to belong also to the *fëa* and not solely to
the *hröa*, and is therefore not wholly included in procreation. Such
persons were often called *melotorni* 'love-brothers' and *meletheldi*
'love-sisters'.

The 'desire' for marriage and bodily union was represented by √*yer*;
but this never in the uncorrupted occurred without 'love' √*mel*, nor
without the desire for children. This element was therefore seldom used
except to describe occasions of its dominance in the process of courting
and marriage. The feelings of lovers desiring marriage, and of husband
and wife, were usually described by √*mel*. This 'love' remained, of
course, permanent after the satisfaction of √*yer* in the "Time of the
Children"; but was strengthened by this satisfaction and the memory of
it to a normally unbreakable bond (of feeling, not here to speak of
"law").

Two other stems were also concerned with feelings that we should often
call 'love': √*ndil* and √*ndur*. These generally did not concern
individuals or persons, and were unconnected with *sex* (in either *fëa*
or *hröa*).

√*ndil* is best compared with English *--phile*, in *Anglophile*,
*bibliophile*, etc., or especially with *phil(o)* as in *philosophy* or
*philology*. It expressed a feeling of special concern with, care for,
or interest in things (such as metals), or lower creatures (as birds or
trees), or processes of thought and enquiry (as history), or arts (as
poetry), or in groups of persons (as Elves or Dwarves). Thus *Eledndil*
\> *Elendil* 'lover of the Eldar' or *Elen-ndil* 'of the Stars';
*Eärendil* 'lover of the Sea', *Valandil* 'lover of the Valar'. It may
be called 'love' because while its mainspring was a concern with things
other than self for their own sakes, it included a personal satisfaction
in that the inclination was part of the "lover's" inherent character,
and study or service of the things loved were necessary to his or her
fulfilment.

√*ndur* seems originally to have referred to devotions and interests of
a less personal kind: to fidelity and devotion in service, produced by
circumstances rather than inherent character. Thus an *ornendil* was one
who 'loved' trees, and who (in addition no doubt to studying to
"understand" them) took an especial delight in them; but an *ornendur*
was a tree-keep, a forester, a 'woodsman', a man concerned with trees as
we might say "professionally". But since (certainly among the free
Eldar) √*ndur* was normally accompanied by √*ndil* or personal interest
(and even by √*mel*, for the Eldar held that this emotion can rightly be
felt by Incarnates for other than persons, since they are "akin" to all
things in Arda, through their *hröar* and through the interest of their
*fëar*, each in its own *hröa* and so in all substances of Arda) the
distinction between *--ndil* and *--ndur* (especially in later Quenya
names as used by Elves or Men) became obscured. In ordinary words the
distinction was roughly that between "amateur" and "professional" --
though not including any question of remuneration.

**fn3** Their "youth" the Quendi call that part of their life-time in
which the body is still dominant.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-865)

**fn4** That is, a divine spirit, coëval with the great Valar, but of
less power and authority than the Valar, whom they served. Melian
assumed (as the Valar and Maiar could) "the raiment of the Children",
the Incarnates, out of love for them. Only one of the greatest of the
Eldar in their early vigour could have supported a union of that sort
(unique in all known tales). But Melian, having in woman-form borne a
child after the manner of the Incarnate, desired to do this no more: by
the birth of Lúthien she became enmeshed in "incarnation", unable to lay
it aside while husband and child remained in Arda alive, and her powers
of mind (especially foresight) became clouded by the body through which
it must now always work. To have borne more children would still further
have chained her and trammeled her. In the event, her daughter became
mortal and eventually died, and her husband was slain; and she then cast
off her "raiment" and left Middle-earth.

**fn5** Especially in the "Youth-time" before the Great March.

**fn6** Actually, a length of time = Mortal 96 months or 8 years.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-868)

**fn7** But not on a wholly different time-scale. Thus to a Man Elves
appear to speak rapidly but clearly (unless they retard their speech for
Men's sake), to move quickly and featly (unless they are in urgency, or
much moved, when the movement of their hands, for example, may become
too swift for human eyes to follow closely), and only their thought,
perception, and reasoning seem normally beyond human speed.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-869)

**fn8** But in Middle-earth where Men and Elves met, the rate was
already quickened to 100 = 1. Therefore, here we should have 25 or 33.

### VI The Awaking of the Quendi {#vi-the-awaking-of-the-quendi .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Though it is possible that in the remote past some Quendi had
been daunted or corrupted by Melkor! If so, they left the Quendian
community. The Eldar certainly never, even individually, rejected Eru in
word, or belief.

**fn2** Morgoth's flight could be made to precede the Exile by a longer
period, but this is not necessary if Angband already existed.

**fn3** *But see later*. Men were probably corrupted by Sauron after the
Captivity (100 VYs later).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-876)

**fn4** Or at best 454 years! But Morgoth's flight could take place
*some time before* Exile. The Slaying of the Trees could take place in
VY 1494, the Exile in 1495, and the arrival in Beleriand in 1496.

**fn2** It is said that many remained here for thousands of years but
others migrated -- some eventually going south down the Anduin and
settling on the shores south of the White Mountains, especially in later
Belfalas. Others went on along the coasts until a number, and Denethor,
came up into southeast Beleriand.

**fn1** The Eldarin words referred to are *Min*, *Atta* (or *Tata*),
*Nel-de*. The reverse is probably historical. The *Three* had no names
until they had developed language, and were given (or took) names after
they had devised numerals (or at least the first 12).

for she was a princess of the Ñoldor, who had lived in Aman itself.
Eressëa seemed only a "second best".

**fn2** It is thus possible that 241 is an error not for 341, but for
421: an even more likely error to have occurred, except that the next
following entry is for 420. In that case about 2.8 \[life-\]years would
have intervened between the births, which is even more probable.

### XII Concerning the Quendi in their Mode of Life and Growth {#xii-concerning-the-quendi-in-their-mode-of-life-and-growth .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Though they were, from their Awaking, also immediately concerned
with linguistic expression -- at first in especial of their delight and
joy in Arda, and of their love for their spouses.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-887)

**fn2** This rate of "change" is not concerned at all with the
*perception of Time*. The Quendi did not live or perceive or act slowly.
On the contrary they perceived more swiftly and minutely, and acted more
quickly than Men.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-888)

**fn3** This rate was in some individuals rather slower and might take
up to 21 *olmendi*, or 252 *löar*. Concerning this difference between
men and women the Eldar speak in the legend of the Awaking, which they
call the *Cuivienyarna*, q.v. \[see chap. VIII, "Eldarin Traditions
Concerning the 'Awakening'", above\].

[Back to text](#calibre_link-889)

**fn4** I.e., 24 *olmendi* + 24 *coimendi*.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-890)

**fn5** I.e., 18 *olmendi* + 18 *coimendi*.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-891)

**fn6** This is, after 36 *coimendi* for Elf-men, 42 for Elf-women.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-892)

**fn7** It sometimes happened that a lover failing to find a response in
the "desired spouse" would remain unwed, and later, maybe long after,
would fall in love again, and wed much later than usual.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-893)

**fn8** During this time Elf-women went usually into "retirement" and
went abroad little.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-894)

**fn9** And of course, since Aman was limited, some things must pass
away, while a perennial balance of the whole was maintained. But this
was not confused with "Death".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-895)

**fn10** That is, it is not certain that they could alter the
"constitution" of any creature housing a *fëa*, and having its own
independent centre of being, one of the same *status* and relation to
Eru as their own being, even if of less might.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-896)

### XIV Calculation of the Increase of the Quendi {#xiv-calculation-of-the-increase-of-the-quendi .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Reckoned from the first begetting to the last birth: that is, 6
periods of gestation (9 years) + 5 intervals of an average of 36 years
each (times increase: 12/24/36/48/60): 6 × 9 (= 54) + 5 ×36 (= 180) =
234 years = VY 1/90.

### XVIII Elvish Ages & Númenórean {#xviii-elvish-ages-númenórean .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Puberty and full growth coincided (usually). It did not occur
earlier, but might be delayed as late as 36 GY.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-903)

**fn2** There was no marked difference in sex, except that male puberty
might be later.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-904)

**fn3** And men; Elves claimed that both parents gave up or used more
"vigour" in begetting and conception than mortals do. For each birth a
male was reckoned to give up 1 life-year, and women 2 or more.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-905)

**fn4** All these are periods of change in physical life and efficiency.
They have nothing to do with *rapidity of events*. Thus the "resting
time" of 6 years is only ¹⁄₂₄ of an Elvish life-year or about a
fortnight!! But it is as effective as a 6-year rest. An Elf did not have
to wait 144 years (say) before begetting a second child. Elves spent
their lives with *more* deeds and thoughts than men, not less.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-906)

**fn5** It probably was not; it was very likely longer. In that case
Celeborn must have been a descendant (not son) of Elmo and born in
Beleriand.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-907)

**fn6** At least (thus = 33--34 \[life-years\]).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-908)

**fn7** The only way to make Celebrían effectively younger (e.g. 40 =
mortal equivalent 30) would be to shift the wedding of Celeborn and
Galadriel or arrange for later birth of Celebrían, but to reduce her to
40 would mean postponing the birth 8 × 144 = 1,152 years.

the Eldar were ever "reborn" is a fancy of Men. The relation of *fëa*
and *hröa* made this impossible. The *fëa* was a gift of Eru and fitted
from the beginning and *forever* to its particular body.

Imperishable: Tolkien, St. Thomas, and the Metaphysics of Faërie*

### III Eldarin Hands, Fingers, and Numerals {#iii-eldarin-hands-fingers-and-numerals .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Shoulder-high or higher. The raising added emphasis.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-914)

**fn2** So that a hand was never held up in this way in greeting or
welcome. In such a case the hand would be raised with palm backwards,
and for emphasis with waving of the fingers towards the signaller. In
casual greeting in passing, when no further speech was desired, the hand
was held edge forward, with or without movement of the fingers.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-915)

**fn3** Necessarily from their point of view, since the Eldar made no
distinction between the hands and their operations: see further below on
Left and Right. The gesture of Halbarad was with the right hand.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-916)

**fn4** A "nursery" or instructional substitution for the older word
Gmc. *tehs-*, *tehswa-* (I.E. *deks-* as in Latin *dexter*), which was
preserved only in Gothic and OHG, except precariously in place names
such as the island *Texel*: in which the meaning may have been 'south'.
This use of 'right' as south is found in Sanskrit, and is usual in
Keltic; but is secondary and due to reckoning the compass points from a
position facing East (the rising sun). The I.E. *deks-* stem was
probably in fact connected with the stem *dek-* 'right, proper, good,
fitting', familiar in English borrowings from Latin: *decent*,
*decorous*, etc.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-917)

**fn5** But writing was a special case. For economy and clarity it was
desirable that each letter should have a standard form. Fëanor had
devised his *tengwar* with shapes more convenient to the right hand, and
these were regarded as the "correct" forms; consequently the *tengwar*
were normally written from the left with the right hand, especially in
books and public documents. If written with the left (as often in
letters or private records) the *tengwar* were reversed, and were
correct in a mirror. In the "runes", of later and more elaborate forms
and arrangement, reversal was made significant, and there was no
difference in convenience for either hand. They were written (or cut) in
either direction, or alternating.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-918)

**fn6** Much later, but before the end of the Common Eldarin period, the
Eldar, leaving behind the primitive beginnings with the hand, devised a
counting in sixes and twelves which they used in all more elaborate
reckonings; but in daily and colloquial use many of the decimal terms
remained in use.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-919)

**fn7** *nette* meant 'girl approaching the adult' (in her "teens": the
growth of Elvish children after birth was little if at all slower than
that of the children of Men). The Common Eldarin stem *(wen-ed) wendē*
'maiden' applied to all stages up to the fully adult (until marriage).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-920)

**fn8** The actually recorded *names* of *thumb* and *index-finger*
have, however, no connexion with the numerals for *one*, *two*.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-921)

**fn9** Such a connexion is seen in the case of 3 and 8; while 5 is
certainly related to the words for 'finger'.

**fn10** Reputed to be the greatest of the *Lambeñgolmor* (linguistic
loremasters) before the end of the Elder Days, both by talent and
opportunity, since he himself had known Quenya (Vanyarin and Noldorin)
and Telerin and preserved in a memory remarkable even among the Eldar
the works (especially on etymology) of the earlier loremasters
(including Fëanor); but also had as an Exile been able to learn Sindarin
in its varieties, and Nandorin, and had some acquaintance with Khuzdûl
in its archaic form as used in the habitations of the Dwarves in Ered
Lindon.

### V Beards {#v-beards .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** When I came to think of it, in my own imagination, beards were
not found among Hobbits (as stated in text); nor among the Eldar (not
stated). All *male Dwarves* had them. The wizards had them, though
Radagast (not stated) had only short, curling, light brown hair on his
chin. Men normally had them when full-grown, hence Eomer, Theoden and
all others named. But not Denethor, Boromir, Faramir, Aragorn, Isildur,
or other Númenórean chieftains.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-925)

**fn2** Who had the law been changed in her time would have become
queen, and Elendil would probably have been King of Númenor.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-926)

**fn3** Notably *Húrin* is not one of these names, but being in origin
the name of the most renowned in legend of the House of Hador (from whom
on the male side the Kings were descended) it was reckoned of equal
worth. Why after Mardil Voronwë the Quenya names were abandoned is not
clear; but it was probably simply a part of the ritual "humility" of the
Ruling Stewards, like their never sitting on the throne, having no crown
or sceptre, and banner without device, and holding office only "*in the
name of the King* until he shall return". I say "ritual", because it was
impossible that any King should return, unless he were a descendant of
Elendil from Isildur not Anárion. But from Pelendur onwards the Ruling
Stewards were determined not to receive any such claimant, but to remain
supreme rulers of Gondor. It may anyway be observed that though Quenya
names were not used, those used were probably *all* the names of
renowned heroes in the royal lines of old as recorded in legend. Some
may come from tales now lost; but Húrin, Túrin, Hador, Barahir, Dior,
Denethor, Orodreth, Ecthelion, Egalmoth, Beren are from legends
recorded.

**fn3** Of old. The matter of corrupted or malicious elvish beings is
elsewhere considered. According to the Elves these were mainly
disembodied Elves, who had met with some mortal damage, but rebelled
against the summons to their spirits to go to their place of Awaiting.
Those who so rebelled were mostly those who had been slain in the course
of some wrong-doing. Thus they wandered as "houseless" elf-souls,
invisible except in the form of *indemmar* that they could induce in
others, and filled often with malice and envy of the "living", whether
elvish or human.

### VIII Knowledge and Memory {#viii-knowledge-and-memory .a-head-space-after}

uses fear: this is one of the greatest wrongs that he commits.

### IX *Ósanwe-kenta* {#ix-ósanwe-kenta .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Here *níra* ('will' as a potential or faculty) since the minimum
requirement is that this faculty shall not be exerted in denial; action
or an act of will is *nirme*; as *sanwe* 'thought' or 'a thought' is the
action or an act of *sáma*.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-936)

**fn2** It may be occupied with thinking and inattentive to other
things; it may be "turned towards Eru"; it may be engaged in
"thought-converse" with a third mind. Pengolodh says: "Only great minds
can converse with more than one other at the same time; several may
confer, but then at one time only one is imparting, while the others
receive".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-937)

**fn3** No mind can, however, be closed against Eru, either against His
inspection or against His message. The latter it may not heed, but it
cannot say it did not receive it.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-938)

**fn4** Pengolodh adds: "Some say that Manwë, by a special grace to the
King, could still in a measure perceive Eru; others more probably, that
he remained nearest to Eru, and Eru was most ready to hear and answer
him".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-939)

**fn5** Pengolodh here evidently refers to Sauron in particular, from
whose arising he fled at last from Middle-earth. But the first
destruction of the bodily form of Sauron was recorded in the histories
of the Elder Days, in the *Lay of Leithian*.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-940)

**fn6** Pengolodh here elaborates (though it is not necessary for his
argument) this matter of "foresight". No mind, he asserts, knows what is
not in it. All that it has experienced is in it, though in the case of
the Incarnate, dependent upon the instruments of the *hröa*, some things
may be "forgotten", not immediately available for recollection. But no
part of the "future" is there, for the mind cannot see it or have seen
it: that is, a mind placed in time. Such a mind can learn of the future
only from another mind which has seen it. But that means only from Eru
ultimately, or mediately from some mind that has seen in Eru some part
of His purpose (such as the Ainur who are now the Valar in Eä). An
Incarnate can thus only know anything of the future, by instruction
derived from the Valar, or by a revelation coming direct from Eru. But
any mind, whether of the Valar or of the Incarnate, may deduce by reason
what will or may come to pass. This is not *foresight*, not though it
may be clearer in terms and indeed even more accurate than glimpses of
foresight. Not even if it is formed into visions seen in dream, which is
a means whereby "foresight" also is frequently presented to the mind.

Minds that have great knowledge of the past, the present, and the nature
of Eä may predict with great accuracy, and the nearer the future the
clearer (saving always the freedom of Eru). Much therefore of what is
called "foresight" in careless speech is only the deduction of the wise;
and if it be received, as warning or instruction, from the Valar, it may
be only deduction of the wiser, though it may sometimes be "foresight"
at second hand.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-941)

**fn7** *enda*. This we translate 'heart', though it has no physical
reference to any organ of the *hröa*. It means "centre", and refers
(though by inevitable physical allegory) to the *fëa* or *sáma* itself,
distinct from the periphery (as it were) of its contacts with the
*hröa*; self-aware; endowed with the primeval wisdom of its making which
made it sensitive to anything inimical in the least degree.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-942)

**fn8** For which reason Melkor often spoke the truth, and indeed he
seldom lied without any admixture of truth. Unless it was in his lies
against Eru; and it was, maybe, for uttering these that he was cut off
from return.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-943)

**fn9** Some hold that, though evil might then have been mitigated, it
could not have been undone even by Melkor repentant; for power had gone
forth from him and was no longer under the control of his will. Arda was
marred in its very being. The seeds that the hand sows will grow and
multiply though the hand be removed.

had befallen Men before they became acquainted with them, sufficient to
damage or alter the conditions under which they lived, especially with
regard to their "death" and their attitude towards it. But of this Men,
even the Atani with whom they became closely associated, would never
speak clearly. "There is a shadow behind us", they would say, but would
not explain what that meant.

### XI Fate and Free Will {#xi-fate-and-free-will .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** But Minas Ithil and especially Minas Anor (Tirith) were 'towers'
in the sense of *barad*, but derived their names from their high central
tower, in days when the main dwelling-city of Gondor was at Osgiliath.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-946)

**fn2** Originally 'fortification', defence, not necessarily very large
or permanent; a defensive camp with walls of earth and a ditch was an
*osto*.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-947)

**fn3** E.g. one of the Eldar would have said that for all Elves and Men
the shape, condition, and therefore the past and future physical
development and destiny of this "earth" was determined and beyond their
power to change, indeed beyond the power even of the Valar to alter in
any large and permanent way. (They distinguished between "change" and
redirection. Thus any "rational \[?will-user\]" could in a small way
move, re-direct, stop, or destroy objects in the world; but he could not
"change" \[them\] into *something* *else*. They did *not* confuse
analysis with change, e.g. water/steam, oxygen, hydrogen.) The Downfall
of Númenor was "a miracle" as we might say, or as they a *direct action
of* Eru within time that altered the previous scheme for all remaining
time. They would probably also have said that Bilbo was "fated" to find
the Ring, but not necessarily to surrender it; and then if Bilbo
surrendered it Frodo was fated to go on his mission, but not necessarily
to destroy the Ring --- which in fact he did not do. They would have
added that *if* the downfall of Sauron and the destruction of the Ring
was part of Fate (or Eru's Plan) then if Bilbo had retained the Ring and
refused to surrender it, some other means would have arisen by which
Sauron was frustrated: just as when Frodo's will proved in the end
inadequate, a means for the Ring's destruction immediately appeared ---
being kept in reserve by Eru as it were.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-948)

**fn4** Thus if a man set out on a journey with the *purpose* of finding
his enemy, and the purpose then of doing this or that (pardoning
him/asking his pardon/cursing him/seeking to slay him): That purpose
governs the whole process. It may be frustrated by "chance" (-- in fact
he never met him --) or it may be helped by chance (-- in fact against
likelihood he did meet him), but in the latter case if he did evil he
could not \[?throw\] the blame on "chance".

### XII The Knowledge of the Valar {#xii-the-knowledge-of-the-valar .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** At this time there was no way for the Incarnate *direct* to Eru,
and though the Eldar knew well that the power of the Valar to counsel or
assist them was only delegated, it was through them that they sought for
enlightenment or aid from Eru.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-951)

**fn2** "Evil", in the arrogance and egotism of Melkor, had already
appeared in the first attempts of the Spirits to express the Design of
Eru communicated to them only in pure direct "thought". This was
represented as taking the form of *music:* the Music of the Ainur (Holy
Ones). In this Melkor, and those influenced by him, had introduced
things of Melkor's own thought and design, causing great discords and
confusion.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-952)

**fn3** This is said because the invitation given to the Eldar to remove
to Valinor and live unendangered by Melkor was not in fact according to
the design of Eru. It arose from anxiety, and it might be said from
failure in trust of Eru, from anxiety and fear of Melkor, and the
decision of the Eldar to accept the invitation was due to the
overwhelming effect of their contact, while still in their inexperienced
youth, with the bliss of Aman and the beauty and majesty of the Valar.
It had disastrous consequences in diminishing the Elves of Middle-earth
and so depriving Men of a large measure of the intended help and
teaching of their "elder brethren", and exposing them more dangerously
to the power and deceits of Melkor. Also since it was in fact alien to
the nature of the Elves to live under protection in Aman, and not (as
was intended) in Middle-earth, one consequence was the revolt of the
Noldor.

### XIII Spirit {#xiii-spirit .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Not that in Elvish thought "spirits" were conceived of as weak,
thin, or only partly real: on the contrary *naked* and *obdurate* are
the two adjectives most frequently applied to *fëar*. But the Eldar
assert that "phantoms", reminding one of half-luminous exhalations, can
be seen. They say that the *fëa* or spirit "remembers" its body (which
it has inhabited in every part equally) and can present this mental
picture to other *fëar* in a vapour or more or less wavering form,
according to the clarity of vision and sensitivity of either party; this
"phantom" is frequently seen (by those so gifted even among Men, but
more readily by Elves) at or soon after the departure of a *fëa* from
its body.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-954)

**fn2** The ordinary use of bodily instruments was usually necessary to
an Incarnate (*mírondina*); though those in whom the *fëa* was dominant
(a matter usually of *age*; for though some *fëar* were endowed from the
beginning with greater power than others, all *fëar* were held to grow
more dominant with respect to their *hrondo* as their life advanced)
could do this in a small degree, and in a greater degree affect other
*fëar* --- by what we should call 'telepathy', Q. *palantímië* or
*palanyantië*.

### XIV The Visible Forms of the Valar and Maiar {#xiv-the-visible-forms-of-the-valar-and-maiar .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** This applied only to those uncorrupted. Melkor, they said, was
invisible, and his presence was revealed only by great dread and by a
darkness that dimmed or blotted out the light and hues of all things
near him. The Maiar corrupted by him stank. For this reason neither he
nor any of the evil Maiar ever approached one of the Eldar that they
wished to persuade or deceive except clad in their *fanar.* These they
could still make to appear beautiful to Elvish eyes, if they wished ---
until after the great treachery of Melkor and the destruction of the
Trees. After that Melkor (Morgoth) and his servants were perceived as
forms of evil and enemies undisguised.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-957)

**fn2** The *fanar* of the great Valar were said by the Eldar who had
dwelt in Valinor usually to have had a stature far greater than that of
the tallest Elves, and when performing some great deed or rite, or
issuing commands, to have assumed an awe-inspiring height.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-958)

**fn3** These were called in Quenya *indemmar* 'mind-pictures'.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-959)

**fn4** Or mainly so: the power of the presence of one of these spirits
no doubt affected the reception and was responsible, for instance, for
the impressions of "radiance" with which the "vision" was endowed.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-960)

**fn5** Subject only to special limitations voluntarily taken upon
themselves or decreed by Eru. Thus after the final establishment of
Arda, when the Valar, the spirits destined to be most concerned with
this chosen stage for combat with Melkor, took up their abode on
Middle-earth, they no longer passed beyond its confines. That is,
according to Elvish tradition they remained, usually clad in their
*fanar*, in physical residence on earth as its guardians.

### XV Elvish Reincarnation {#xv-elvish-reincarnation .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Or nearly so. They may indeed be "virtually", that is in all
operations or effects in the service of higher forms, identical. But the
loremasters tell us that they may be in themselves not wholly and
exactly equivalent. Some of the loremasters hold that the substance of
Arda (or indeed of all Eä) was in the beginning one thing, the *erma*;
but not since the beginning has it remained one and the same, alike and
equivalent, in all times and places. In the first shapings this primary
substance or *erma* became varied and divided into many secondary
materials or *nassi*, which have within themselves various patterns,
whereby they differ one from another inwardly, and outwardly have
different virtues and effects. In so far, therefore, as the separate
*nassi* maintain their characteristic patterns within, all fractions of
the same *nassë* are equivalent and indistinguishable, and with regard
to higher forms may be said to be "the same". But the Valar, through or
by whom these variations were effected as the first step in the
production of the riches of Eä, and who therefore have full knowledge of
the *nassi* and their combinations, report that there are minute
variations of pattern within one *nassë*. These are very rare (and their
origins or purposes the Valar have not disclosed); yet it can thus
happen that in comparing a quantity of one *nassë* with another equal
quantity of the same *nassë* the subtle in skill may find that the one
quantity contains *únehtar* (the smallest quantities possible in which
the interior pattern that distinguishes it from other *nassi* is
exhibited) varying somewhat from the norm. Or both quantities may
contain the variant *únehtar*, but in different numbers. In such cases
the two quantities will not be precisely equivalent; though it may be
held that the difference between them is so incalculably small that
their virtues as materials for the making of embodiments of living
patterns are indistinguishable.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-962)

**fn2** Míriel is thus first case -- *there were no* dead in Aman before
that. Hence accommodation in House of Vairë.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-963)

**fn3** The houseless *fëa* *itself* *rebuilt* its *hröa* to fit. This
is far and away the best solution. This power might be limited, e.g. by
requiring permission; by only being possible in Aman, etc. Transport of
the re-housed *fëa* back to its "home" (or place of death) could be more
frequent, but always according to the judgement of Mandos. This
permission would principally depend on cause of death and/or the worth
of an elf concerned. An elf whom Mandos judged should be long retained
"naked" would not usually be allowed to return to Middle-earth ---
things and relationships would have changed there. An elf allowed
quickly to re-house itself might "return" very soon after death.

This power of the *fëa* to rebuild its "house" is much the best, because
only the *fëa* can *inherently and by experience* know its own house.
Its memory is so strong that it can in another *fëa* (incarnate) induce
a picture of it, so that it seems a phantom form. A "phantom" is the
reverse of vision = seeing. Vision reaching the mind/*fëa* via the
bodily senses is transformed into a "picture" (which *may* be then
preserved in memory). But if a mind receives a pictorial impression
*direct* it *may* (if itself sufficiently interested or impressed)
translate this into "sight", and the physical organs being stimulated
will see --- a phantom, which not being produced by a physical
\[?presentation\] cannot be touched, but can be walked through. Since
"eyes" will project a vision forwards and this will *retreat* (keeping
same apparent distance away) or will vanish as soon as the "seer"
reaches the point at which it was externalized.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-964)

**fn4** And therefore "identical", though there is no space here to
discuss the precise meaning of this.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-965)

**fn5** E.g. possibly of "Mannish" origin, since nearly all the matter
of the *Silmarillion* is contained in myths and legends that have passed
through men's hands and minds, and are (in many points) plainly
influenced by contact and confusion with the myths, and theories, and
legends of Men.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-966)

long maintain their coherence, and even sometimes endure in fair form as
if they slept only. That this is true the Elves know by proof; but the
purpose or reason is not to them clear. Men say that it is the bodies of
the holy that sometimes remain long incorrupt: meaning those of whom the
*fëar* were strong and yet were turned ever towards Eru in love and
hope. This endurance of the body they believe, therefore, to be a sign
from Eru for the increase of hope. For Men, even more than the Elves,
abhor the sight of decay.

### VI Dwellings in Middle-earth {#vi-dwellings-in-middle-earth .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** English *settle* in its various branches of meaning closely
resembles the development of the meanings of *√mbar*: thus *settlement*
can mean the act of colonizing or taking up an abode, or the area or
place so occupied (by a family or community); or (the terms of) an
agreement fixed after debate. The development was not, however, the
same: the senses of *settle* proceed from a sense 'place in or take up'
a firm position, especially in a place that seems suitable; from which
the sense of settling affairs that were in confusion or doubt arose.
*√mbar* meant basically to make a decision, and the meanings relating to
dwelling or occupying land proceeded from that.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-971)

**fn2** *Umbar* could thus correspond to History, the known or at least
the already unfolded part, together with the *Future*, progressively
realized. To the latter it most often referred, and is rendered *Fate*
or *Doom*. But this is inaccurate, so far as genuine Elvish, especially
High-elvish, is concerned, since it was not in that use applied only to
evil events.

**fn1** By physical means, as by a ship, it was made impossible, after
the rape of the Telerian ships at Alqualondë, nor could any living
creature of Middle-earth, such as birds, however strong, cross the Great
Sea. And all the Valar and Maiar were forbidden by Manwë to set foot on
the land where the Ñoldor dwelt. Some say on any soil of Middle-earth at
all.

was begun early in the history of that land) the first beginnings of
that arrogance which ultimately destroyed that realm.

**fn3** The most notable were those Maiar who took the form of the
mighty speaking eagles that we hear of in the legends of the war of the
Ñoldor against Melkor, and who remained in the West of Middle-earth
until the fall of Sauron and the Dominion of Men, after which they are
not heard of again. Their intervention in the story of Maelor, in the
duel of Fingolfin and Melkor, in the rescue of Beren and Lúthien is well
known. (Beyond their knowledge were the deeds of the Eagles in the war
against Sauron: in the rescue of the Ring Finder and his companions, in
the Battle of Five Armies, and in the rescue of the Ringbearer from the

until summoned by Eru, and departed whither neither the Valar nor the

### XI Lives of the Númenóreans {#xi-lives-of-the-númenóreans .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** The Númenóreans were monogamous, as is later said. No one, of
whatever rank, could divorce a husband or wife, nor take another spouse
in the lifetime of the first. Marriage was not entered into by all.
There was (it appears from occasional statements in the few surviving
tales or annals) a slightly less number of women than men, at any rate
in the earlier centuries. But apart from this numerical limitation,
there was always a small minority that refused marriage, either because
they were engrossed in lore or other pursuits, or because they had
failed to obtain the spouse whom they desired and would seek for no
other.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-983)

**fn2** Since in matters of growth, which included the conception and
bearing of children, the Númenórean development differed little in speed
from that of ordinary Men, these intervals seem long. But as has been
said their mental interests were dominant; and also they gave great and
concentrated attention to any matter that they took up. The matter of
children, therefore, being of highest importance, was one that occupied
most of the attention of the mother during bearing and infancy, and
except in great households cast a great deal of the daily labour upon
the father. Both were glad for a while to return to other neglected
pursuits. But also (it was said by the Númenóreans themselves) they were
in this matter more like the Eldar than other kinds of Men: in the
begetting and still more in the bearing of a child far more of their
vigour both of body and mind was expended (for the longevity of the
later generations was, though a grace or gift, transmitted mediately by
the parents). A rest both of body and will was, therefore, needed,
especially by the women. After the conception of a child indeed desire
for union became dormant for a while, in both men and women, though
longer among the mothers.

This dominance was seen in other matters. If the Númenóreans were not
lustful, they did not think the love of men and women less important or
of less delight than did other Men. On the contrary they were steadfast
lovers; and any breaches in the bonds and affection between parents, or
between them and their children were thought great evils and sorrows. So
with the delights of eating and drinking. Until the Shadow came there
were in Númenor few gluttons or drunkards. No one ate or drank to
excess, or indeed much at any one time. They esteemed good food, which
was plentiful, and expended care and art in its cooking and serving. But
the distinction between a "Feast" and an ordinary meal consisted rather
in this: in the adornments of the table, in the music, and in the
merriment of many eating together, than in the food; though naturally at
such feasts food and wines of more rare and choice sorts would sometimes
appear.

**fn3** Thus to mention the case of Erendis, wife of Tar-Aldarion,
concerning whom there were several tales made (one has survived), since
the events were held important: both as a rare case of dissension
between the married, and because they caused an alteration in the laws
of succession. She was not of the Line of Elros, but came of a Bëorian
family of the West, who though descended from a kinswoman of Beren, were
among the relatively short-lived. Her marriage with Aldarion (then Heir
to the Sceptre) was delayed by his voyages until S.A. 870. Since she was
born in 771, she was then of 99 years: that is, nearly 36, or indeed
with regard to the shorter life-span of her people 38. After the birth
of their child, Ankalimë, Aldarion went again oversea; and on his return
late in 882 she was of years 111; that is, just over 38 (or in her
family nearly 41), her expectation of children, and her desire for them,
thus fast waning. In her anger (for she thought his departures wilful
and selfish, though this was not in the main true), she rejected
Aldarion, and they did not again dwell together nor have any more
children. It was for this reason, and to obtain control of their
daughter Ankalimë, to whom Erendis clung, that Tar-Aldarion, soon after
he became king, altered the Law of Succession, so that a king's
daughter, if he had no male heir (and later, if she were his eldest
child and all her brothers younger) might, if she were willing, succeed
to the Sceptre.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-985)

**fn4** Ankalimë, daughter of Tar-Aldarion, who became the first Ruling
Queen of Númenor, was exceptional in many ways. She was extremely
long-lived (413 years); she had the longest reign (205 years) of any
Ruler of Númenor after Elros; and she married very late: in her 127th
year (age about 41) producing a son, Anárion, in her 130th year. With
regard to more normal successions, it may be noted that Tar-Meneldur,
born in S.A. 543, succeeded in 740 in his 197th year. He would in the
usual course have probably resigned about 925 (when 382 years old, and
after a reign of 185 years); his heir Aldarion would then have been 225
years old. Actually for domestic and political reasons he resigned in
883, and lived on in retirement (engaged in his favourite pursuit of
astronomy) until 942. Thus Aldarion succeeded when 183 years old (age
about 52) and had a long reign of 192 years, resigning in 1075, and
dying in 1098.

**fn5** Sicknesses or other bodily disorders were very rare in Númenor
until the latter years. This was due both to the special grace of health
and strength given to the race as a whole, but especially due to the
blessing of the land itself; and also in some measure no doubt to its
situation far out in the Great Sea: animals were also mostly free from
disease. But the few cases of sickness provided a practical function, so
far as one was needed, for the continued study of *hröangolmë* (or
physiology and medicine) in which the practisers of simple leechcraft
among the Edain had received much instruction from the Eldar, and in
which they were able still to learn from the Eressëans, so long as they
would. In the first days of the coming of Númenórean ships to the shores
of Middle-earth it was indeed their skill in healing, and their
willingness to give instruction to all who would receive it, that made
the Númenóreans most welcomed and esteemed.

Since some of the Númenórean crews that went on the first long voyages
of exploration (far south and east of Lindon) fell sick or contracted
diseases prevalent in the lands that they visited, it was feared by many
in Númenor that the Venturers or explorers might bring back disease to
the land. It was this fear in especial that made Tar-Meneldur opposed to
his son Tar-Aldarion's longer voyages, and caused a coolness between
father and son for a long time. But it was found that those of the sick
who were brought back living (few in fact died abroad before the actual
settlements of Númenóreans in Middle-earth) soon recovered fully in
their own land, and their diseases were not propagated.

### XIII Of the Land and Beasts of Númenor {#xiii-of-the-land-and-beasts-of-númenor .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** The lower slopes of the Menel-tarma were gentle and partly
grass-covered, but the mountain grew ever steeper, and the last 500 feet
were in places unscalable, save by the climbing road.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-988)

**fn2** It seems to have been long before the Númenóreans themselves
ventured far to sea in ship, after the Elvish steersmen had returned,
taking with them most of the original vessels of the migration. But they
had shipwrights who had been instructed by the Eldar; and from these
beginnings they soon devised vessels more suitable to their own uses.
The first ships of heavier draught were made for the coastwise traffic
between ports.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-989)

**fn3** The increase was slow, in spite of the absence of disease and
the rarity of death by misadventure, because of the long lives of the
Númenóreans in which they produced few children: the average in each
"generation" being somewhat more than three times half the total number
of the generation, less than four to each possible marriageable pair. At
least one third of the original immigrants produced no children in
Númenor.

### XVI Galadriel and Celeborn {#xvi-galadriel-and-celeborn .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** The stouter and more spreading trees, such as oaks and beeches,
were called in C.E. *galadā* 'great growth'; though this distinction was
not always observed in Quenya, and disappeared in Sindarin. In S. *orn*
\< \**ornē* fell out of common use and was used only in verse and songs,
though it survived in many names, of trees and persons. All trees were
called *galað* \< \**galadā*.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-991)

**fn2** Derivatives were \**nadmā* \> Q. *nanwa* 'a (large) bowl' or
similar artefact; \**nandā* 'hollow' (not used of things empty inside
but those open above); \**nandē* 'a valley, bottom', originally used
only of not very large areas the sides of which were part of their own
configuration. Vales or valleys of great extent, plains at the feet of
mountains, etc. had other names. As also had the very steep-sided
valleys in the mountains such as Rivendell. Those such as the valley of
Gondolin which were more or less circular, but deeply concave, and had
high mountains at the rim were called \**tumbu*. The vale of Gondolin
was actually called *iTumbo* (in full *i Tumbo Tarmacorto* 'the vale of
the high-mountain circle', in Sindarin *Tum Orchorod*) and usually in S.
*Tumlaðen* 'Wide valley'.

### XVII Silvan Elves and Silvan Elvish {#xvii-silvan-elves-and-silvan-elvish .a-head-space-after}

**fn1** Hence they were called by the Vanyar and Noldor the *Teleri*,
the backward; but those who eventually reached Valinor retained their
own name (Lindar, or in their tongue *Lindai*). Lindarin (L) is thus
used for the language of the Teleri of Valinor, in many ways the most
archaic and least changed of the Eldarin languages.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-993)

**fn2** These at that remote time appear to have been continuous with
the White Mountains.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-994)

**fn3** Probably that mountain afterwards known as *Caraðras*; though
unless its awe-inspiring peak was magnified in legend, it was then
loftier than in later ages. "Under" plainly means "under the shadow of";
for there were as yet no Dwarves in those mountains, and the mines of
Moria had not been begun. Neither, fortunately for the Eldar, had the
Orks of Morgoth yet reached those regions.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-995)

**fn4** In Valinor the conditions were different. Change though it was
imperceptibly slow proceeded even in the Blessed Realm; but unheeded
change in speech was controlled by memory and design, and the chief
changes, which were considerable, were due to changes in "taste" and to
inventiveness both in vocabulary and the devices of language.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-996)

**fn5** Their divergence might be compared with that of the Scandinavian
dialects from the English at the time of the Norse settlements in
England, though it was in some respects somewhat greater, and in some
regions (notably Lórien) mixed language developed, in which Sindarin was
dominant but was infected by many words and names of Silvan origin.

**fn6** He was the father of Thranduil, father of Legolas.

**fn7** Oropher was of Sindarin origin (cf. LR III 363) and no doubt his
son was following the example of King Thingol, long before in Doriath;
though his halls were not to be compared with Menegroth. He had not the
arts nor the wealth nor the aid of the Dwarves; and compared with the
Elves of Doriath his Silvan folk were rude and rustic. He had come among
them with only a handful of Sindar, and they were soon merged with the
Silvan Elves, adopting their language and taking names of Silvan form
and style. This they did deliberately; for they (and other similar
adventurers forgotten in the legends or only briefly named) came from
Doriath after its ruin, and had no desire to leave Middle-earth, nor to
be merged with the other Sindar of Beleriand, dominated by the Noldorin
Exiles for whom the folk of Doriath had no great love. They wished
indeed to become Silvan folk and to return, as they said, to the simple
life natural to the Elves before the invitation of the Valar had
disturbed it. Thus already in the Second Age Oropher had withdrawn
northward beyond the confluence of the Gladden and Anduin: to be free
from the power and encroachments of the Dwarves of Moria, and still
more, after the fall of Eregion, from the "domination" of Celeborn and
Galadriel. They had passed through Moria with a considerable following
of Noldorin Exiles and dwelt for many years in Lórien. Thither they
returned twice before the Last Alliance and the end of the Second Age;
and in the Third Age, when the Shadow of Sauron's recovery arose, they
dwelt there again for a long time. In her wisdom Galadriel foresaw that
Lórien would be a stronghold and point of power to prevent the Shadow
from crossing the Anduin in the war that must inevitably come before it
was again defeated (if that were possible); but that it needed a rule of
greater wisdom and strength than the Silvan folk possessed. Nonetheless,
it was not until the disaster in Moria, when by means beyond the
foresight of Galadriel Sauron's power actually crossed the Anduin and
Lórien was in great peril, its king lost, its people fleeing and likely
to leave it deserted to be occupied by Orks, that Celeborn and Galadriel
took up their permanent abode in Lórien, and its government. But they
took no title of King or Queen, and were the guardians that in the event
brought it unviolated through the War of the Ring.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-999)

**fn8** While Isildur stayed for a year or more in Gondor
re-establishing its order and its bounds (as is told in the Tale of
Cirion and Eorl, that drew on ancient chronicles now lost), the main
forces of the realm of Elendil in Arnor had returned to Eriador by the
Númenórean road from the Fords of Isen to Lake Evendim. When Isildur at
last felt free to return to his own realm, he was in haste, and he
wished to come first to Imladris where he had left his youngest son and
his wife. The western road would take him far out of his way; for he
could not strike north from the road because of the treacherous marshes
of the Gwathló; he would have been obliged to follow the road to Evendim
until it crossed the great East-West Road of Arnor, only some 40 miles
east of the Baranduin. That led straight to Imladris, but it was more
than 300 miles from the road-crossing to Imladris, as great a distance
as from the inflow of the Celebrant to the high pass in the Mountains
leading to Imladris, if one went north along the Anduin. (By that pass a
great part of Gilgalad's army had come on the way to Mordor.) He
therefore determined to march north up the vales of Anduin.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1000)

**fn9** By which he does not (probably) refer far back to the end of the
first millennium of the Third Age, when a shadow fell on Greenwood the
Great and it began to be called Mirkwood: see Tale of Years, L.R. III
366 \[i.e. LR:1085\]; though it was no doubt this "Shadow" spreading
from Dol Guldur that caused the Galadhrim who lived in the southern
parts of Greenwood to retreat further and further north, and eventually
made communication with those that remained west of Anduin rare and
difficult. He is principally thinking of the end of the second
millennium, when the power of Sauron, now revived, was felt in all the
lands east of Anduin and was a growing threat to the narrow lands
between it and the Misty Mountains. It is not recorded how long Amroth
had been king of Lórien, but either as hereditary chieftain, associated
with Galadriel and Celeborn as "advisers and guardians", or alone in
times of their absence, he must have dwelt ever since Third Age 1000 in
growing disquiet, until the disaster (no doubt ultimately due to Sauron)
of T.A. 1980 when a Balrog arose in Moria and it was abandoned by the
Dwarves and became filled with the servants of Sauron. Nimrodel and many
others of the Silvan folk fled south, and Amroth seeking for Nimrodel
never returned. Lórien would no doubt have been deserted and left open
to Sauron if Celeborn and Galadriel had not returned and taken over the
rule, supported by the Elves of Noldorin and Sindarin origin, who were
already a large part of the people of Lórien.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1001)

**fn10** In this task at one time the Elves had the assistance of the
Dwarves of Moria. For these had had alliances and friendship with the
Elves of Eregion, and they were well-disposed to Lórien, where many of
the survivors of Eregion had taken refuge.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1002)

**fn11** Unless it was Nimrodel. Her motives were different. She loved
the waters and the falls of Nimrodel from which she would not long be
parted; but as times darkened the stream was too near the north borders
and in a part where few of the Galadhrim now dwelt. Maybe it was from
her that Amroth took the idea of living in a high flet.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1003)

**fn12** The stem RAT (of which RATH was probably an emphatic variation
in Primitive Eldarin) meant 'to find a way', applied to persons
journeying in the wild; to travel in roadless land; and also to streams
and rivers and their courses. A derivative was P.E. \**rantā*, applied
to the tracks and trails of travellers or explorers that had become
habitual and could be followed by others. It was also, especially in
Sindarin, applied to the courses of rivers, as in *Celebrant*
('Silverlode'). Cf. also the *Gondrant*, the stone-trail of the great
wains of the quarriers in the Stonewain Valley, *Tum* *Gondregain*,
north of Minas Tirith.

Men of Good Will, who lived in Eriador and Calenardhon and the Vales of
Anduin and in the Great Wood and the plains between that and Mordor and
the Sea of Rhûn. In Eriador there were actually some of the remnants of
the Three Houses of Men that had fought with the Elves against Morgoth.
Others were of their kin, who (like the Silvan Elves) had never passed
the Ered Luin, and others of remoter kin. But nearly all were
descendants of ancient rebels against Morgoth. (Some evil men there were
also.)

it.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1006)

**fn2** All Elves were naturally skilled in making boats, but the craft
that were to make a long voyage over Sea, perilous even to Elven-craft
until Middle-earth was far behind, required more skill and knowledge.

**fn6** For the Númenórean view of the previous inhabitants see
Faramir's conversation with Frodo, especially II 287 \[i.e. LR:678--9\].
The Rohirrim were according to his classification *Middle Men*, and
their importance to Gondor in his time is chiefly in mind and modifies
his account; the description of the various men of the southern "fiefs"
of Gondor, who were mainly of non-Númenórean descent, shows that other
kinds of Middle Men, descended from others of the Three Houses of the
Edain, lingered in the West, in Eriador (as the Men of Bree), or further
south --- notably the people of Dor-en-Ernil (Dol Amroth).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1011)

**fn7** Because such matters had little interest for the Gondorian
chroniclers; and also because it was assumed that they had in general
remained faithful to the monotheism of the Dúnedain, allies and pupils
of the Eldar. Before the removal of most of the survivors of these
"Three Houses of Men" to Númenor, there is no mention of the reservation
of a high place for worship of the One and the ban on all temples built
by hand, which was characteristic of the Númenóreans until their
rebellion, and which among the Faithful (of whom Elendil was the leader)
after the Downfall and the loss of the Meneltarma became a ban on all
places of worship.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1012)

**fn8** The Men of Darkness built temples, some of great size, usually
surrounded by dark trees, often in caverns (natural or delved) in secret
valleys of mountain-regions; such as the dreadful halls and passages
under the Haunted Mountain beyond the Dark Door (Gate of the Dead) in
Dunharrow. The special horror of the closed door before which the
skeleton of Baldor was found was probably due to the fact that the door
was the entrance to an evil temple hall to which Baldor had come,
probably without opposition up to that point. But the door was shut in
his face, and enemies that had followed him silently came up and broke
his legs and left him to die in the darkness, unable to find any way
out.

### PART ONE: TIME AND AGEING {#part-one-time-and-ageing-1 .a-head-space-after}

### I The Valian Year {#i-the-valian-year .a-head-space-after}

**1** In the c. 1937 *Annals of Valinor*, the Valian Year is implied to
be, as here, exactly the same as 10 sun-years: "The First Ages are
reckoned as 30,000 \[sun-\]years, or 3,000 years of the Valar" (V:118).
This was also the case in the first version of the c. 1951 *Annals of
Aman* (X:50, and see X:57--8 n.17).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1015)

**2** Tolkien here actually wrote: "of the 14,400^th^ Valian Year", an
obvious slip of the pen.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1016)

**3** In the c. 1951 *Annals of Aman* the Elves awoke (as here) in VY
1050 and arrived in Aman in VY 1132 (X:71, 84) and in VY 1500 the Sun
and the Moon were fashioned and first rose (X:131); and with that first
sunrise Men awoke (X:130). At the time that Tolkien was (first) working
on the *AAm* the Valian Year was still just 10 sun-years, and so Men
awoke 1500 -- 1050 = 450 × 10 = 4,500 years after the Elves. Here, with
the VY = 144 SY, Men awoke 1150 -- 1050 = 100 × 144 = 14,400: a more
than three-fold increase in time.

It may further be noted that, since, by the time he wrote text 2,
Tolkien had decided that the Sun and the Moon were coëval with Arda, the
awakening of Men no longer has any chronological correspondence with
either the return of the Exiles to Middle-earth or the first rising of
the Sun, and so there is no mention of them.

### III Of Time in Arda {#iii-of-time-in-arda-1 .a-head-space-after}

**1** The full significance of this statement will become clearer in
part two of this book, esp. in chap. XV, "Elvish Reincarnation"; and cf.
my introduction to part two. What it means, in short, is that the Valar
give material form to the basic, undifferentiated prime matter (Q.
*erma*) of Arda, in accordance with the Music of the *Ainulindalë* and
the Vision of Arda shown to them by Eru prior to its physical creation;
and so are, in a sense, its spirit.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1019)

**2** "*Elendil* (\< *eledndil*)": The TS here actually reads: "(\<
*eld-ndil*)", but this seems a likely typographical error; cf. the form
derivation "*Eled-ndil* \> *Elendil*" in the preceding MS version. With
the citation of Quenya/Old English pairings here of the names
Valandil/Oswine ('lover of the Valar' and 'God-friend', respectively)
and Elendil/Ælfwine ('lover of the Elves' and 'Elf-friend',
respectively), see the significant paired use of these same names in the
c. 1937 *The Lost Road* (V:7 ff.), the c. 1945 *Notion Club Papers*
(esp. Part II, IX: 222 ff.), and the subsequent *Drowning of Anadûnê*
(IX:331 ff.).

The typescript ends with this lengthy note, at the bottom of a page,
with only: "√[*ndur*]{.underline}" following (indicating the intent to
begin a discussion of the stem √*ndur* as in the manuscript version; but
apparently never taken up).

inclination of the *fëa,*" cf. X:233. On the dual ends of marriage --
unity and procreation -- see the discussion of M[ARRIAGE]{.small} in
App. I. On the "kinship" of Incarnates "to all things in Arda, through
their *hröar*" see chap. II, "Primal Impulse", in part three of this
volume. With "a normally unbreakable bond (of feeling, not here to speak
of 'law')" see Tolkien's *Laws and Customs* *among the Eldar* (X:207
ff.) for a closely contemporary, thematically related, and expansive
discussion of marriage among the Elves.

**8** In chap. X, "Difficulties in Chronology", below, Anairë is said to
have been the mother of Idril and to have "refused the Exile". In all
other published sources that name her, Anairë is the wife of Fingolfin
and thus Idril's grandmother, not mother (cf. XI:323, XII:363).

usually from 3 to 9 years; but it might range from 2 years (very rarely
less) to 12 years (seldom more)". The alteration was made in red
ball-point pen. An earlier version of this paragraph (heavily struck
through) as first written has:

Gestation taking about 1 year, the days of begetting and of birth being
normally the same (or nearly so). The "Time of the Children" (*ontalúmë*
or *onnalúmë*) was in normal lives a continuous series occupying 10--50
years. The interval between children was \[?sometimes\] less than 2
\[?or as much as\] 12 years.

Cf. X:212: "As for the begetting and bearing of children: a year passes
between the begetting and the birth of an elf-child, so that the days of
both are the same or nearly so, and it is the day of begetting that is
remembered year by year."

This paragraph was subsequently altered in black nib-pen to read:

Gestation occupied (on the average) about the same time period as among
Mortals, though it was perhaps more variable, often being speedier, and
on occasion longer -- Feänor was borne in the womb for a whole year! The
"Time of the Children" (*ontalúmë* or *onnalúmë*) was in normal lives a
continuous series occupying 10--50 years. The interval between children
was between 3 and 9 years; but might be from 2 (rarely less) to 12 years
(rarely more).

The whole was then struck through in black nib-pen.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1035)

**16** As first written, this paragraph ended: "the Ñoldor grew to
maturity less quickly than did Sindar". The alteration was made in broad
nib-pen in the act of writing.

**18** As first written, this paragraph ended: "occupies a whole *yén*,
or 144 MY". Tolkien placed an "X" next to this paragraph, apparently
considering it for change/deletion, but did not in the event actually
strike it through. The changes to the time occupied by gestation were
made in red ball-point pen.

**20** With this "greater expense of the vigour of *hröa* and *fëa* (of
'youth' as the Eldar say) than is usual among Men" in the begetting of
children, cf. X:212.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1040)

**21** An earlier and increasingly hastier and difficult version of this
concluding section, subsequently struck through, reads:

Thus the Quendi do not "live slowly", achieving in 144 years only what a
mortal could in 1 year; they are not like tortoises moving ponderously
while Time flickers past them. Actually, they move and think rather
swifter than Men and get more into any given length of time than any Man
could. But they have a much greater natural *vitality and energy* to
draw upon, so that it takes very much longer to expend it all.

The procreative act and "gestation" thus take place quickly, at more or
less mortal speed, not taking 144 times as long! In fact, the act of
union does take longer and gestation a little longer -- it \[gestation\]
occupies a *löa* or sun-year in Middle-earth.

But the production of children expends a very great amount of physical
and spiritual energy; the desire for the next act is therefore at the
Elvish rate, and when we speak of a 3 year interval we thus mean 432
years.

All matters of *growth* which are not directly controlled by the
conscious *fëa* are slow in Quendi. Gestation therefore takes a very
long while -- about 144 MY, during all of which time husband and wife
are conscious of the growth of the child, and experience a much longer
joy and expectation. For Elvish childbirth is *not* accompanied by fear
or pain -- but there is a great expense of vigour followed by quiescence
and weariness in both of them. But the act of procreation not being one
of *growth* until the union of the seed and being under full control of
the will does not take long -- though it is longer and of more intense
delight in Elves than in Men: too intense to be long endured.

### V Natural Youth and Growth of the Quendi {#v-natural-youth-and-growth-of-the-quendi-1 .a-head-space-after}

**1** Tolkien replaced the original "1000 VY" with "96 Valian years" in
the act of writing. With the unfallen state of Elves, cf. chaps. VI,

**4** This sentence originally ended at "fatherhood", but was extended
by a marginal insertion in black nib-pen. This insertion originally
ended: "It was seldom if ever delayed beyond age", before it was struck
through. A later insertion, in red ballpoint -- above "until soon age 48
became regarded as" -- and subsequently struck through, appears to read:
"not by life-year but by growth-year, \[?by\] 12, 24, 48". The idea is
perhaps that the postponement resulted from an increase in the number of
"growth-years" in the Eldar.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1045)

**5** As first written, this sentence began: "It *could* occur up to
about a male age of 192, though it did not usually occur much after age
96". Next, the figure "192" was crossed through, and calculations added
in the line above that read: "24 + 144 (168 year period) 18 + 144
(162)". Subsequently, these calculations and everything between "192"
through "after age" were heavily struck through. The sentence originally
ended: "seldom if ever occurred".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1046)

**6** As first written, this sentence ended: "not seldom before they
were of age 20". The words "not seldom" were heavily deleted, and
replaced with "sometimes", which was also then struck through.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1047)

**7** This sentence is given as first written, despite subsequent
cross-throughs and additions, because the alterations do not seem to
have been carried through to completion to form a coherent revision. The
words "indeed some postponement" were lightly crossed-through, and a
rough note added above them reading (so far as I can now determine):
"\[??\] the date of \[?first birth\]"; and the words "\[?past growth\]"
were added above the word "usual" at apparently the same time. Finally,
the words "at 21 was the" were struck through, but with no replacement
or harmonization with the rest of the sentence supplied.

### VI The Awaking of the Quendi {#vi-the-awaking-of-the-quendi-1 .a-head-space-after}

**1** Christopher Tolkien notes (X:49) that: "*The Tale of Years*, a
chronological list of the same sort as that in Appendix B to *The Lord
of the Rings*, exists in different forms, associated with the earlier
and later *Annals*; the later form, closely associated with \[the
*Annals of Aman*\] and its companion the *Grey Annals* *(Annals of
Beleriand)*, is perhaps the most complex and difficult text of all that
my father left behind him." As such, the text, considered as a complex
of layers and developments, has only been partially edited and published
(see X:56--7, XI:342--54). The dates cited from the "Tale of Years"
here, however, agree with those in the c. 1951 *Annals of Aman* (or at
any rate, with their final forms; see X:47--8) in which (X:71) the
Quendi awake in VY 1050, and in which (X:72) Oromë finds them in VY 1085
(there said to be 335 of "our years", i.e. *löar*, after they awoke =
9.57 VY). Nor is there any indication given by Christopher Tolkien in
his editorial notes on *The Tale of Years* that these dates were any
different in that text as originally written.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1053)

**2** See X:50, §7: "each Year \[of the Valar\] ... is somewhat more
than are *nine and one half* of our years (nine and one half and eight
hundredths and yet a little)" (the parenthetical words being, however,
omitted in *The Tale of Years*, X:57 n.11); also X:59, §§5--10.

**3** The date VY 1102 again agrees precisely with *AAm* (X:81).

**6** Tolkien marked this paragraph as a crucial point with a large "\*"
in the margin against it. The "Vision", as an intervening stage between
the Music of the Ainur and the world being spoken into existence by Eru,
arose in the c. 1948 text C of the *Ainulindalë* (cf. X:11, §§12, 13;
X:14, §22; X:25--6).

**8** Tolkien marked this paragraph as a crucial point with a large
"\*\*" in the margin against it. With "screen of investment" cf. *OED*
"Investment", sense 2: "An outer covering of any kind; an envelope; a
coating"; also sense 4: "The surrounding or hemming in of a town or fort
by a hostile force so as to cut off all communication with the outside;
beleaguerment; blockade", and the quote illustrating this sense:
"Secrecy and speed are secured, in the investment of an inland fortress,
by the use of an advanced force of cavalry and horse artillery, which
conceals the march of the main body." If any such text as referred to
here ever existed, there is, alas, now no extant remnant of it known to
me.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1060)

**9** *AAm* likewise gives the date VY 1495 for the Death of the Two
Trees (X:98 ff.). Tolkien actually wrote "57,334" here as the length of
the existence of Men in Bel. 310, but that is a mathematical error. 395
VY × 144 = 56,880 + 310 = 57,190.

**17** For the potentially far-reaching (and greatly disruptive)
decision (or at any rate considered option) by Tolkien to make the Sun

Trees), and for the consequent "artificial" situation in Aman, see
X:369--90.

**18** The various possible rates, being all multiples of 12, evidence
what Tolkien elsewhere refers to as the "duodecimal system" of ratios.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1070)

**19** Tolkien replaced an earlier number, apparently 59,000, with
32,000 in the act of writing. The latter figure matches that calculated
for the Eldar at the Finding in "Scheme 2" of text 2 of chap. XVII.
"Generational Schemes", below; but see also the similar calculations in
chap. XV, "A Generational Scheme", below.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1071)

**20** The title is original, but the text numbering "II" is a later
addition in red ballpoint. See XI:344: "My father pencilled on the
typescript (referring to the interval since Morgoth's return from
Valinor in 1495): 'Too small a time for Morgoth to build Angband', and
also 'Time too small, should be 10 at least or 20 Valian Years'. This
would have required substantial modification of the chronology; and it
seems conceivable that this consideration was a factor in the emergence
of the later story that Utumno and Angband were distinct fortresses in
different regions, both built by Morgoth in ancient days (X:156, §12)."

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1072)

**21** *AAm* (X:98) agrees with the *Tale of Years* in giving VY 1495 as
the date of Melkor's escape, and also lists 1497 (X:118) as the date of
the return of the exiled Noldor to Middle-earth.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1073)

**22** Tolkien marked this passage as a crucial point with a manicule
(☞) in the left margin against it. Sometime later, in red ball-point
pen, he added the note beginning "*But see later*", which agrees with
the date (VY 1100) and agent (Sauron) of the corruption of Men set forth
in the second version.

In apparently contemporary writing amongst Tolkien linguistic papers is
a rejected sheet that, in addition to some Elvish etymologies, has this
note:

☞ The Disquiet of the Ñoldor must last a *long while* (the Fëanorëans
can dwell in the North of Aman a long while). *A long time must* be
allowed (a) for Men to appear and *diverge*, and (b) for Melkor to
corrupt them? They should "awake" just at his return to Middle-earth --
on an island. (Reason for his returning was his guessing of the Time.)

The whole Time in Beleriand must be extended to at least 1000 years
*unless* Men awake before the captivity of Melkor. Thus Fingolfin should
dwell *long* in Arvalin \[?south\] of Valinor.

Fingolfin is nowhere else depicted as having lived in Arvalin, which is
otherwise known only as a shadowy land south of Valinor, where Ungoliant
dwelt.

Against the first paragraph, in the margin, Tolkien wrote in ball-point
pen:

No, *corruption* of Men must occur before captivity.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1074)

**23** These comments were added later in red ball-point pen. Cf. the
similar later note Tolkien made to the corresponding passage in the
second version (B) of this text.

**24** See XI:14--15.

importance as a decision.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1077)

**26** The statement about Angband's prior existence entered as a
marginal note in the course of writing. The sense is that it must be
either that Angband arose in the same place, and on the only-partially
destroyed foundations of Utumno; or that Angband existed in a separate
place before the destruction of Utumno. The latter solution is that
described as "greatly to be preferred" in the "Note on Angband and
Utumno" in the second version (B) of this text.

**27** This note entered as a later marginal note in red ball-point pen.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1079)

**28** Against this passage, or at least against the statement that "Men
must awake before VY 1090", Tolkien subsequently wrote "no" in red
ball-point pen.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1080)

**29** Tolkien actually wrote here "64,434", but I have corrected this
calculation error.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1081)

**30** The parenthetical comment in this last sentence entered as a
contemporary marginal note. For the significance of the statement that
Tolkien is writing in the year 1960 "of the 7^th^ Age", see A[GES OF
THE]{.small} W[ORLD]{.small} in App. I.

Earlier, in a letter of 1958, Tolkien had said of the time between the
Fall of Barad-dûr and "our days" that: "I imagine the gap to be about
6000 years: that is we are now at the end of the Fifth Age, if the Ages
were of about the same length as S.A. and T.A. But they have, I think,
quickened; and I imagine we are actually at the end of the Sixth Age, or
in the Seventh" (L:283, fn).

Therefore, if Men entered Beleriand in Bel. 310, and the First Age ended
c. Bel. 600 (cf. XI:346), then that entrance occurred 290 + SA 3441 + TA
3021 = 6,752 years before the end of the Third Age. Assuming three
additional ages, plus 1,960 years of the 7^th^ Age as here, as having
occurred about 16,000 years prior, would yield an average duration of
the 4^th^ through 6^th^ Ages of: 16,000 -- 1,960 -- 6,752 = 7,288 ÷ 3 =
c. 2,430 years.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1082)

**31** As first written, this sentence read: "But this is not in fact
sufficient".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1083)

**32** Tolkien has marked the statement that the "the exact process \[of
the awaking of Men\] will *not* be disclosed or discussed in the
*Silmarillion*" as crucial by bracketing it in large asterisks. The
alternate year "1075" appears to have been a later addition, but in
black nib-pen; it agrees with the date given in B for the awaking of
Men.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1084)

**33** As first written, this sentence began: "The Quendi should then
awake at least \[1000 \>\>\] 10 VYs sooner: say, \[?950 \>\>\] 1050,
soon enough", before all between "at least" and "soon" was heavily
struck through.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1085)

**34** These figures reflect a "maturing" rate of 12 SYs to 1
Elven-year, and a rate from maturity to "prime" of 144 SYs to 1
Elven-year. Hence, at maturity, Elves would be between 18 and 24
Elven-years (i.e., 216 ÷ 12 = 18 Elven-years to 288 ÷ 12 = 24
Elven-years).

**15** Here a curious element enters the new scheme of the Great March:
sc., that *none* of the Eldar crossed the Misty Mountains (*Hithaeglir*)
into Eriador after crossing the Anduin, but instead the whole host (save
some 3,000 Nandor) turned south down the Anduin. In contrast, *The
Silmarillion* recounts (S:54, and cf. X:82--3 entry for YT 1115):

Now the Teleri abode long on the east bank of that river \[the Anduin\]
and wished to remain there, but the Vanyar and the Noldor passed over
it, and Oromë led them into the passes of the mountains \[the
Hithaeglir\].

and further that the Teleri too eventually passed over the mountains
(S:54):

And the host of the Teleri passed over the Misty Mountains, and crossed
the wide lands of Eriador.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1102)

**16** Originally, this sentence continued (before being struck
through):

but many go down to the Sea, at Isenmouth. Oromë eventually gets them to
go -- saying that they can dwell by the Sea long at their journeys' end,
and that the Valar want them to go northwards to

"Isenmouth" here must refer to the mouth of the River Isen/Angren (and
not the Carach Angren 'Jaws of Iron'/Isenmouthe of later Mordor; see
LR:920, 927--8). If so, this original continuation implies that in the
First Age the River Isen emptied into the Belegaer at or about the same
latitude and longitude that it does in the Third Age, despite the
submergence of vast amounts of the western lands of Beleriand in the War
of Wrath at the end of the First Age. The realization of this
implication of the passage no doubt occasioned its deletion in the act
of writing and the note that immediately follows.

**17** The last two sentences are additions in red ball-point pen, and

to have originally been 8,000, and the number of begetting pairs 4,000.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1104)

**18** Tolkien actually wrote "1131/9" here, but that is an error.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1105)

**19** Here again, in consequence of the southerly route the host takes
to avoid crossing the Misty Mountains and its subsequent passing through
the (later-named) gap of Rohan at the southern end of the mountains, the
host enters Beleriand below the southern end of the Ered Luin; whereas
in *The Silmarillion* the various bodies of the whole host cross over
the Ered Luin (at different times) at a much more northerly point (S:54,
and cf. X:83 entry for YT 1125):

At length the Vanyar and the Noldor came over Ered Luin, the Blue
Mountains, between Eriador and the westernmost land of Middle-earth,
which the Elves after named Beleriand; and the foremost companies passed
over the Vale of Sirion and came down to the shores of the Great Sea
between Drengist and the Bay of Balar ...

Thus after many years the Teleri also came at last over Ered Luin into
the eastern regions of Beleriand.

Accounts of the Great March prior to this give the impression that it
proceeded more-or-less straight from east to west at about the
mid-latitude of the Misty Mountains, and so much closer to the latitude
of Doriath. Given this new, more circuitous and much more southerly
route, it seems difficult to understand why, after entering Beleriand at
the southern end of the Ered Luin, the host would deviate so far north
as to reach the area of Doriath? As Oromë at least must have known, the
Bay of Balar directly to their west was much closer than the Falas or
Nevrast, and in the event became their point of departure from
Middle-earth to Valinor.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1106)

**20** Tolkien here actually wrote: "Say about 1132/17 they are in
Beleriand"; but since the (main) host entered Beleriand in VY 1132/12,
and since Tolkien next writes: "March is over", and then writes further
below that "Eldar reach coast in 1132/17", I have used the latter to
clarify what seems to be the actual intent here.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1107)

**21** Cf. X:81--3, where the Great Journey starts in YT 1105 and ends
in 1125. As Tolkien notes, in the scheme of the earlier "Tale of Years",
20 VY = 200 sun-years, not 2880 as here.

**22** Cf. X:101 n.1.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1109)

**23** Cf. X:84 §67, which assigns 1133 as the year when the Vanyar and
Noldor arrived in Aman. This is indeed 27 VY before the begetting of
Fëanor by Finwë and Míriel (but 36 VY before his birth), and so appears
to be what Tolkien is referring to here by "this".

**24** Draft material for this passage reads:

When Quendi were very "young in Arda", they were far more like Men
(unfallen), or indeed grown-up children. Their *hröar* (and the delights
of the body of all kinds) were dominant, and full of vigour; and their
*fëar* only beginning to grow and wake and discover their powers. So
they were far more progenitive and less exhausted by the production of
children.

Cf. the opening paragraph of the text presented in chap. V, "Natural
Youth and Growth of the Quendi", above. On the unfallen nature of the
Quendi, see T[HE]{.small} F[ALL OF]{.small} M[AN]{.small} in App. I.

### IX Time-scales and Rates of Growth {#ix-time-scales-and-rates-of-growth-1 .a-head-space-after}

**1** Tolkien at some later point wrote in the margin against this
paragraph in red ball-point pen: "*no quickening*"; and apparently at
the same time wrote in the space between the initial table and the first
paragraph: "*All this needs revision to duodecimal*", also in red
ball-point pen. This indicates that Tolkien had decided that the
Quendian growth-rate ought *not* in fact, as here, generally increase
outside of Aman from 144 (duodecimal) to 100 (decimal).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1125)

**2** There is no indication in the text of just when "these latter
days" are meant to be.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1126)

**3** As will be seen below, at the time of writing Tolkien still
regarded Aragorn as having died at age 190, not, as later, 210.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1127)

**4** In the c. 1951--2 "Tale of Years", as emended, Elrond and Elros
are said to have been born in YS 532 (XI:348), which makes him 58, as
here, when the First Age ended in YS 590 (XI:346).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1128)

**5** This is the year given in App. B in the first edition (1955) of
*The Return of the King*. This was changed to 109 in the second edition
(1966).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1129)

**6** Cf. LR:243.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1130)

**7** The words "and still at full vigour" were a later addition in red
ball-point pen.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1131)

**8** Both App. A and B to *The Lord of the Rings* say that while
Celebrían was attacked by Orcs and poisoned in TA 2509, she departed
over Sea in 2510 (LR:1043, 1087).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1132)

**9** Tolkien subsequently pencilled in -- but did not actually adopt
here -- alterations of various dates and consequent ages for Arwen
(changes that in part anticipate the scheme adopted in chap. XI, "Ageing
of Elves", below), thus suggesting that Arwen be born in TA 341 and so
2,678 sun-years old = 27 age-years at her marriage to Aragorn in TA
3019; that she was 2,610 or 26 when she met Aragorn in TA 2951.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1133)

**10** In the first edition (1955) of *RotK* App. B, Aragorn (born March
1, 2931) was said to have died on March 1, 1521, thus aged (exactly) 190
years, as here. In the second edition (1966) the year was altered to
1541, with Aragorn thus departing precisely at the age of 210 (which, it
may be noted, is precisely three times 70; cf. Psalm 89 \[90\] verse 10:
"The days of our life are seventy years, or perhaps eighty, if we are
strong").

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1134)

**11** As with Arwen's ages, Tolkien subsequently pencilled in -- but
did not adopt -- suggested changes, in this case to Aragorn's rate of
growth and consequent "normal" human equivalent ages (and similarly in
part anticipating the scheme adopted in chap. XI, "Ageing of Elves",
below) In the margin against this paragraph, Tolkien wrote:

Aragorn grew up \[to\] adult\[hood\] in \[the\] normal rate, he was
adult at 20. He then \[?endured\] at Númenórean rate of 3 : 1. So when
49 in \[sun-\]years he was 20 + 29/3 = about 30 in \[?fact\].

Tolkien then calculated Aragorn's ages on this 3 : 1 basis: so that he
was 20 + 68/3 = 43 at his wedding in TA 3019, and 20 + 170/3 = 77 at his
death in 4A 100.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1135)

**12** Tolkien elaborates on this matter in chaps. XI, "Lives of the
Númenóreans", and XII, "The Ageing of Númenóreans", in part three of
this book.

**13** In the c. 1950--1 "Grey Annals" the Siege of Angband is said to
have begun in YS 60 and to have been broken in YS 455 (XI:39, 52).

**14** For the problematic question of the history of Galadriel and
Celeborn in Tolkien's writings, before, within, and after the
publication of *The Lord of the Rings*, see Christopher Tolkien's
summary at UT:228 ff. The situation portrayed here agrees with what
little is said of the matter in App. B (LR:1082), though the account
here ascribes motives to Galadriel that App. B does not state
explicitly: both love and pride.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1138)

**15** Tolkien has made a mathematical error here: (3441 + 3021) = 6462
÷ 100 = 64.62 + 20 = 84.62 life-years.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1139)

**16** Tolkien here is apparently regarding the period of gestation as
equal to one life-year in Middle-earth, sc. 100 *löar*. But see the
later marginal note presented near the end of this text, it which he
corrects this to 8 *löar*. It remains, though, that even after the 1966
revisions to App. B, in which Elrond and Celebrían wed in TA 109 and the
twins are born in 130, 21 *löar* elapse between the events.

### X Difficulties in Chronology {#x-difficulties-in-chronology .a-head-space-after}

**1** The dates given here for the occupation of Gondolin (Bel. 116) and
of Tuor's coming to Gondolin (495) agree with those given in the *Grey
Annals* of c. 1951 (XI:44, 89, respectively).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1141)

**2** Regarding the (relatively late) arising (after c. 1951) of the
form of the name "Maeglin" (from prior "Meglin" and "Glindûr"), and the
still later substitution of "Aredhel" for "Isfin" see XI:48, 122--3
§§119--20, and 316.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1142)

**3** In the c. 1951 *Annals of Aman*, 5 VY elapse between the death of
the Two Trees in VY 1495 (X:98) and the first rising of the moon and sun
in VY 1500 (X:131), which coincided with the arrival in Middle-earth of
the Exiles that had crossed the Helkaraxë (XI:29--30).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1143)

**4** In chap. IV, "Time-scales", above (c. 1959), Anairë is said to
have been the Vanya wife of Turgon who "would not go with the Ñoldor
into exile". In all other published sources that name her, Anairë is the
wife of Fingolfin and thus Idril's grandmother, not mother (cf. XI:323,
XII:363).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1144)

**5** As first written the text from "in Aman was 50 = 1" continued
thus: "in early years after leaving Valinor: sc. 50 years from 1495 = 1
year of life. Thus Finduilas (cleaving to her father and brother) was
the youngest Exile, being only 12 in 1495. She then needed 8 years of
life to become 20, that is". These lines were then all struck out in the
act of writing and replaced with "in Beleriand".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1145)

**6** As originally written the rate began to increase for the Exiles as
soon as they left "the light of the Trees".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1146)

**7** I take this to mean that while crossing the Ice the Elvish rate of
ageing had increased from 144 = 1 in Aman to 72 = 1, thus adding 2
life-years in the 144 Sun-years it took to cross the ice. Upon arriving
in Middle-earth, this rate increased again to 50 = 1.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1147)

**8** If the rate in Beleriand was 50 = 1, then in the 122 years in
Beleriand lived after reaching 20 in Bel. 350, she should have aged in
Bel. 472 nearly 2½ life-years and been 22½. Similarly, in 490 she should
have aged a further ½ life year and been 23. I cannot explain this
discrepancy.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1148)

**9** In *The Lord of the Rings* it is said that "ere the fall of
Nargothrond or Gondolin \[Galadriel\] passed over the mountains" into
Eriador (LR:357). For the much-vexed history of Galadriel and Celeborn,
see UT:228ff.

**1** In the c. 1951 *Grey Annals*, Eöl "took \[Isfin, Maeglin's

(XI:47--8); and (as emended) Tuor came to Gondolin in Bel. 495, as here
(XI:91). That would make Maeglin 175 sun-years old at that time.

years, as here. In the second edition (1966) the year was altered to
1541, with Aragorn thus departing precisely at the age of 210.

Eärendil was not allowed to return to Middle-earth. The Half-elven /
since their mothers took on mortality at their wedding (or conception)
-- i.e. then aged at human rate / lived at human rate.

I have taken the slashes to be an indication that Tolkien considered
deleting the text between them, and since that passage is moreover an
incomplete thought, I have removed it editorially to render the passage
grammatical. I have also joined the passage on Eärendil to the
discussion that follows.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1162)

**12** As first written, this passage read:

and that this should extend to the third generation: thus Elrond : Arwen
: Eldarion and Elros : Vardamir : Tar-Amandil.

This appears to be the only suggestion in Tolkien's writings that
Vardamir was like Arwen among the Half-elven and so likewise had a
"choice of kindred".

Eldarion was mortal, so that his "long youth" was of modest scale: He
reached "maturity" at 60 and then lived another 65 years ...

**9** As previously mentioned, the cover/title page of this bundle is a
torn half-sheet. This sheet appears to have originally been the same
size and nature as the other sheets in this bundle, before being torn
roughly in half. The verso of the sheet demonstrates that it was in fact
extracted from a prior version of this text, as on it is written, in the
same hand and with the same ink and instrument as the rest of the
bundle, passages clearly related to this discussion of "the situation in
Aman":

\[The\] Elvish rate of life or 'ageing' (*coivië*) was the same as the
Valian, being designed to endure with Arda. No difference, therefore,
was discoverable in the process of the *coivië* of the Quendi in Aman.

But Aman had, inevitably, an effect on their *olmië* or process of
growth, which would be felt by all those not yet adult or entering it,
or later born there. In Aman, by the act of the Valar all living things,
such as beasts and plants, with corporeal forms were unaltered in these
forms, but used the Valian Year as the equivalent of 1 year in their
growth, natural to each kind. Thus a flower whose nature in Middle-earth
was to grow from a seed sown in the autumn, to appear in the next
spring, and reach its full

### XIII Key Dates {#xiii-key-dates .a-head-space-after}

**1** Tolkien altered this year from original "c. 600". The revised year
reflects a rate of 1 Valian Year = 144 sun-years (*löar*), thus FA 576 =
VY 854 -- VY 850 = VY 4 × 144 SY = SY 576 from FA 1.

**2** That the 12^th^ generation first appears in 576 implies an average
of 48 sun-years between the generations.

**3** Tolkien altered this date from original "c. 1200", This reflects a
calculation of FA 1152 = VY 858 -- VY 850 = VY 8 × 144 SY = SY 1152 from
FA 1.

**6** A passage later struck through in green ball-point pen originally
followed:

\[Ulmo \>\>\] Manwë decrees advice that ambassadors should be brought to

overaweing their wills by sight of splendour.

\*'Wild-beast-friend', *Palacendo* \*'Far-sight(ed)-one', *Haimenar*
\*'Far-farer'.

**8** The description of the election of the Three Ambassadors was
originally the end of the entry for DB 866/13 = FA 2175, where it was
preceded by a sentence stuck through in green ball-point pen:

Oromë (and Tulkas?) return, taking Three Ambassadors.

Tolkien indicated in green ball-point pen that the remainder of the
description should be moved to this entry instead, some 37 years later.

Finwë's response), but replaced it with "beauty" in the act of writing.

**10** A deleted final paragraph reads:

Imin looks up at the stars. He says, "I will remain if any of my folk
do". Tata and Enel say the same. In the end 2/3 decide to go. The
*Imillië* numbered about 2,625; the *Tatalië* 10,500; the *Enellië*
13,875. The greatest population of "Eldar" are from *Tatalië*.

whole paragraph and struck it through.

### XIV Calculation of the Increase of the Quendi {#xiv-calculation-of-the-increase-of-the-quendi-1 .a-head-space-after}

**1** Increasingly rough notes and calculations, found on the verso of
what is now the last of this small bundle of sheets, and subsequently
struck through in red ball-point pen, appear to be draft material for
what became the first scheme presented here:

*A better calculation*. First Elves produce the 2^nd^ gen. at once. It
begins therefore to appear in VY 1000/9, and only takes about VY 1/9 to
complete. All the 72 original pairs are wedded, and produce an average
of *6* children each.

The time at which the succeeding gen. begins to produce the next gen.
*steadily increases*: 1^st^ gen. at once (24), 2^nd^ gen. + 6 (30),
3^rd^ gen. + 6 (36) 4^th^ gen. + 6 (42), 5^th^ gen. + 6 (48), 6^th^
gen. + 6 (54). Average product wanes from 6 in first 3 gens. to 5 in
gen. 4, to 4 in gen. 5, to 3 thereafter (6 --). Also the proportion of
available pairs that actually wed is reduced: 1) the exactitude of
proportion of males and females is not maintained, 2) not all can find
mates, 3) various accidents. So that after the 1^st^ gen. the pairs will
be overestimated if the previous generation is divided by two. A
proportion increasing from 1% through to 10% must be deducted in each
generation.

Thus: First Elves. 2^nd^ gen. appears in VY 1000/9.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1196)

**2** As first written, the average was "V2/6 = 294 *löar*".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1197)

**3** The text originally continued as follows on the verso of the
sheet, before the whole side was subsequently struck through in black
ink:

This average V2/6 represents 294 *löar*, made up of 6 gestations = 54
*löar* + 240 *löar* representing five intervals of 48 *löar* for 5
births (60 for 4 births, 80 for 3 births, and 120 for 2 births).

1\) Average production of children per pair also decreases from 6 in
generations 1, 2, 3 \> 5 in gen. 4 \> 4 in gen. 5 \> 3 thereafter in
gen. 6 and subsequent gens. (at least up to arrival in Valinor).

2\) After the production by the First Elves and their "destined spouses"
of 2 generation the proportions of males and females varied (though
remaining never v. far from equality). Not all, however, could find
spouses; already a few did not desire them; and there were various
accidents and losses -- increasing when Sauron discovered their
dwellings. So that the wedded pairs cannot be found by dividing the
number of each generation by 2. A proportion beginning with 1% of 2 gen.
and increasing by 1% in each succeeding generation until 10% is reached,
must be deducted from the complete 100s of each generation before
division by 2.

If these factors are taken into account, we shall be able to calculate
with reasonable accuracy the increase of the Quendi from VY 1000 until
the Finding by Oromë in V \[Tolkien here leaves the date blank,
presumably pending further calculation\].

The First Generation or First Elves numbered 144. In V1001/90 they had
completed the 2 gen. which numbered 72 × 6 = 432. Pop. 576.

The Second Generation began to appear in V1000/9. It began production of
3 gen. after 30 years from that date. In a further V2/6 it had completed
the 3 gen. of 6 children per pair in V1000/39 +

The rejected text ends here, at the bottom of the page and mid-sentence.
There are however two marginal notes added in red ball-point pen that
read:

Time between first and last births of each generation therefore VY 2/6
-- 9 = 285 *löar* or VY 1/141.

If VY 2/6 is \[?needed\] for first birth to last birth for \[a\]
generation this will allow a small margin for \[*illegible*\].

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1198)

**4** In the event, as will be seen, the first table of generations
Tolkien produced following this statement actually shows 6 children per
pair for generations 1 through 4, 5 in the 5^th^ gen., 4 in the 6^th^
gen. and 3 in the 7^th^ gen.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1199)

**5** The clause "or any other date decided upon" is an addition in red
ball-point pen, as is the tabular footnote of intervals.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1200)

**6** The population column was an addition in pencil. Beside the 2^nd^,
3^rd^, and 4^th^ gen. entries, in the left margin, Tolkien later wrote
in red ball-point: "865/9 866/90", "873/18 876/99", and "887/27
892/108", respectively, apparently the dates of first and last births of
those generations in a revised chronology where the Elves awake in FA
865.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1201)

**7** This paragraph entered as a marginal note written in red
ball-point pen.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1202)

**8** It is unclear where Tolkien's figure of 850 years comes from. In
*The Annals of Aman* of the early 1950s, the Elves awoke at Kuiviénen in
VY 1050, and Oromë discovered them there in VY 1085 (X:71--2), which
means they were left unguarded for 35 VY, which in the scheme in effect
at that time was 350 sun-years. Tolkien may have forgotten that at that
time the Elves did not awake in VY 1000.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1203)

**9** Tolkien here actually wrote "1388/84 + 2 VY + VY 2/84 = 1392/24",
but this is an error. The correct total is 1392/168 = 1393/24, which I
have provided. Similarly, I have corrected the subsequent calculation
from "VY 1392/24 + VY 2 + VY 2/84 = 1396/108".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1204)

**10** This figure derives from the original number of children Tolkien
assigned to each pair, 11, multiplied by the number of pairs, 430, and
the corresponding increase of 4,730. Tolkien later changed the number of
children to 12 (in accordance with the number born to each pair in the
1^st^ and 3^rd^ generations) and revised the increase to 5,160, but he
did not revise the figure for the total population. However, he
nonetheless used the new increase of 5,160 to derive the number of pairs
in the 3^rd^ gen., sc. 2,580. I have therefore let the mathematical
error stand, to show the intended scheme, even though the numbers do not
add up.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1205)

**11** I cannot account for the fact that immediately following this
statement (which begins a new page but is not evidently a marginal
note), Tolkien presents a new scheme in which the Quendi are in fact
much more "prolific and precipitate" in producing offspring.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1206)

**12** The total gestations + intervals time of VY 2/18 (= 306 years)
here is inconsistent with a reduction of the number of children born to
each married pair, even with the increase of the individual interval
from birth to next conception to 18 years. Since there is an average of
11 offspring of the 3^rd^ gen. for each married 2^nd^-gen. pair, the
total time of gestations should be 11 × 9 = 99 years, and the total time
of intervals should be 10 × 18 = 180 years, for a total span from first
conception to last birth of 279 years = VY 1/135. It appears that
Tolkien has instead calculated the times as 12 gestations × 9 (= 108) +
11 intervals × 18 (= 198) = 306. It may be that Tolkien had not yet
settled on the reduced number of children per pair in the 2^nd^--4^th^
generations when he made these calculations; but there is no indication
that the calculations of increase were a later insertion.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1207)

**13** Similarly, the figure of VY 2/84 (= 372 years) here and in the
4^th^ gen. seems to be a calculation based on 12 gestations × 9 (=
108) + 11 intervals × 24 (= 264) = 372.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1208)

**14** In both cases "VY 3" as the time to maturity was altered by
Tolkien from "VY 2", and in the first case the correction was
underscored in red ball-point pen.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1209)

**15** Tolkien here actually started the generations from 1, not 2; but
in doing so he must have meant generations after the First Elves (who
strictly speaking were not "generated" in the womb). I have altered the
generation numbering to accord with that which Tolkien used everywhere
else, to avoid confusion.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1210)

**16** Tolkien miscalculated the total population of the 2^nd^ gen. as
572 (it should be 144 + 432 = 576), and carried this error through the
rest of his population tally. I have corrected this error throughout.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1211)

**17** Tolkien here miscalculated 13,100 × 5 as 75,500, and thus the
total as 120,634. I have corrected the error.

About the 5^th^ generation Tolkien actually wrote "5⁄₆ @ 5\[^th^

appears to be that the average number drops by about one third in
generations succeeding the first two.

But the *Onnalúmë* of the First Elves was only 54 \[sun-years\]:
intervals 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 = 52 + 2 = 54. This was the *Onnalúmë*
of the First Elves with 9 children, 2^nd^ Elves, Third. The 4^th^
generation produced only 6, and this remained usual average for three
generations, before falling successively to 5, 4 where it long remained.
*Onnalúmë* of the 6^th^ gen. was intervals of 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 = 90 + 6
= 96. *Onnalúmë* of the 5^th^ gen.: 12, 21, 30, 39 = 102 + 5 = 107.
*Onnalúmë* of the 4^th^ gen.: 24, 36, 48 = 108 \[+ 4 =\] 112.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1225)

**12** Tolkien actually started this sentence with: "But the Finding
should be (as above) not till VY 864", but since the only other texts in
the "Time & Ageing" bundle that place the Finding in VY 864 are the
generational tables that immediately *follow* this text in the bundle, I
have removed the likely confusing direction.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1226)

**13** It is unclear to what "Older Scheme" Tolkien is here referring.
In the *Annals of Aman*, the Eldar do not start on the Great March until
VY 1105 (X:81--2). It may be noted however that in text A of chap. VII,
"The Awaking of the Quendi", above, Melkor is said to have discovered
Men in VY 1080, which was 10 VY before the Valar opened their attack on
Melkor.

**15** The father of Ingwë is nowhere else named (and is of course not
found in *The Silmarillion* because he was there one of the First Elves
and so had no parents), nor is his spouse, nor is he elsewhere than this
bundle of texts identified as the father of Indis. In other somewhat
contemporary sources Indis is said variously to be Ingwë's sister
(X:261--2) or niece (XII:343; and cf. XII:365). Also, in other and
earlier sources, the son of Ingwë is named *Ingwiel* (cf. V:144, 326).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1230)

**17** 990 here is an error for 1000. I have not corrected it, however,
because of the additional error introduced in the 4^th^ generation.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1231)

**18** 433 is an error for 423 (846 ÷ 2) and thus the number of married
pairs, 428, is higher than it should be (c. 419), but Tolkien did not
catch the mistake, and so all succeeding population numbers are higher
than they should be (about 1,350 too high at the 29^th^ generation).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1232)

**19** This is another miscalculation: 6,900 + 1,236 is 8,136, not
7,136; but Tolkien has carried this through the rest of the generations.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1233)

**20** This is yet another miscalculation: 10,772 + 1,188 is 11,960, not
12,160. This does however balance out the previous miscalculation.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1234)

**21** Tolkien has here miscalculated the year of first marriage as 1160
(and thus the year of first birth as 1161). The correct number (the year
of the first birth of the preceding generation, plus the age at
marriage) is 1164 + 96 = 1260. Tolkien has carried this error through
all subsequent generations, thus miscalculating all the subsequent years
of first marriages and first births. As Tolkien subsequently refers to
and makes calculations with these erroneous figures, I have let them
stand. The correct years of first marriages and first births for
generations 21--29 should be:

**22** See the previous editorial note. Tolkien's estimate of pre-March
births are too high, if strictly determined by dividing the span of each
date-range by the stated interval: by 2 or perhaps even 3 in generation
25 (intervals of 49), and by 1 or 2 in the subsequent generations
(intervals of 51 and 61).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1236)

**23** Tolkien here in fact wrote that "at the Finding they were 24 +
2011 in *age*", but I have altered this to avoid the confusion of the
two different ages cited in this sentence, in which the first refers to
age in sun-years but the second to age in Elvish life-years.

footnote was supplied:

Morgoth fought with a great hammer, Grond, that he wielded as a mace,
and Fingolfin with Ringil. Swift was Fingolfin, and avoiding the strokes
of Grond, so that Morgoth smote but the ground (and \[at\] each stroke a
great pit was made), he gave Morgoth seven wounds with his sword, and
the cries of Morgoth echoed in the Northlands. \[*to be inserted after*

and filled the pits of Grond. Then Morgoth lifted the body and would
cast it to the wolves \[*to be inserted at the end of the text*\]

indication that it is to be inserted here (but see XI:56):

Great wolves \[?assailed\] Rochallor and he escaped only because of his
swiftness, and ran to Hithlum and there died.

**2** An apparently contemporary typescript note among Tolkien's
linguistic papers reads:

CE \**khōn-*, *khond-* was only used of the physical heart, and that was
not regarded as or supposed to be a centre of either emotion or thought.
Thus when Treebeard uses the adjectives *morimaitë*, *sincahonda*
'black-handed, flint-hearted' of the Orks, these were both physical in
reference -- as indeed were all the other adjectives, whatever they may
have implied with regard to Orkish minds and characters. *Sincahonda*
referred to their immense staying power in exertion, marching, running,
or climbing, which gave rise to the jesting assertion that their hearts
must have been made of some exceedingly hard substance; it did not mean
pitiless. The last adjective 'blood-thirsty' (*serkilixa*) was also
literal: the Orks actually drank the blood of their victims. A compound
of similar kind meaning 'hard-hearted, pitiless', would have been in
Quenya *ondórëa*.

**4** Tolkien did not originally conceive of the Elves as ambidexters.
The earliest *Qenya* and *Gnomish* *Lexicons* explicitly portray the
left hand as clumsy, the right as skilful: Q. *lenka* 'slow, dull,
stiff; left (hand)' and *malenka* 'lefthand, -ed', G. *gôg* 'clumsy;
left (hand)'. Predominance of the right hand is still evident in the
later *Etymologies*, which includes Q. *formaite* 'righthanded,
dexterous'. It is also implicit in the story of Maedhros, who after
losing his right hand in his rescue by Fingon from Thangorodrim "lived
to wield his sword with left hand more deadly than his right had been"
(V:252). Even in the latest version of this story in the *Grey Annals*
(written in the early 1950s), which simply notes that "Thereafter
Maidros wielded his sword in his left hand" (XI:32), the mere fact that
this is mentioned implies that the feat was somehow noteworthy or
unusual.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1282)

**5** Tolkien himself made a few attempts at this practice of writing
from right to left in mirror-image *tengwar*. Two examples are
reproduced here:

::: section-symbol-break-page-end
![Image](images/000003.jpg){.calibre31}
:::

The first reads *Mordor* while the second is *Tindómrl* (i.e.,
*Tindómerel*). The shakiness of Tolkien's penmanship indicates that he
probably wrote these *tengwar* inscriptions with his left hand.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1284)

*tengwar* 17 *númen* 'west', 33 *hyarmen* 'south', 25 *rómen* 'east',
and 10 *formen* 'north' "commonly indicated the points W, S, E, N even
in languages that used quite different terms. They were, in the
West-lands, named in this order, beginning with and facing west;
*hyarmen* and *formen* indeed meant left-hand region and right-hand
region (the opposite to the arrangement in many Mannish languages)"
(LR:1123).

**8** This note is of interest as showing that the scheme that Tolkien
eventually arrived at in the "Time and Ageing" papers, whereby Elves
matured only somewhat more slowly than Men, persisted to at least the
final years of the 1960s. Cf. chap. XV, "Note on the Youth and Growth of
the Quendi", of c. 1959 in part one of this book, where Elvish gestation
occupies one sun-year and growth proceeds at the same rate as Men until
maturity is reached at 24 sun-years; but cf. also chap. XVIII, "Elvish
Ages & Númenórean" of 1965, also in part one, where the gestation is 3
sun-years and growth until maturity occurs at a rate of 3 : 1 sun-years
compared to Men.

"Elves did not have beards until they entered their third cycle of life.
Nerdanel's father \[cf. XII:365--6 n.61\] was exceptional, being only
early in his second." And in any event, in *The Lord of the Rings* it is

### VIII Knowledge and Memory {#viii-knowledge-and-memory-1 .a-head-space-after}

**1** The sense Tolkien here gives to *feign* harkens back (according to
the *OED*) to a previous, primary and material sense (now obsolete) 'to
fashion, form, shape'. This sense derives from Middle English, Old
French, and ultimately from Latin *fingere* 'to form, mould, feign',
whence both *fiction* and *figment*.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1310)

**2** Cf. the invocations of Varda (using her Sindarin name, Elbereth)
by Frodo on Weathertop (LR:195) and Sam in Cirith Ungol (LR:729). For
more on the nature of and constraints on contact between minds, see the
next chapter.

passage beginning with "But it is not *complete*", in red ball-point
pen, and wrote: "No! If they would take up *life* they *must* take up
*memory* again".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1315)

**7** At a later time, again in red ball-point pen, Tolkien altered
"*hrondo*" here to "*hröa*". There is no independent evidence that the
word *hröa* for 'body' was in use until after the typescript text B of
*Laws and Customs among the Eldar* was made in c. 1958 (see X:141--3,
209, 304).

**8** See, e.g., the numerous examples in *Morgoth's Ring*, and

speech and memory as here.

### IX *Ósanwe-kenta* {#ix-ósanwe-kenta-1 .a-head-space-after}

**1** It is of course tempting to identify this redactor, and that of
*Quendi and Eldar*, as Ælfwine, the Anglo-Saxon mariner who was the
translator/transmitter of and commentator upon other works of Pengolodh,
such as the *Quenta Silmarillion* (V:201, 203--4, 275 fn.) and, notably,
*Lhammas B* (cf. V:167).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1318)

**2** While Pengolodh's *Lammas* 'Account of Tongues' here is, within
the sub-creation, the same work as his *Lhammas* (the text published in
*The Lost Road*), it appears that it refers to an unwritten (or, at any
rate, no longer extant) version of that work that differs in certain
respects. The published *Lhammas*, for instance, does not end with a
discussion of "direct thought-transmission", as the present text states
of the *Lammas*; and the *Note on the "Language of the Valar"* that
concludes *Quendi and Eldar*, said to be "summarized" from Pengolodh's
comments at the beginning of his *Lammas* (XI:397), is very much longer
and more detailed than the very brief, general statement that begins the
*Lhammas* (V:168). (At least one contemporary reference to the *Lammas*
may, however, have been to the extant *Lhammas*: see XI:208--9 n. §6.)

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1319)

**3** A note on one of the title pages of *Quendi and Eldar* indicates
that the *Ósanwe-kenta* was intended by Tolkien as an adjunct to the
longer essay: "To which is added an abbreviation of the *Ósanwe-kenta*
or 'Communication of Thought'" (X:415). Furthermore, Christopher Tolkien
notes that his father used the title *Quendi and Eldar* not only for the
longer essay, but also to include the *Ósanwe-kenta* and another brief
essay on the origin of Orcs (the latter published in *Morgoth's Ring*,
cf. pp. 415 ff.). All three essays are extant in typescript versions
that are "identical in general appearance" (X:415).

The association of the *Ósanwe-kenta* with *Quendi and Eldar* also
extends to terminology and subject matter. For example, the
*Ósanwe-kenta* employs certain linguistic terms defined and discussed in
some detail in *Quendi and Eldar* (e.g. *tengwesta*, *lambë*) in a
manner that assumes that the definitions and distinctions given there
are already known. Further, the *Ósanwe-kenta* amplifies certain
statements in the *Note on the 'Language of the Valar'* that concludes
*Quendi and Eldar*: e.g. that "It was the special talent of the
Incarnate, who lived by *necessary* union of *hröa* and *fëa*, to make
language" (XI:405); and, more strikingly, that "the Valar and Maiar
could transmit and receive thought directly (by the will of both
parties) according to their right nature", although their "use of bodily
form ... made this mode of communication less swift and precise"
(XI:406). It likewise amplifies upon "the speed with which ... a
*tengwesta* may be learned by a higher order", by the aid of direct
"transmission and reception of thought" in conjunction with "warmth of
heart" and "desire to understand others", as exemplified by the
quickness with which Finrod learned the Bëorian language (*ibid*.)

In its remarkable natural and moral philosophical range, the
*Ósanwe-kenta* also has strong affinities with other, similarly
philosophical, and closely contemporary writings published in *Morgoth's
Ring*: e.g. *Laws and Customs among the Eldar*, the *Athrabeth Finrod ah
Andreth*, and many of the briefer writings collected in Part V, "Myths
Transformed". Of these, of particular note in connection with the
present essay are texts II (X:375 ff.), VI *Melkor Morgoth* (X:390 ff.),
and VII *Notes on motives in the Silmarillion* (X:394 ff.), all in some
manner concerned with the motives and methods of Melkor and his dealings
with Manwë and the other Valar and the Incarnates. The beginning of part
(ii) of this last text (X:398 ff.) is especially noteworthy; though very
much briefer and less detailed than the *Ósanwe-kenta*, it is also
concerned with "thought-transference" and with many of the same
philosophical issues surrounding it as are discussed in the present
text.

**9** This is perhaps a reference to the c. 1925--31 *Lay of Leithian*
(cf. III:252--4, ll.2740--2822), where it is said that Sauron (then
called Thû) escaped from Huan as "A vampire shape with pinions vast",
though leaving behind "a wolvish corpse". In the published
*Silmarillion* (S:175), however, it is plain that Sauron yields to
Lúthien and is let loose by Huan *in order to avoid* his bodily
destruction.

purposes, criminal.

**13** With this discussion of Melkor's deceitful methods of winning
entry through the door of the *sáma*, it is interesting to compare the
contemporary depiction of his failed attempt to cozen, flatter, and
entice Fëanor into allowing him to enter through the (physical) door of
Formenos, in the second-phase expansion of the *Quenta Silmarillion*
chapter "Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor" (X:280 §54, also

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1337)

**7** In apparently closely contemporary writings (i.e., c. Jan. 1968)
elsewhere in Tolkien's papers, the verbal base √NID is glossed 'force,
press(ure), thrust'. Among the Quenya derivatives given there are the
noun *indo* 'the mind in its purposing faculty, the will', and the verb
*nirin* 'I press, thrust, force (in a given direction)', which "though
applicable to the pressure of a person on others, by mind and 'will' as
well as by physical strength, could also be used of physical pressures
exerted by inanimates".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1338)

**8** In the top margin of the page, above these glosses, is an
exceedingly difficult note, which so far as I am able to make out reads:
"*hóre* also the conscience. The inner or inherent knowledge of what was

**1** The query mark is Tolkien's own. The symbol "\>" is commonly used
in linguistics to mean "yielded", either in form (by phonological
development) or meaning (by semantic variation). Here the meaning is
that from the basic sense 'settle, establish' arose the sense 'to erect
permanent buildings or dwellings'.

**5** This paragraph, interpolated from the first version of the note,
continues with a partial sentence: "Ambar is complex enough, but only
Eru who made and designed both Ambar (the processes of Eä)". Tolkien
interrupted the sentence at this point to provide an etymological note
on Eä, which reads: "*Eä* 'it is' only = the total of Ambar: the given
material and its processes of change. Outside Eä is the world/sphere of
aware purpose and will". This was followed at the bottom of the page by
an etymological note on the Quenya word for 'will':

?DEL: Q. *lēle*, v\[erb\] *lelya* (*lelinye*): To *will* with conscious
purpose, immediate or remote. To be willing, to assent, consent, agree
-- quite different, for it partakes of *will* but is an additional
\[?accident\]. A man may say "I \[?wish\], I agree, I will" to some
proposition of another without special purpose of his own (but he may
also have reflected that it fits in with some design of his own and so
agree to it as he might not otherwise have done).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1350)

**6** The apparent ascription to Eru here of less than complete
foreknowledge of the Music and the resulting Tale, in apparent
contradiction of the absolute omniscience ascribed to God in both
Catholic and classical theistic thought, may help explain the apparently
hesitant nature of this roughly and faintly written addition. In any
event, as Tolkien wrote before applying the simile of an author of a
tale to Eru, it is "only a likeness ... the nearest experience of the
Incarnates to this problem".

be replaced by following *etsurinye* in light of *surinye* in the
subsequent jottings (q.v.). Similarly, "*Eldaron indor*" replaced the

Sea. For their bodies were self-made. They houseless as spirits could go
where they would (either slowly or immediately), and could then reclothe
themselves. In Middle-earth they usually occluded their radiance.

fit to be reborn, if they desire it ye shall \[?name\] to Me, and they
must then await My will. I shall consider them and understand clearly
what they incur.

Tolkien then typed an alternative to this paragraph, subsequently struck
through:

Eru answered: "It is in your power; but ye shall have authority to
choose from among those who desire it the *fëar* for whom re-birth is
fitting, but ye find any that desire re-birth, ye shall instruct them,
and if when they learn all that is entailed they still desire it, they

material and its "virtues and effects", cf. "The Primal Impulse"
(below), and cf. H[YLOMORPHISM]{.small} in App. I. Noting that *únehtar*
are, it appears, quite literally "atoms" (i.e., 'indivisible things'),
the discussion of minute and rare variations of the *únehtar* of a
*nassë* (material) is highly reminiscent of the phenomenon of isotopes
of elements, as for example deuterium (^2^H) of hydrogen. The form
"*únehtar*" replaces earlier "*únexi*" (of the same apparently literal
meaning, but with nominal rather than deverbal derivation).

**1** The exception is a typed, undated letter from one Andrew
Cruickshank, advertising and raising funds for the Wordsworth Ryland
Mount Trust, Ltd. This charity, registered in the U.K. on 6 Feb. 1970
(now dissolved), had as its aim: "To promote, encourage, maintain,
improve and advance public education and in particular the education of
the public in the life and work of William Wordsworth and to establish
and maintain a museum to house and preserve all such articles and
effects of literary and other nature having connection with William
Wordsworth or his family."

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1400)

**2** In the margin against this Tolkien wrote the word "fwyn", which
may be intended as representing the pronunciation of the Sindarin word
*fuin* according to the conventions of Welsh orthography (though if so
the spelling ought rather to be "ffwyn"). As first written, √PHUY had
the start of a gloss: "prob. 'fog, mists', produced", struck through in
the act of writing.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1401)

**3** An apparent candidate replacement for the conception of night as a
"breath" follows Tolkien's diagram in a very hasty hand:

as a wind that followed the Sun out of the East and drove its light away
West (which \[?alike\] they conceived as a substance like ethereal
liquid that otherwise \[?would flow down\] like a tenuous rain on the
surface of Arda and in pools, as they imagined it to do in Aman) where
the Sun carries it back again leaving Earth \[????\] of the Sun
\[?flowed\] or spread her light over Arda until it again \[?drives it
off\] Arda.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1402)

**4** In the margin, against the accompanying figure, Tolkien later
wrote, in pencil: "*linque* = liquid light".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1403)

**5** A note written in the top margin of this page adds: "'darkness'
conceived as a very thin misty substance had the ancient name of
\**phuinē* (√PHUY 'breathe out'); 'light' conceived also as a very
ethereal but shining substance had the ancient name of \**linkwē* (√LIK
'glide, slip')".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1404)

**6** For the late (c. 1959) but obviously long-lived extension of the
term *Arda* to encompass the entire solar system (not just the Earth, as
earlier), cf. X:337, 349, 358 n.11, and esp. 375.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1405)

**7** Tolkien "translated" the language of the Rohirrim into Old
English, so here "Rohanese" (R) in fact stands for Old English (O.E.).
The "Story of Eärnil" is apparently a reference to Eärnil II, the 32nd
King of Gondor, and what is said of him in various parts of App. A of
*LR*, though in fact the name *Limlight* does not there occur in
connection with these passages. It may be that "Eärnil" here is a slip
for *Eorl*, in which case see LR:1064.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1406)

**8** O.E. *ēa* 'river' is a common element in English river-names,
frequently as an ending becoming -*ey*. As first written, the original
Sindarin name was "*Lim(p)-hir*".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1407)

**9** A marginal note against this reads: "In that case it is possible
(though unlikely?) that *līht* in R. had sense *levis*" (i.e., as Latin
*levis* adj. 'light (not heavy)'). At the end of the text, Tolkien
further notes that "\[?Older\] Rohanese had a voiceless initial *lh*,
but in both Sindarin and R. this may have been voiced, or dissimilative
for *mh*".

An earlier version of this possible derivation reads: "S. *limb* \>
*lim(m)* was from C.E. *limbi* 'smooth, sleek, sliding, gliding
(slippery)', applied among other things to fish, snakes, light boats
\[?but\] \[of\] shallow draught, waters or liquids flowing (down) or
slipping along \[? or?\]. But this would not have been interpreted by R.
*līht* 'light' (lucent), and is not close to R. *līht* '*levis*'. It
seems probable that the old name was actually \< S. *limp*".

### II The Primal Impulse {#ii-the-primal-impulse .a-head-space-after}

**1** Text A originally gives this Quenya name of the "Great Pattern" as
*Arkantië*, subsequently emended to *Erkantië.* In B it was first
written as *erkantië* and then capitalized. It was written as *Erkantië*
at its second occurrence.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1409)

**2** The draft as first written has to this point: "the total unfolding
of which is the Great Pattern. The whole life of this may not indeed be
coextensive with the life of Arda". This was emended to replace "may"
with "will", and "life of Arda" with "Tale of Arda".

before it has begotten or born any seed, or offspring, or heir".

**7** Text A reads here: "But the whole will not cease, until such time
as no single living thing produces living offspring". Also in text A the
passage corresponding to that here from "Yet while it continues" to this
point originally followed the passage corresponding to what is the third
paragraph in text B, beginning "But others hold". In A this passage
entered as an interpolation, with an arrow indicating that it was to be
inserted before the passage corresponding to the third paragraph in text
B.

The corresponding passage in the draft, which as in text A follows the
passage corresponding to what is the third paragraph in text B, is brief
and different enough (chiefly in metaphor) to give here in full:

This \[the *Ermenië*\] continues through the ages in continuity. For
though some branches occasionally may wither and end as some rivulets
run into sand and clay and come not to the Sea. And that is when living
creatures perish before they have begotten or born or produced seed or
offspring or heir.

the text given as chap. XVII, "Death", in part two of this book.

**9** As suggested by the Eldarin base √MEN- 'have as object, (in)tend,
proceed, make for, go towards' PE17:93) and its derivative \**mēnie*
'determination' (PE17:94), Tolkien apparently uses "device" here not
only in the modern sense given it in the *OED* as "6 Something devised
or contrived for bringing about some end or result"; but also in one or
both senses (now considered obsolete) given it in the *OED* as: "†2
Purpose, intention" and "3 †b. Will or desire as expressed or conveyed
to another; command, order, direction, appointment".

struck out all from "a matter" to "Him", before continuing the effort on
the next page with "a matter ...". Further, in the left margin against
this lengthy paragraph he very roughly wrote: "Debate concerning Manwë's

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1477)

**8** On an adjacent sheet -- bearing the same title and likewise in
typescript -- occurs a different version of this opening paragraph and
etymological discussion:

The name *Galadriel* is in this form Sindarin. Its original meaning was
'lady of the glittering coronal', referring to the brilliant sheen of
her golden hair, which in her youth she wore in three long braids, the
middle one being wound about her head. *Celeborn* is also in this form
Sindarin, but originally meant 'silver-tall'. Both names were, however,
originally Telerin: *Alatáriel* and *Teleporno*. This may seem strange,
since Galadriel was of the Noldor, the sister of Finrod son of Finarphin
son of Finwë, and one of the greatest of that House; but it may be
understood by reference to the *Tale of Celeborn and Galadriel*.

*Galadriel* was formed from the base ÑAL 'shine, glitter', applied to
light reflected from water, metal, glass, gems, etc. From this was
derived a triconsonantal form \**ñalata* '(reflected) radiance'. The
base *RIȜ* meant 'wind about, wreathe'; derivatives were \**riȝ* 'a
wreath, garland' (Q. *ría* also *ríma* 'fillet, snood'). The suffix
-*el*, *-elle* (developed in C.E.) was a feminine ending, parallel to
the masculine *-on*, *ondo*; a \**riȝel(le)* was a woman bearing a
garland on her head, usually applied to maidens wearing garlands of
flowers at festivals. \**ñalata-riȝell*e would this mean 'maiden crowned
with a garland of radiance'. The name was given to her by Teleporno, and
accepted by her.

Galadriel was a daughter of Finarphin son of Finwë first king of the
Noldor. She was called *Nerwen* 'man-maiden' because of her strength and
stature, and her courage. She loved to wander far from the home of her
kin.

Following this are some roughly handwritten etymological notes in ink:

Q *ñal* obsolete except in *ñalda* 'bright, polished' (of metal).
*angal* (\[?\] \**aŋŋala*) 'a mirror' or *angalailin* 'mirrormere'.
\**ŋalatā-rīȝel(le)* = *Alatáriel*. Quenyarized *Altáriel*? RGEO
*Altariello* gen.

The reference to "RGEO" is to the 1968 song-book *The Road Goes Ever
On*, in which the poem *Namárië* is described by Tolkien in Quenya as
"*Altariello nainië Lóriendessë*", i.e. 'Galadriel's lament in Lórien".

Finally, some related draft notes read:

*Galadriel* was a Sindarin name given to (and accepted by) her after her
coming to Beleriand, meaning 'lady of the golden crown' or 'coronal',
referring to the braids of her golden hair (braided high).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1478)

**9** Tolkien corrected original *Angal-mille* to *Angal-limpe* in ink.
In connection with the Eldarin words for 'mirror', this is a convenient
place to cite a passage in separate but contemporary writings among
Tolkien's linguistic papers concerning an object of Elvish technology:

\[Q.\] *ñaltalma*, the name of an Eldarin device for signalling from
afar (like a heliograph, though it is said to have been also usable in a
clear moon). Its form and the manner of manipulating it are not
recorded, but it must have contained a bright surface. It was however
evidently small, able to be slipped into a slender pouch or pocket, and
the flash that it gave would not have been visible by human eyes, at any
rate not at a distance. In what way the flashes, received by a watcher
when suitably directed, conveyed a message is also now unknown. The
*ñaltalma* was, as most such things, in later days attributed to Fëanor;
but was probably far older. (Similar devices were used by the Sindar,
and there is no mention of their being among the many things learned by
the Sindar from the Exiles). The Sindarin name was *glathralvas*
'flashing glass/crystal'.

The heliograph, a mirrored signalling device (usually employing Morse
code), was a standard device in the British Army from the 19th century
through 1960. Tolkien, who trained in military signalling in 1914--15
and became Battalion Signalling Officer in 1916 (TCG I:62, 92), would
have been well familiar with the device. The manual he was issued during
his training, *Signalling: Morse*, *Semaphore*, *Station Work*,
*Despatch Riding*, *Telephone Cables*, *Map Reading* (ed. E.J. Solano,
1915; see TCG I:79) says of the heliograph (p. 6) that: "In the case of
flag or lamp signals the distance is usually less in broken or hilly
ground and misty atmosphere, and greater on level ground and in clear
atmosphere. In India, Africa, and Egypt, for instance, upon hilly
ground, stations for signalling by heliograph may be separated by
seventy miles or more. On the other hand, in Britain and other European
countries it may not be possible to use the heliograph at all, owing to
want of sunlight, and its range is usually limited to twenty-five miles
in sunshine, owing to the prevalence of mist and haze in the
atmosphere."

**10** As typed, this sentence ended: "... Celeborn, which actually
contained a tree-word"; it was altered to the given reading via a
marginal note in ball-point pen.

**11** As first typed the text here continued: "No doubt the same
association was made by its people, but *galad* was the form they gave
to the S. word *galað* 'tree'. They spoke Sindarin, and some among them
were actually Sindar; but their daily language was modified by their
former tongue. This had not preserved the sounds *ð* and *þ* and these
were turned into *d* and *s*." This passage was subsequently struck
through in ink.

**14** The continuation "and alterations of it ..." after "based on
*lawarind*" arose in very rough writing on the page, in ink and in-line
with the text and interposing the resumption of the typescript. This
first version reads:

and alterations of it to resemble names of Valinor for which, as is
plain, Galadriel's longing increased year by year to at last an
overwhelming regret. Lórien was the name most used in the Third Age,
since formally it could also be a Sindarin name \[*deleted*: though in
Sindarin it would more properly be spelt *Lorien* since in Sindarin the
\[?quantity augmented? only\] an\]

The point of the deleted passage seems to be that the *o* of the
Sindarin reflex of \**lawarind* would not be marked as long, since (in
accordance with usual Sindarin development) it arose from earlier
\**aw*(*a*) by (in this position) monophthongization and shortening.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1484)

**15** The footnote on \**tumbu* here was subject to much emendation and
reconsideration. As first typed, the form appears to have been
\**tumbā*, and Q. *iTumbo* (and *i Tumbo*) was emended in ink from
original *iTumba* (and *i Tumba*); and *Tum Orchorod* is a replacement
for original *Tum Orodgerth*. A rough note in ink above this note,
apparently referring to Rivendell (S. *Imladris*) reads: "Cf. \**imbē* a
variation of \**imbi* 'between', now used of a cleft of great length in
mountains between very high walls of stone; Q. *imbilat* = S. *imlad*)".
A rough note in ink below this note reads: "No. t*umbŭ* = deep of vale,
v\[ale?\] referred to the great volcanic mare in midst of the
crater-valley." (It is possible for "mare" to be read as "mere", but the
former's use for dark, flat pseudo-oceans of ancient, hardened volcanic
flow seems more apposite.) This consideration of the Vale of Gondolin in
turn gave rise to still another rough note in ink, filling the bottom
half of the page, on the name, history, and nature of Gondolin:

Gondolin. Q. Ondolinde 'Singing Stone' \[??\]

That the site had been occupied by Dwarves meant \[?first\] who had done
much of the work -- bringing the stones and leveling the land and
building the walls of the central fortress -- \[?which by?? only rea?
by?\]. It was the Noldor who \[???\] built a \[?steel\] bridge from the
outer shore of the lake across the \[??\] of the lake to the \[??\].
\[?????\] of the return of Morgoth to Thangorodrim and Turgon had found
the Tumbo deserted. The name *Gondolin* in Sindarin \[?\] Gondolin(d) is
probably \[???\] Quenya \[?????\] before \[?\] foundation. Though
somewhere supposed \[??\] to have been Eldarized from some older
Dwarvish \[?name but???\] contact!

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1485)

**16** A later, rough marginal note in ink here reads: "A genitival a of
relationship, pl. *-on*, occurred in O.S., but only preserved in names
of the \[? or?\]. *Dagnir Laurunga*." With this latter name, cf. the
epitaph *Dagnir Glaurunga* \*'Slayer of Glaurung' on Túrin's grave
marker (S:226, UT:145). An etymological figure in ink on the following
page shows the development of this genitival ending in Old Sindarin,
accounting for the preservation of word-final -*a* where the normal loss
of all final syllables makes final vowels uncommon in Sindarin:

\*-*āga*, \[pl.\] *āgam* \> *![ā\~](images/000037.jpg){.middle}*,
*![ā\~](images/000037.jpg){.middle}m*/

**3** The remark here that the Green-elves (Q. *Laiquendi*, S.

otherwise been firmly displaced by 1951 (but see X:158) in favor of
Telerin kinship (see X:83, 89 §62, 93; X:163--4, 169--71 §§28--9;
XI:13).

**4** That is, in the same river-bounded region in which Lórien lay in
the Third Age. Tolkien's note that the Misty Mountains (Hithaeglir) "at
that remote time appear to have been continuous with the Wh*i*te
Mountains" (Ered Nimrais) would seem to imply that the Gap of Rohan,
which by the Third Age separates the two mountain ranges, was not yet in
existence during the Great March in the First Age.

**8** Here and at the first two occurrences of the name "Oropher" in
Tolkien's following, lengthy note, as first typed, the name of
Thranduil's father is given as "Rogner". Tolkien altered the latter of
these occurrences to "Oropher", and "Oropher" appears *ab initio* in the
subsequent text; so it is here supplied editorially at the first two
occurrences as well. The beginning of the lengthy note, through the
words "before the invitation of the Valar had disturbed it", editorially
clarified and combined with the sentence on which it comments, is quoted
at UT:259. I have also adopted here Christopher's editorial substitution
of "Menegroth" for the typescript's "Menegrond", which (so far as I can
determine) appears nowhere else. It must be noted though that Tolkien
himself let the name stand, despite other corrections; and further that
in the linguistic situation of the c. 1936 *Etymologies* the element
*roth* of *Menegroth* is a specifically Doriathrin element corresponding
to Noldorin (later Sindarin) *r(h)ond* (cf. V:384 s.v. ROD; also
XI:414--15, and VT46:12 s.vv. ROD, ROT-); so that "Menegrond" in the
present context may in fact be a specifically Sindarin form of the
otherwise always-employed Doriathrin "Menegroth".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1494)

**9** The opening of this footnote was previously published at UT:259.
"LR III 363" = LR:1082. "Thither they returned twice before the Last
Alliance": in the contemporary *History of Galadriel and Celeborn*, upon
the revolt in Eregion of the Mírdain at the instigation of Sauron,
Galadriel alone passed through Khazad-dûm to Lórinand (UT:237), took up
rule, and remained there until she departed to seek Celeborn at
Imladris, prior to the Council there (UT:240). At some point after the
Council, Galadriel and Celeborn departed to dwell in what later came to
be Dol Amroth until, upon the disaster in Khazad-dûm in T.A. 1981,
Galadriel took up rule in Lórinand again, and Celeborn joined her
(ibid.).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1495)

**10** There is strong evidence that Tolkien did not originally intend
to end or interrupt the text here. First, it is plain that Tolkien began
the continuation of the long note on Oropher and Thranduil at the bottom
of the same page so as to allow ample space above for continuation of
the main text. Moreover, on the verso of the page -- i.e., the original
recto of the Allen & Unwin publication notice on which this text was
typed -- Tolkien took such pains to make so full use of blank areas that
he not only continued the note on Oropher and Thranduil in the top
margin of the notice (upside-down with respect to the printing on the
notice), but also interspersed the note's final lines in the gaps
between the paragraphs of the notice. Finally, the last letters of the
last word, "changes", of the main text, before the long gap, are dim, as
though the typewriter ribbon had suddenly run out, which might have
occasioned an unplanned pause in composition, that, in the event, was
not resumed.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1496)

**11** In the top margin of the page Tolkien at some later point wrote:
"Continuation of Discussion of Silvan Elvish, diverging (when discussing
Thranduil & his removal northward) into a brief account of Isildur's
fall".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1497)

**12** I take this opportunity, though it is not strictly speaking late
writing, to record an (ultimately cancelled) manuscript rider by Tolkien
to a typescript version of what became "The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen"
in *LR* App. A. The source and context of this rider is cited at
XII:268: "Arador was the grandfather of the King". The rider, titled
"Rider A", reads:

Trolls had lived in the north of the Misty Mountains since days before
memory, especially near the Ettenmoors; but they increased in numbers
and wickedness while the realm of Angmar lasted. They then retreated
east of the mountains, but about 300 years before the War of the Ring
they returned and began to trouble Eriador, in spite of the vigilance of
the Rangers, making dens in the hills even as far from the mountains as
the North Downs. In the time of Arador a band threatened the house of
the Chieftain, which was then in woods near the Hoarwell north of the
Trollshaws, though many of the Dúnedain lived in the woods between
Hoarwell and Loudwater.

**13** Re: "as is told in the Tale of Cirion and Eorl": In published
texts at least, this tradition is not related in the texts presented in
*Cirion and Eorl* in *Unfinished Tales*, but is rather reflected in the
opening paragraphs of *The Disaster of the Gladden Fields*: cf. UT:271.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1499)

**14** In Tolkien's lengthy, digressive note on Isildur, as first typed,
the motive for Isildur's northerly rather than western route is that
"there were as yet no other roads in Eneðwaith or Minhiriath, and after
Tharbad he would have had to strike north through pathless and in part
marshy land to gain the great East-West Road of Arnor near Amon Sûl, or
go further". With this note cf. UT:278 n.6.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1500)

**15** This is no doubt a reference to at least a draft of the text
presented as *The Disaster of the Gladden Fields* in *Unfinished Tales*;
see especially p. 273 and pp. 282--3 n.20. In fact, a bit of such
drafting, apparently early, is found on the same verso page as the final
lines of the lengthy note on Oropher and Thranduil mentioned above (and
plainly predates the present text, because it is written in what was
originally the top margin of the publication notice, which had that
space been available to Tolkien when finishing the long note, he would
surely have utilized). Though very rapidly written and indeed illegible
in parts, it appears to read:

along the paths made by the Silvan Elves near the eaves of the forest.
There had been heavy rains for some days past, and Anduin \[? far?\] its
deep channel was swollen with swift water. On a drear day of Autumn,
when the Sun was sinking in the reddened cloud beyond the distant peaks
of the Mountains, they drew level with the south reaches of the Gladden
Fields \[? they heard\]. In the fading light

**17** While it may be (but probably isn't) a mere coincidence, it is
worth noting the name *Ratatoskr* in Norse mythology of the squirrel
that runs up and down the world-tree Yggdrasil bearing messages. While
this is now generally etymologized as meaning "drill-tooth" or
"bore-tooth", it had long been suggested that the initial element
*rata*-meant 'traveller' or 'climber'.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1503)

**18** The text here originally continued with an attempted but rejected
explanation of the Sindarin word *rath* 'street' as related to RATH:

In this case Sindarin shared with Quenya a stem RAP \[*sic*\] 'climb';
and the only derivative of RATH is *râth*. (The word *rath* in Sindarin
especially as applied to the steep stairway from the citadel of Minas
Tirith to the place of the Tombs appears to be related, and may be. But
its short vowel indicates descent from CE \**ratt-*.) This in the
Númenórean Sindarin of Gondor that was used in the nomenclature of
places (and generally in that of persons) was applied to all the longer
roadways and streets of Minas Tirith. Nearly all of these were on an
incline, often steep; but the connection of *rath* with 'climb' is seen
clearly in the Rath Dínen, the Silent Street, which was a steep stairway
leading down from the Citadel of Minas Tirith to the Tombs. The vowel of
*rath* was however short in the pronunciation; for 'climb' the word used
was amrad-'find a way up', derived from stem RAT, no doubt originally
related to RATH (an emphatic variation).

A stem RAP 'climb' is attested in somewhat earlier linguistic writing:
cf. PE22:127. At the end of this typescript, Tolkien writes:

The relation of -*roth* to this stem RATH is probably this: it was a
form of the agental agent seen in L. -*rātho*, sc. *amroth* was \<
*ambarātho* meaning 'up-climber, high climber'. In that case Silvan
Elvish had shifted the P.E. \**ā* \> *o*, though independently of
Sindarin, and probably without the complications seen in Sindarin, in
which P.E. \**au* and \**ā* had both become *õ* (open as in English
pronunciation of *au*), and then \> *au*, which however only remained in
stressed monosyllables, and otherwise again reverted to *o*. This
evidence of the existence of a stem *rath* 'climb' in Silvan Elvish
connects it with Lindarin rather than Sindarin ultimately. This accords
with history, since the strayers from the Great Journey evidently
belonged mainly to the rear host of the Lindar of whom Olwë was the
chieftain.

**19** "*Celebrant*" 'Silverlode': "lode" here has the same meaning that
it does in "lodestone", i.e., 'way, course'; it is derived from Old
English *lād* of the same meaning. In late Middle English it came to
mean a 'watercourse', i.e. the course of a brook or stream.

**1** The paragraph preceding this passage corresponds to the opening
paragraph of what became n.14 of the *Disaster* (UT:280). Here however
it is numbered as note 10.

### XXII The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor {#xxii-the-rivers-and-beacon-hills-of-gondor-1 .a-head-space-after}

**1** That it was two lines from a poem attributed to Cynewulf, the
*Crist*, that inspired Tolkien to create his mythology (cf. L:385, and
Carpenter's *Biography*, pp. 72, 79), is an irony that no doubt keenly
sharpened Tolkien's lament.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1514)

**2** I.e., LR:1039.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1515)

**3** No such corrected edition appeared in 1969, or during the
remainder of Tolkien's life. For the corrected map that Tolkien refers
to, and its fate, cf. UT:261--2 footnote, and 265.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1516)

**4** I.e., LR:984.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1517)

**5** I.e., LR:1114, entry for PH.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1518)

**6** Cf. L:425: "Q. permitted, indeed favoured, the 'dentals' *n*, *l*,
*r*, *s*, *t* as final consonants: no other final consonants appear in
the Q. lists." Tolkien's list here omits *s*, no doubt unintentionally.

**7** My thanks to Mr. Bibire for providing me with a photocopy of this
letter.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1520)

**8** Tolkien fell down stairs and injured his leg on June 17, 1968,
while he and his wife Edith were preparing to move house from Oxford to
Bournemouth. Cf. L:391ff., and Humphrey Carpenter's *Biography*, p. 251.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1521)

**9** I.e., LR:274, 374.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1522)

**10** The typescript actually reads *Gwathlo* here, though, as
Christopher Tolkien notes, the Isen (Angren) river must be intended.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1523)

**11** I.e., LR:1065; cf. also 1069. The name *Adorn* is given to this
short river on Pauline Baynes's 1970 poster-map of Middle-earth, which
is reproduced on p. 385 of the catalogue of the recent Bodleian
exhibition *Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth* (Catherine McIlwaine, 2018).
The annotated map that Tolkien provided to Pauline Baynes, by which this
name was apparently communicated, is likewise reproduced in the same
catalogue, on p. 383.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1524)

**12** Cf. UT:416 s.v. *Adorn.*

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1525)

**13** Pauline Baynes's "decorated map of Middle-earth" is the 1970
poster map just mentioned; and it indeed gives the name of the cape as
*Andrast*, as does the annotated map also just mentioned.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1526)

**14** The map of Middle-earth actually read *Hithaiglin*, prior to
Christopher Tolkien's correction of the name to *Hithaeglir* when he
redrew the map for *Unfinished Tales*. On the variation *Aiglos* vs.
*Aeglos* (of the name of the spear of Gil-galad, LR:243), Christopher
Tolkien notes that he substituted the latter for the former in *Of the
Rings of Power* (S:294).

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1527)

**15** I.e., LR:227.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1528)

**16** Cf. LR:1113, entry for F.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1529)

**17** In other words, the name is pronounced *Levnui,* with the sound
of English v, but is best spelt *Lefnui* in an English context.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1530)

**18** This not uncommon phenomenon of place names is exemplified
further in *The Lord of the Rings* by such forms as *Bree-hill*, *bree*
being an Anglicization of British \**brigā* (\> Welsh *bre* 'hill'); and
*Chetwood*, containing an Anglicization of British \**kaito* (\> Welsh
*coed* 'wood, forest'). Cf. XII:39 fn., 81.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1531)

**19** This was originally written as "Elvish settlement".

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1532)

**20** Tolkien provides a similar explanation for the initial element of
the name *Gondor* itself: *gond* 'stone'; cf. L:409--10. Tolkien
(appropriately) adopted this element into his Elvish languages from
*ond,* *onn* 'stone', one of a very few words thought to have survived
from the pre-Celtic languages of Britain; cf. L:410, VT30:10--14.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1533)

**21** Tolkien here deleted a parenthetical note that read: "(Many of
those who actually gave the names were mariners and settlers
\[*deleted*: who did not speak Sindarin fluently \>\] who had only small
knowledge of Quenya and whose Sindarin was imperfect.)"

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1534)

**22** The words from "and Enedhwaith" to the end of this sentence
entered as a handwritten note in the top margin. Cf. XII:328--9 n.66.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1535)

**23** *Sward* originally meant, and can still be used to mean, the skin
of the body (esp. hair-covered skin, such as the scalp), or the rind of
pork or bacon.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1536)

**24** The reference is to Gandalf's words while placing the White Crown
upon Aragorn's head, LR:968: "Now come the days of the King, and may
they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!"

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1537)

**25** Tolkien did in fact go on to devise and record Cirion's "exact
words": cf. UT:305.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1538)

**26** Cf. LR:676.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1539)

**27** See also XII:312--14.

[Back to text](#calibre_link-1540)

**28** In this footnote the name *Baldor* is (twice) an editorial
replacement for *Brego* in the original. Tolkien has confused Brego, who
completed the building of Meduseld, with his son Baldor, who passed
beyond the Door of Dunharrow. See VIII:407, LR:787, 797--8; 1068, entry
for 2512--70; and 1087, entry for 2570.
