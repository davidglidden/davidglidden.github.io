"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes."<br>

<p class="drop-cap">I write what comes to me. This simple fact shapes everything here. Not a system imposed but a practice of availability—walking the Barri Gòtic, waiting in airport lounges, catching the metro after rehearsal. Like <span class="small-caps">Cartier-Bresson</span> knew: life happens outside, in movement, in the decisive moment when attention and world coincide. The semantic types that organize this site emerged from noticing, after years of this practice, that attention arrives in recognizable qualities.</p>

Like cloud formations that have names not because we command them but because we've learned to recognize their shapes, these post types are descriptive, not prescriptive. They help name what has already moved through.

<div class="ornament philosophical"></div>

## The Practice of Availability

Before categories, before types, there is only this: staying available to what arrives. Sometimes at the morning desk with coffee and northeast light. More often in movement—the ten-minute walk between metro and rehearsal, the pause while tuning, the particular quality of attention that comes after three hours of Bach.

What <span class="small-caps">Cartier-Bresson</span> called "the decisive moment" applies to more than photography. It's that alignment of inner and outer, when what you've been carrying suddenly finds its form in what you're seeing. The [heliotrope man](/2020/05/19/heliotrope/) wasn't sought—he was encountered, recognized, received.

This isn't mystical, though mystery participates. It's the practice of keeping the channels clear, staying porous to what <span class="small-caps">Cage</span> knew about attention: it's not about controlling what you notice but noticing what you notice.

The semantic types emerged from asking, after writing: What quality of attention moved through me here? Was I looking outward or inward? Was I building or discovering? Was I documenting or transforming?

## The Qualities of Looking

### Observation
*The practice of external attention*

The eye rests on surfaces—[a man sunbathing on Rue de Petit Musc](/2020/05/19/heliotrope/), light through stained glass, the particular way someone holds their coffee cup. No interpretation, just presence. What <span class="small-caps">Berger</span> called "the act of seeing comes before words."

These pieces stay in present tense, honoring immediacy. They trust that patient attention to the ordinary reveals the extraordinary. Like the [heliotrope](/2020/05/19/heliotrope/) man who became, simply through being seen, a meditation on our fundamental nature as creatures who turn toward light.

### Fragment
*What arrives incomplete*

Not everything wants to be whole. Some thoughts are more truthful at three lines than three pages. Fragments honor the partial, the glancing, the not-yet-formed. They resist the violence of forced completion.

Often in italics, often brief, they mark places where attention touched down but didn't settle. Like archaeological shards, they suggest larger wholes without claiming to be them.

### Pattern
*Recognition across time*

When the same form appears in different contexts—the spiral in the shell and the galaxy, the teacher's gesture that echoes across generations—pattern recognition begins. These pieces map recurring structures, seeking what <span class="small-caps">Alexander</span> calls "the quality without a name."

Pattern names appear in small caps, marking them as technical terms in a developing language. Each pattern is both specific instance and general principle.

### Essay
*Sustained architectural thinking*

Sometimes attention wants to build. Not just observe but construct—laying foundations, raising walls, creating rooms others can inhabit. Essays begin with drop caps, signaling substantial engagement ahead.

The essay doesn't wander (that's meditation's gift) but moves with purpose. It makes claims, offers evidence, builds toward... not conclusions exactly, but temporary resting places. Lookouts from which to see farther.

### Meditation
*The inward spiral*

Where observation looks out, meditation turns in. Not narcissism but the recognition that inner and outer reflect each other. The personal becomes universal through specificity, not abstraction.

These pieces often combine with essay form—the architectural drive enriched by contemplative depth. They move in spirals rather than lines, returning to the same point at different altitudes.

### Gloss
*Marginalia made text*

Reading as conversation. These pieces think alongside other texts, in the margins, between the lines. They honor the tradition of manuscript annotation while recognizing that sometimes the marginal note contains the essential insight.

Formatted as whispers, they acknowledge their dependent relationship to primary texts while claiming their own space.

### Correspondence
*Direct address*

Letters, even public ones, create different intimacy. The "you" is specific, even when published. These pieces maintain epistolary attention—the quality of writing to one reader as if they were the only reader.

### Offering
*Curatorial attention*

Sometimes the gift is not creating but gathering. These pieces collect—quotes, links, images, sounds—with the attention of someone arranging flowers. Not comprehensive but composed. Each element chosen for how it converses with the others.

### Performance
*Where technical meets spiritual*

Writing about music, teaching, or any embodied practice requires particular attention. How do you convey the feeling of bow meeting string? The moment when a student suddenly understands?

These pieces braid technical precision with lived experience, refusing the false divide between craft and meaning.

### Teaching
*Attention to another's learning*

Different from performance, teaching pieces focus on the student's journey rather than the teacher's knowledge. They document the emergence of understanding, which rarely follows the path we plan.

### Interlude
*Seasonal and threshold*

Between major movements, music offers interludes—not lesser but different. These pieces mark transitions, seasons, the space between what was and what's becoming. Often brief, always temporary.

## The Modifiers

### encounter: true
*When the world stops*

Sometimes a simple observation cracks open into something larger. The ordinary moment becomes threshold. What <span class="small-caps">Castaneda</span> called "stopping the world"—when habitual perception breaks and energy shows itself directly.

Posts marked with `encounter: true` carry the ◊ symbol and extra breathing room. They document those moments when attention itself was transformed by what it attended to.

### council: true
*Collective wisdom applied*

Certain texts require more than solitary revision. They undergo review by an inter-temporal council—voices across centuries examining surface and depth equally.

Posts marked with `council: true` bear the ⟐ seal—the journey ornament opened through examination. They've been unmade and remade in witnessed space.

## Not a System but a Recognition

These types don't prescribe how to write but help recognize what was written. Like musical modes that exist whether or not we name them, these qualities of attention move through anyone who sits still long enough to notice.

The practice isn't choosing a type before writing. It's writing what comes, then asking: What quality of attention does this require from a reader? What kind of presence does it invite?

Sometimes pieces refuse single categories. An observation becomes meditation becomes encounter. An essay opens into correspondence. The types blend and blur because attention itself is fluid.

<div class="ornament philosophical"></div>

## An Invitation

This taxonomy exists not to constrain but to clarify. When you see a post marked "observation," you know it asks for external attention, present-tense awareness. When you see "meditation," prepare for spirals rather than straight lines.

But more than navigation, these types are invitations into practice. Can you read an observation with the same quality of attention that wrote it? Can you follow a meditation's spiral without rushing toward conclusions?

The semantic types teach both writer and reader: attention is multiple, generous, surprising. What we bring to the page shapes what we find there.

<blockquote class="whisper">
In the end, there's only this: We write what comes to us. We read with the attention the work requires. In between, sometimes, the extraordinary reveals itself as having been here all along.
